<i> Timing and Subtitles by the Is it raining yet? Team @ Viki</i>

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.300
<i> I heard that if stories fade away by sunlight, they become history </i>

3
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.570
<i> if they are lit by moonlight, they become legends </i>

4
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.890
<i>our story will become a legend. </i>

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.280
<i>Episode 15</i>

7
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.060
You know, this is supposed to be really romantic.

8
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.550
But, why do I keep thinking about that?

9
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.880
What is?

10
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.850
The seafood kalguksu <i>(chopped noodle soup)</i> I told you about earlier.

11
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.060
To ruin this mood, I keep on remembering that there were 12 short-necked clams in that kalguksu.

12
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.460
Even at the noodle restaurant, my mom and dad kept on fighting.

13
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.940
I was counting the clams in the noodle soup because I was nervous.

14
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.980
There were 12 of them. They were many.

15
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.040
Oh, there are 12 clams.

16
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.240
I need to say this.

17
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.760
But Mom kept on getting mad at Dad.

18
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.120
Mom would ask "what's so important?"

19
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.270
Dad wouldn't say a word and just sat there.

20
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.320
That made Mom even angrier so she would say all types of things.

21
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.810
I was counting the clams over and over again.

22
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.020
No matter how many times I've counted, there were 12 clams.

23
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.170
What exactly was so important

24
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.940
for my dad?

25
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.140
<i> You said you're a god </i>

26
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.740
<i> Grant me one wish.. </i>

27
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.420
<i> Let me meet my dad. </i>

28
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.680
<i>I would like to ask him, why he left all these burdens to me,</i>

29
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.330
<i>and if he was able to sleep</i>

30
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.430
<i>or eat just fine?</i>

31
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.100
<i>Tell him to at least take everything away from me now.</i>

32
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.070
<i>He can't even save his own daughter but how can he save the world? If I could ask that one question,</i>

33
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.450
<i>I wouldn't have any other wish.</i>

34
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.190
You never tried to look for him?

35
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.820
I didn't.

36
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.400
What if I found him but he was in Korea?

37
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.390
Suppose he was in Korea all along but he didn't come back to us.

38
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.610
What should I do then?

39
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.620
How about now?

40
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.020
Is that your real wish?

41
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.050
To meet your dad and say whatever is on your mind?

42
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.120
I think so.

43
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.080
What is it?

44
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.590
Just because.

45
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.420
It's nice. This.

46
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.900
What is?

47
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.820
Do you know why people get married?

48
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.450
Because they don't want to part after spending the whole day together.

49
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.260
However, since we live together, that we don't have to do that.

50
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.180
It's nice. Living together.

51
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.550
Is there marriage in the gods' realm too?

52
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.890
You could say there is and there isn't.

53
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.860
What do you mean?

54
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.950
You could get married if you wanted, but exclusivity doesn't apply and it's not binding.

55
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.010
What?

56
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.490
Then, you could cheat anytime you want?

57
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.020
It's very freewheeling.

58
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.660
That's why Lady Yoo Hwa's mom is uncertain.

59
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.520
So who exactly is this Lady Yoo Hwa?

60
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.530
Your daughter.

61
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.230
Joo Mong's mom, King Yoo Ri's maternal grandmother. Since you are King Yoo Ri's maternal grandfather, she's your wife.

62
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.560
I told you I am single.

63
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.680
Ha! It's pointless pretending to be unmarried.

64
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.420
It seems like you're sulking.

65
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.820
What?

66
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.150
Give me a glass of water please.

67
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.800
Seriously, why would law and institutions exist?

68
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.410
Legal authority and binding force, those are all sources of power.

69
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.140
What? Freewheeling? It's not as if this was the animal kingdom.

70
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.420
Is it because they are Natural Men and Women?

71
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.790
Oh?

72
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.060
By chance, is something like polygamy allowed in the gods' realm?

73
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.530
How did you know?

74
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.360
There are goddesses who have many husbands.

75
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.000
Really?

76
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.370
Of course.

77
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.930
They don't age nor die. How could they devote themselves to one man or one woman for such a long time?

78
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.930
Why?

79
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.370
Then you,

80
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.360
how many times were you married?

81
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.640
I told you I have never been married.

82
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.090
Then, who is Lady Yoo Hwa?

83
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.530
Woman, get your act together.

84
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.930
Please give me another glass of water.

85
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.420
One more.

86
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.030
Look here,

87
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.770
what are you plotting?

88
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.050
Can't you tell? I am trying to stay here longer, since I don't want to go upstairs to sleep.

89
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.490
What?

90
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.420
If you stay, if you don't leave, what are you planning to do?

91
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.790
Nam Soo Ri isn't coming home tonight because of a part-time job.

92
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.660
Just happens.

93
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.050
S-so?

94
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.890
So...

95
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.070
you and I...

96
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.880
let's watch TV.

97
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.790
TV?

98
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.610
Sit down.

99
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.830
- Yoon So Ah. 
 - Yes?

100
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.660
Seriously.

101
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.980
What did you see to act like this?

102
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.200
Something called a diary?

103
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.500
What did you say?

104
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.570
I don't offer my lap to anyone to lie on.

105
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.130
Why did you read my diary?

106
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.970
Did you't write it so I could read it? 20 years ago at that.

107
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:13.920
What?

108
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.870
Like you said, I found a poem you wrote when you were just a child.

109
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.360
Title, "Father's Lap".

110
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.070
"Father's lap is mine.

111
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.180
"Yoo Sang Yoo, get out. Yoo Sang Yoo, I curse you."

112
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.880
Do you call that a poem?

113
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.760
You said you were pretty good at writing poems when you were a kid.

114
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.320
There is a rerun for "Male Gods' Dinner".
<i>(a TV-show with good-looking chefs)</i>

115
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.730
Oh, you're being too obvious.

116
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.190
If I had such a great talent like yours,

117
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.440
I will be in charge of cooking until I had to leave.

118
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.630
When are you leaving?

119
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.120
The messenger will come.

120
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.070
It could be tomorrow for all we know.

121
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.560
I guess we are on a day-to-day basis. Like a terminal patient.

122
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.600
When I was an intern,

123
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.330
whenever I had to meet terminal patients or their family members,

124
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.430
I would feel guilty for some reason.

125
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.590
How would I be able to understand how they really feel?

126
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:40.130
I would comfort them with this and that, as I'd been taught and trained,

127
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:45.690
but to be honest, I couldn't even begin to fathom how they felt.

128
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.030
Crying with them would have been more valuable than all those words

129
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.630
that would often fall unaccounted.

130
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:57.230
But I think I still learned something.

131
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.930
How they prepared to say their farewell,

132
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.820
the things left behind after the farewell.

133
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:10.660
For the families left behind or for me now,

134
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.630
people find a reason to live on without withering away.

135
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.880
The wandering mind will

136
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.660
find a place to stay.

137
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.570
Can I ask you a question?

138
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.330
How about you?

139
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.750
How will you live?

140
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:51.710
I will only live for 40 to 50 more years, but there is no end for you.

141
00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:01.180
Is it alright for me to desire you?

142
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.980
As long as it's possible, for a long long time,

143
00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.640
to live without forgetting me.

144
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.340
What are you doing?

145
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.540
You're awake?

146
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:36.180
I was up early and I had nothing to do. So I watched the rerun of Male Gods' Dinner.

147
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.770
So?

148
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.240
So?

149
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.080
Wait.

150
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.360
Are you making breakfast for me?

151
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.200
So you're the sort of guy who makes breakfast, the type that I've only heard about.

152
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.930
It's because I am hungry.

153
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.820
Really?

154
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.550
Then, I will go back to sleep.

155
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.360
I usually skip breakfast.

156
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.580
Sit right there.

157
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.680
If I have breakfast, I don't feel good.

158
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.050
Just sit.

159
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:21.000
I will brush my teeth, wash my face and sit at the breakfast table with reverence.

160
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:37.020
He's cute but I can't tell him he's cute. I think he will get really angry.

161
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.870
Should I give it a try? What if I change into a water lily?

162
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.110
It's breakfast but this is a feast.

163
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.400
Who will eat it all?

164
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.490
Do you know how much food waste pollutes the environment—

165
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.060
If it's to your liking, just say you like it. Simple.

166
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.430
Sit.

167
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.600
Let's eat.

168
00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.770
I said eat.

169
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.440
This is how it feels

170
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.220
to have a meal prepared for you.

171
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.930
Eat.

172
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.020
Let's eat.

173
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.710
I locked the door, but there was no potted plant <i>(to hide the keys under)</i> .

174
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.400
He came here to give me the keys. Since there was no potted plant.

175
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.400
I worried about it quite a bit. It didn't seem like you would be going to the clinic for a while.

176
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.260
Should I send it by quick messenger, mail, or call you over to come get it?

177
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.270
Who are you calling over?

178
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.530
That's right. That's why I came myself.

179
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.160
Ah, then at least have a cup of tea...

180
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.340
Who drinks tea first thing in the morning?

181
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.330
There's no law saying I can't have tea first thing in the morning.

182
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.800
In my home, there is such a thing.

183
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.890
You can't drink tea in the morning in my home.

184
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.910
In my house we have breakfast.

185
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.870
If you haven't eaten, eat before you go.

186
00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.330
CEO Sin is a really busy person so...

187
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.210
If it's okay, I'll have a little bit.

188
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.330
Wow, Yoon So Ah has great cooking skills.

189
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:17.630
I did it. This woman didn't lift a finger.

190
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.790
I did it all.

191
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.920
Ah, is that so?

192
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.690
You must not know but this woman has the worst cooking skills.

193
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.950
She also falls asleep wherever. If she just lays down her head, she's out like a light.

194
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.400
So, I always carry her in my arms

195
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:41.510
and lay her in her bed. I do that. It's really bothersome.

196
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.820
Is that the only thing? She doesn't know how to turn on her porch light

197
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.030
so I always turn it on for her.

198
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.750
She doesn't clean very often so I do that for her.

199
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.980
I bathe every morning

200
00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:01.300
and unsuitably she's very embarrassed at the sight of an undressed male god's body.

201
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.070
Hey.

202
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.100
Am I wrong?

203
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.400
You said that no matter how much you see it, you don't get used to it, right?

204
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.090
Hey.

205
00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.710
Was I wrong?

206
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:16.680
Ah, did you say that you never get tired of seeing it?

207
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.960
Let's eat.

208
00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.280
Since you live together, you know a lot about her.

209
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:33.990
Ah right, Yoon So Ah. I'm  your clinic's new landlord.

210
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.550
Oh! Really?

211
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.850
Are you for real?

212
00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.370
Is that why you reduced my rent and security deposit?

213
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.670
I told you, didn't I?

214
00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:50.900
That I would just buy your building. That I have lots of money.

215
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.180
Landlord.

216
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.770
Thank you so much. I really owe you so much.

217
00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:04.370
No, I did that for all the tenants in <i>my</i> building.

218
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.870
Because Chairman Sin has been too greedy of late, they seem to have suffered a lot.

219
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.840
Thank you so much.

220
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.320
I really feel secure now.

221
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.850
It's nothing.

222
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:18.720
I should become a good landlord.

223
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.630
CEO Sin will definitely be a good landlord...

224
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.980
I am a king!

225
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:31.260
I'm saying that I'm a king.

226
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.680
That traces of the passage of time in this house look really nice.

227
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.650
I was born in this house, although half of it is now owned by the banks.

228
00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.840
<i>It's okay, it's okay,</i>

229
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.840
<i>stay still.</i>

230
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.390
- Yoon So Ah. Did we really never meet before?

231
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.770
Oh, we didn't, at least as far as I remember.

232
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.690
Then why do I keep...

233
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.490
What nonsense are you spouting?

234
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.470
Why don't you sit?

235
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.280
Drinking tea after a meal is a law in my house.

236
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.620
Bring us some tea please.

237
00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:40.350
What is this clumsy "head of the household" sense he's trying to give?

238
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.040
That looks so foreign.

239
00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:53.420
A god who is the king of the Water Kingdom and a half-god half-human.

240
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.660
Why did he change his clothes?

241
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.580
Give it to me in my cup.

242
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.550
I have my own personal cup. It's called Yong Yong.

243
00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.500
It's a very artistic cup depicting the good relationship between the owner and his servant.

244
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.950
I bought it for this woman after I did that thing called a "part-time job".

245
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.740
Give it to me in my cup.

246
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:31.680
Why don't you just drink it in this cup for today?

247
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.390
If you wish, I'll do as you say.

248
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.030
I'm going to go do the dishes.

249
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.540
You look good together.

250
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:50.910
If you know that then why did you come? Keys?

251
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.450
Did you think I'd blink an eye at your childish provocation?

252
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:57.820
Even if I'm no match, I can find some loop-holes if I keep poking.

253
00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.430
I already told you that the thing that I'm best at is waiting.

254
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:06.470
Throughout your life, you'll realize how seriously futile your waiting is.

255
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:10.710
And you'll feel like this life is a failure.

256
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.100
I'm envious of your confidence.

257
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.020
I'm a king.

258
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:21.250
Yoon So Ah told me that I needn't feel intimidated by things like birth origin.

259
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:26.510
- She was just saying it.
 - Anyhow, time is on my side.

260
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.820
- And looking at it, it seems like money is on my side as well. 
 - I am a king.

261
00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:36.750
I'm a building owner. Would you care to see whether money or being a king is more powerful here?

262
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.490
What?

263
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.320
- Yoon So Ah.
- Yes?

264
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.590
You forgot that the day after tomorrow you're supposed to work on the farm didn't you?

265
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.710
I'm sorry.

266
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:57.580
This makes it difficult for me. Being close is one thing but a contract is a contract.

267
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:02.400
I'm sorry. Lately my mind has been scattered. You're going out in the afternoon, right? I'll go—

268
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.550
Where are you going?

269
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.880
I don't know what you want her to do but whatever it is, it's a no.

270
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.330
Yoon So Ah is indebted to me. She incurred a cancellation fee when she broke her contract to sell me that land.

271
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:19.470
She needs to earn money and pay back this debt to be done with this contract.

272
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.880
I'll see you then.

273
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.950
It's because you didn't let me sell that land.

274
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:46.130
Give me some money. My servant owes a cancellation fee to that half-god half-human because she didn't sell him that land.

275
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.000
Because we are the reason that she has that debt...

276
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.680
Don't make me laugh.

277
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.660
You look like you've just gotten a call from Ha Baek.

278
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.110
CEO Sin is a pretty good player. He listens very well to his coach.

279
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:06.030
That's a name I still don't want to hear. Don't say it if you can help it.

280
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:10.420
No. I'm going to keep saying it until you get tired of it.

281
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.450
Now what are you play-acting?

282
00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:19.520
I heard that it's women's romantic fantasy to be served breakfast by the man they love.

283
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.090
- It's must be the romantic fantasy of foolish human women.
- Be a human woman just for a bit.

284
00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.780
Don't I need a man that I love to do that?

285
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.650
How many steps do I have left? 50? 100?

286
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.590
Will I be able to even reach you?

287
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.760
- Get out. I need to shower.
- Alright.

288
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:51.420
She's the most difficult woman in the world.

289
00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.840
I know that, I do.

290
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.400
What's up?

291
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.540
I can't today, my schedule is filled to the brim.

292
00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.490
I'll contact you.

293
00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:22.620
When I go back to the gods' realm I'm going to turn one of them into a mackerel and the other into a sparrow.

294
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.150
<i>Yes, Lord Ha Baek.</i>

295
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.850
Are you earning lots of money?

296
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:44.300
<i>What? Yes. I have a lot of duck boat customers waiting. Ah, Lord Joo Dong called me.</i>

297
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.040
What? Where is he? Why isn't he coming?

298
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.010
<i>He said that he's coming soon and not to go anywhere and wait for him.</i>

299
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:54.420
But why did he call you and not me?

300
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:58.880
<i>Moo Ra told him not to call you because you keep asking for money.</i>

301
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.890
How impertinent.

302
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.860
<i>That person is apparently the person who saved me.</i>

303
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.820
<i>That person. But...</i>

304
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:26.110
<i>What? What else are you saying?</i>

305
00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:39.300
What is she saying? The part where she says that that person saved her is good

306
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:46.560
"but,"  "but,"  but... That's the part that makes me uncomfortable.

307
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.860
I'm a little late. The person who was supposed to take the shift after me at the convenience store was late.

308
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.910
- Nam Soo Ri.
- Yes?

309
00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.320
It's always the same dream but I can't just ignore it.

310
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.910
I can't hear the most important part.

311
00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.960
Is there no fix for this?

312
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:17.230
Theres... there's nothing.

313
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.310
Why?

314
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.030
<i>- What is it? </i> 
- Is anything going on with you?

315
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:37.110
What? Your tone makes it sound like there should be something going on with me.

316
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.410
Your dating life has gone badly and now you're all twisted up.

317
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.480
There's nothing wrong with my dating life.

318
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.650
<i>Then the genetic material of your dating cells is abnormal. Does it make any sense to love so that you can break up?</i>

319
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:52.720
I've heard of breaking up because you're in love but I've never heard of loving in order to break up.

320
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:57.510
You left out 'well', to break up well.

321
00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:04.190
- I'm hanging up now.
- Is the boyfriend that saved you doing well?

322
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:11.920
Is someone having a ridiculous relationship like that?

323
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.080
You are trying really hard even though you know you can't do it.

324
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.270
I heard that there's a thing called interest if you borrow money.

325
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.130
When I go back to the Water Kingdom, I'll give you a lot.

326
00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.300
Why would I need money in the gods' realm?

327
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.770
I'm not saying that I'd give you interest in the form of money. If you need anything, tell me.

328
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.590
Would you give me your kingship?

329
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.580
Of course something like that can't happen.

330
00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.000
No matter how much I pick on you, I don't want to see that kind of grief.

331
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.810
- I want to see you for a long time.
- Can you really not do it?

332
00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:13.560
I could give you money or a diamond ring, but Moo Ra doesn't want me to.

333
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.640
I'm the kind of man who listens to his woman.

334
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.920
I saw this on the internet. They call that kind of thing "being whipped".

335
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.420
I like "being whipped".

336
00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.320
- I'm leaving.
- Wait.

337
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.190
- I have some business with you too.
- What?

338
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.040
What is it?

339
00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:50.650
What kind of woman is Moo Ra?

340
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:57.330
Did you meet with Ha Baek? Did you attack his weakest link?

341
00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.870
It's not like that.

342
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:04.670
You did well. Show him how superior you are and how lacking he is here.

343
00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:09.890
- Do you mean it?
- Even if he goes, I can't just send him like this. I'm going to shrivel him up and then send him.

344
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:15.830
No, rather than sending him all shriveled up, I'm going to burn him to a crisp and then send him.

345
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:21.040
You gods really don't have any middle ground.

346
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.000
Moo Ra is the most loyal among us. You know this too.

347
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.980
- But if you turn your back on her, she's ruthless.
- Are you acting like this even though you know that about her?

348
00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:34.170
I'm an exception of course. My relationship with Moo Ra is beyond that.

349
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:39.190
I've made a mistake coming to you. You don't know Moo Ra very well either.

350
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.580
You don't know Moo Ra's true heart, right?

351
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.680
I'm really no match for you.

352
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.020
You don't know anything but you know everything. And you know everything but you don't know anything.

353
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.370
That's the difference between you and me.

354
00:30:56.370 --> 00:31:01.720
Yes.  What you say is correct. I can't grasp it.

355
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.290
I can't get a feel for how far I need to go.

356
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:10.790
If you pay me a consultation fee, I'll give you advice.

357
00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.560
These merciless gods. Are they really going to act like this to the end?

358
00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:27.450
- Where are you going?
- Oh?

359
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.620
I'm going to work to pay back the cancellation fee.

360
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.160
I told you not to go.

361
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.930
I'm sorry. He said that he would follow me here.

362
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.300
He's a great worker.

363
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:53.190
I don't know much about the gods' realm but the Ha Baek that I've heard about would never do something like that.

364
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.160
There's a reason that Hye Ra is unhappy with him.

365
00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:04.520
He's saying he will pay for the breach of the contract that way. I told him I get paid the daily wage, but I can't get through to him.

366
00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.350
Isn't it that he doesn't understand the concept of a daily wage?

367
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:11.890
If he didn't know about it then I could just explain it to him, but it turns out that he knew about it.

368
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:15.630
He read about "emperor's labor". <i>(rich convicts who work to compensate for a fine, abuse the system by making even $500,000 daily in prison)</i>

369
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:20.560
Even a human CEO makes ₩5 million ($500,000), so my labor would be priceless.

370
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.900
However I'll give him the honor of putting a price on my labor. Go.

371
00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:31.790
So, what is the price he set for the labor of a king?

372
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:38.400
- $50 million.
- Oh, $50 million?

373
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.920
He said that after you deduct the cancellation fee, he'll accept the rest in cash.

374
00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.680
$50 million?

375
00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.620
You've found out the power of money, even if your strategy was a bit clumsy.

376
00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.720
Do you think that if Miss Yoon So Ah had plenty of money, there would be no chance for me to get involved with her?

377
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.330
Regardless of whether she's rich or not, you won't have a place in her heart.

378
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.790
You really don't know her.

379
00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.000
Is that so?

380
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.970
Then I will tell you one thing that you are not aware of.

381
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.420
- There is nothing I am not aware of. 
 - There is.

382
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.730
Something you will never know as a god.

383
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:26.050
Something I am able to know because I am a human.

384
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.580
What?

385
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.690
Human beings...

386
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:36.840
they are lonely from the moment they are born.

387
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.170
Jin Geon, what is it?

388
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.130
- Someone came looking for you. 
 - Who?

389
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.660
- He left something for you.
 - What?

390
00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.750
Please give me your hand.

391
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.120
Good, well done.

392
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.940
This won't be planted on that side. It was brought there by mistake.

393
00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.450
I will hold this.

394
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.160
It's okay.

395
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.770
Go.

396
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.750
No, he's not a kid.

397
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:28.350
If gods in the Water Kingdom heard that, they will be flabbergasted. A kid?

398
00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.610
I am really curious,

399
00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.680
is he someone that great?

400
00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.870
I don't know too well.

401
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:40.350
My whole world consisted of the cave.

402
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:46.890
However, of the stories about the gods' realm that Joo Geol Rin sometimes told me, half were about Ha Baek.

403
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:50.480
Inside the cave, Ha Baek seemed like the god of gods.

404
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.230
The god of gods?

405
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:56.320
Not all gods have equal divine powers.

406
00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.570
What's possible for some isn't possible for others.

407
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:04.410
However, Ha Baek is a being in which all powers are present.

408
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.420
Since he was born a king.

409
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.480
However, even for Ha Baek, there are two things he can't do.

410
00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.070
He can't revive what's dead.

411
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.490
And he doesn't have the power I have.

412
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.280
Still, Ha Baek is not intimidated by me in the least.

413
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.980
To be honest, I liked that.

414
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:33.670
But... are you okay?

415
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:37.470
He might have to leave tomorrow.

416
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:42.220
He might be gone when you wake up in the morning.

417
00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:47.470
Still, he came back

418
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:50.140
so that I will be able to live on.

419
00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.240
Are you finished?

420
00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.090
Yes.

421
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.960
$50 million, that's cheap for my labor.

422
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.880
Give it to me.

423
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.780
What are you doing? It doesn't suit you.

424
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.740
Why not?

425
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:25.030
You still don't get it. How I could be attractive in so many different ways.

426
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.040
Should I show you?

427
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.440
Don't.

428
00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.780
Don't do such things.

429
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.060
Before your heart bursts from pounding so hard, hold on tight.

430
00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.390
I said don't.

431
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.420
Seriously.

432
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.870
I said don't.

433
00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:00.180
How is it? Does your heart pound?

434
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:05.210
According to the internet, human females call this sexy.

435
00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:18.610
Please bend down.

436
00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.240
What is it all of a sudden?

437
00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.180
Your heart is okay?

438
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:27.910
My heart is perfectly fine and I feel like I will become a chicken and fly away.<i> (="so cheesy I'll get goosebumps")</i>

439
00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.560
Come this way. Take a seat.

440
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.970
Why do you try to stand out like this? This isn't like you.

441
00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:49.470
Isn't it similar to how you snuck out in front of the hourse to look at me from behind?

442
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:50.770
What?

443
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.870
You said that you have to live for 40 to 50 more years.

444
00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:00.380
Things being like that,

445
00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:04.240
you need to have more memories of me to last you till then.

446
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:10.020
You're so good at saying such things in an indifferent way.

447
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.090
I am not saying this because I am an indifferent person.

448
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.260
You know that I am selfish.

449
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:43.180
I am saying this because I am selfish.

450
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.650
As much as possible,

451
00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.820
for a long long time,

452
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:55.530
don't be

453
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:07.310
I will

454
00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:13.230
remember you for a long long time.

455
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.210
Are you angry because your daily wage wasn't $50 million?

456
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:48.450
He said since you're an emperor, he will give you $5,000 for a daily wage. So go work there everyday.

457
00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:52.150
If you just work for 10 days, it will be more than enough to pay for the breach of the contract.

458
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:55.000
If we both earn money....

459
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.710
That's a funny thing to say. If we both earn money.

460
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:07.570
We will go tomorrow and the day after...

461
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:12.150
Let's go there together every day.

462
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:16.740
Let's work together.

463
00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.840
Let's stay together.

464
00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.020
Okay.

465
00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.710
Where have you been?

466
00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.050
Look at you.

467
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:09.080
What brings you here?

468
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.550
Good news.

469
00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.500

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:47.370
Even if it's just empty words,

510
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.420
why aren't you asking me to stay?

511
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.830
Why?

512
00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:00.240
If I ask you to stay, will you not go?

513
00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:06.260
No, that's not possible.

514
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:11.420
Exactly. Why are you testing me?

515
00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.530
I am not the type of woman who stands in the way of her man's future.

516
00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:32.760
I will tell you why I am clinging on to you.

517
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.820
Think about it.

518
00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:39.950
You're awesome because you're the king of the gods' realm. If you are not a king and you don't have divine powers, what will you do here?

519
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:42.990
You are an unemployed person who just takes baths every day.

520
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:46.800
You don't like to work. You just want to drive every day.

521
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.140
I have to feed you.

522
00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:57.030
"I will give up house and money. All I need is you". Don't watch this kind of movies.

523
00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:00.750
If you come like that, the girl will give up on you.

524
00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:22.960
He's so soft-hearted. How will he be a king?

537
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.330
Lord Ha Baek.

538
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.610
- I am back. 
 - Why are you here now?

539
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:30.520
Since I have an ID, there are so many places I can work.

540
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:35.270
The 24-hour BBQ restaurant asked me to come. During the day, I went to the duck boat part-time job—

541
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.430
- Wrap it up. 
 - Pardon?

542
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:38.730
The messenger came.

543
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:41.470
I see. So we really are going back now.

544
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:44.810
So wrap it up ahead of time. So something like what happened last time won't happen.

545
00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:46.240
Yes.

546
00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.050
Are you that happy?

547
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:22.030
You should have seen his face too. He looked as if the sky fell on him.

548
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:25.360
Our goddess is really unhappy with Ha Baek.

549
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:31.670
I was almost tempted to not tell him that messenger came so he wouldn't be able to return.

550
00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:35.550
That's a bit harsh to say just because you're angry.

551
00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:40.960
If Ha Baek can't become a king, he will die. Will you be able to live on after losing him?

552
00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:46.470
Ha Baek knows this very well so it's not like he's contemplating whether to return or not.

553
00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:49.770
So please give him a break.

554
00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:52.050
So annoying.

555
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:55.470
Do you like me or Ha Baek more? 
 <i> Please be mine. Hye Ra </i>

556
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.420
Huh? Who do you like better?

557
00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.630
You, you.

558
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:07.920
What?

559
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:13.290
You? You like me more, not Ha Baek?

560
00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:15.200
Yeah you.

561
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:20.170
What are you doing?

562
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:26.410
Oh, this?

563
00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:30.220
Your fans sent it to you.

564
00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.960
I heard that you got angry and said that you didn't want your fans sending you gifts.

565
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.720
I heard that your fans won't send you gifts because they're scared of you.

566
00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:43.240
But Manager Kim is having a difficult time because of the fans who keep sending you gifts.

567
00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:47.750
So I asked him to give them to me because I like anything that has your face on it.

568
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:05.230
Oh and that box of gifts that you had in your room...

569
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:10.120
Oh yeah that. I ate the cookies that were in there.

570
00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.950
Oh, you did well.

571
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:16.190
But why are you holding onto that?

572
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:17.690
What?

573
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:23.870
I told Manager Kim to throw it away and he put it here again.

574
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:26.820
Would Manager Kim know anything?

575
00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:31.450
You're a real goddess; why would you need the love of humans?

576
00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:34.290
This mere sock is ridiculous to you.

577
00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:37.220
You even turn up your nose at my diamonds, right?

578
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.970
Yeah.

579
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:46.200
Only lowly human beings cling on to these things,

580
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.700
I'll take care of it. I like these things because they have your face on them.

581
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.440
What are you doing?

582
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.770
Where are you going?

583
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.370
Would you like to come with me?

584
00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:52.050
It's here.

585
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:56.150
This is the place where I made that foolish decision.

586
00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:01.600
December 21, 2004, at 11:35 pm.

587
00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.560
I even remember the time accurately.

588
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:13.410
<i>After my father left us, I tenaciously tried to become happy by tenaciously studying hard.</i>

589
00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:20.940
<i>The truth that I believed in was, as you said, what I wanted to believe in.</i>

590
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:25.210
<i>As you said, it's because that was a much easier and less difficult path.</i>

591
00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:28.700
<i>You father abandoned us. Just think of it that way.</i>

592
00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:34.500
<i>If I hadn't done it that way, I would have had to spend my whole youth trying to understand my father.</i>

593
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:41.330
<i>But, my mother who did that was also crumbling behind my back.</i>

594
00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.070
I really hated my mother.

595
00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:50.200
After my mother died, I was really holding on well.

596
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.500
On that day too,

597
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:59.660
I was fine at school, but all of a sudden I was hit

598
00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:06.210
by a certain feeling. It suddenly took hold of me

599
00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:13.960
and grew enormously out of my control and pushed me to this place.

600
00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:19.430
Why did God,

601
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:27.230
among all the many people in the world, neglect my life?

602
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:32.600
Why was only I left out?

603
00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:39.320
Why did he hate only me?

604
00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:50.670
<i>If my father answered my phone call, it meant that God loved me.</i>

605
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:56.490
<i>If he didn't answer my phone, it meant that God really hated me.</i>

606
00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:58.800
<i>I made my decision that way.</i>

607
00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.880
<i>Please.</i>

608
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:09.660
<i>The customer is not available to answer the phone at this moment...</i>

609
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.740
<i>My father's phone, which was turned off, wasn't turned on to the end.</i>

610
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:24.540
<i>I decided to take the most terrible revenge in the world.</i>

611
00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:28.520
<i>I'm going to make him regret it his whole life.</i>

612
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:39.840
Of course, it now remains in my memory as my most embarrassing moment.

613
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:52.440
I am once again standing in front of a huge goodbye.

614
00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:57.640
How my heart really is...

615
00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:05.030
Is it as still the way it was when I threw myself in

616
00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:11.890
or has it matured?

617
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:15.350
I was curious about it.

618
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:26.440
Thank you for giving me love.

619
00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.550
Let's go home and eat now.

620
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:12.730
Hey! I've been going over it in my head, what the heck are you plotting?

621
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.750
Why are you in that state?

622
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:16.340
I need to become a human?

623
00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:22.090
I'm a complete human being with 22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes,

624
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:27.310
but because you told me to become a human, I wondered if you mean't something else and studied up on it.

625
00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:31.310
I even went so far as getting my DNA sequenced.

626
00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:39.180
Steam came out of my head and I took so many headache pills.

627
00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:43.160
I did that! I had forgotten it all because it's been so long since I graduated!

628
00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:46.950
Why did you have to make me study again?

629
00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.790
Ja Ya, why are you being like this?

630
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:54.670
This guy is looking down on me!

631
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:58.880
If you are a church oppa be a church oppa. Why are you making me study?

632
00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:03.880
My grandfather put you up to it didn't he? I'm right, aren't I? How much did you get?

633
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:10.340
You did, didn't you? Tell me! You did, didn't you!

634
00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:13.290
How much did you get? Was it a lot?

635
00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:16.330
Let go.

636
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:18.050
Are you stupid?

637
00:59:18.050 --> 00:59:21.300
What's the relationship between chasing Yoon So Ah out of her hospital space and getting a DNA sequencing test?

638
00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.610
That's what I'm asking you.

639
00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:26.010
Do you really like Yoon So Ah?

640
00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.340
Sin Ja Ya, stop doing that job that you're doing.

641
00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:36.710
You might need brains for your job but don't you need a heart (chest) as well? <i> (Word chest also means heart)</i>

642
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:38.160
What are you saying?

643
00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:42.260
I have no interest in being a glamour model.

644
00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:49.120
Work on your heart a little bit more, and become a human.

645
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:55.400
What my chest... become a human?

646
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.340
Why is my homework increasing?

647
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:05.610
<i>Goddess Hye Ra</i>

648
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.350
Oh.

649
01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:14.170
What is it? Is this the first time you've seen me shirtless?

650
01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:18.560
By any chance is that towel something that a fan gave me?

651
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.210
Ah, yeah I really like it because it has your name on it.

652
01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.510
That guy really.

653
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:49.030
I only have a couple of those.

654
01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.090
<i> You know how I feel. Be mine (Hae Ra) </i>

655
01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.540
What are you doing?

656
01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:13.920
This is really hydrating.

657
01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.420
You...

658
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:17.500
What?

659
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:25.860
Why are you like that?

660
01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.810
- You and that...
- By any chance

661
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:29.230
is it because I'm using your fan's presents?

662
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:31.920
No. Would I do that?

663
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.710
Didn't you say you hated them? These mere presents from humans?

664
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:37.740
I hate them. They're grubby.

665
01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.800
Tell your fans that it's alright to send you presents again.

666
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.040
Why are you acting so proud? It's not healthy.

667
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.050
What do you know?

668
01:01:57.370 --> 01:02:02.170
I didn't know before but I know now.

669
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:12.810
This design is not great.

670
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.140
Is it 50 steps or 100 steps?

671
01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:24.190
Or have I already gone through the door?

672
01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:28.580
Why don't I try standing face-to-face with your truth.

673
01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.240
Get lost.

674
01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.830
Okay.

675
01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:58.420
Diamond rings are not her style. I need to get a gold ring.

676
01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:00.180
Gold ring...

677
01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:13.250
Why are you here this late at night?

678
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.570
What are you doing?

679
01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:17.910
I finally solved the last piece of the puzzle.

680
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:21.630
- What?
- I told you that you kept coming to me in my dreams.

681
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:24.420
Oh you're talking about that. If you're here you might as well eat before you go.

682
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:26.410
Food is not important right now.

683
01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:29.380
No, food is important to me. I wanted to eat just the two of us

684
01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.830
but since my only friend in the world has come, there's nothing I can do about it.

685
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:36.690
But you're really an inconvenience.

686
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:38.090
I told you last time, didn't I?

687
01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:42.490
At first I wasn't sure about it but I saw a faint image of someone coming to me and trying to say something.

688
01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:44.460
I don't know why but I thought of you.

689
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:49.340
Then, a few days later, you came in my dream soaked through with rain; you were saying something but I couldn't hear it.

690
01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:53.200
But then a couple days ago I could hear what you were saying.

691
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.810
<i>That person</i>

692
01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:57.790
<i>That person? What person?</i>

693
01:03:57.790 --> 01:04:00.140
<i>That person</i>

694
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:09.860
<i>is the person who saved me, they say, that person.</i>

695
01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.160
<i>But</i>

696
01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.400
So I thought it was obviously your boyfriend.

697
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:20.040
I was really mad at you for coming into my dreams to brag about your boyfriend. Just ask Nam Soo Ri.

698
01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.250
Friend, can you stop delaying and get to the point? I have things to take care of.

699
01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:26.860
I said "but"!

700
01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:27.830
But?

701
01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:33.920
Yeah! You said "but". That means that a twist is coming.

702
01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:58.330
That "but" kept bothering me but the words that came after frustratingly never came.

703
01:04:58.330 --> 01:04:59.740
Was it something like "The Usual Suspects?"

704
01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.220
It's more than that. But anyway that's how it was.

705
01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:07.470
It was like that but I heard it just now.

706
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:09.350
Ok, congratulations.

707
01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:11.280
What did I tell you?

708
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.540
You said something very big.

709
01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:17.560
You said that's the person who saved me but

710
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.770
<i>That's the person who saved me, they say, </i>

711
01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:23.880
<i>but...</i>

712
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.930
<i>but the person wh saved you</i>

713
01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:28.210
<i>the person who saved me</i>

714
01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:31.820
<i>is going to be the one who brings me death.</i>

715
01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:32.760
What?

716
01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:36.350
The person who saved you is going to be the one who brings you death.

717
01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:38.540
You're going to die!

718
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:41.880
What?

719
01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:53.260

Our descendant is going to die?

726
01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:25.450
No.

727
01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:26.780
I think today will be the last time.

728
01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.900
Why are you doing this to me?

729
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.120
The divine power you need to use on your return, you will use it on her.

730
01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.230
I told you it's the god's duty to protect.

731
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:36.960
- If you can't become a king, then 
 - What will happen if I stop existing?

732
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.390
Stop saying ridiculous things.

733
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:41.870
If I can't save even her, how can I be called a king?

734
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:43.520
Whatever it may be, is it more important that your death?

735
01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.600
You are going to die?

736
01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.090
I told you I will protect you.

737
01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:48.850
You will disappear from my memory?

738
01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:50.430
I love you.
