00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,520
I'm saying this because the day is just right.

I'm saying this because you're still eye-blindingly bright.

6
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,540
I'm saying this because all those first loves were you.

7
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,380
On another right day, will you be the bride of this Goryeo man?

- Unni? <br> - Huh?

23
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,420
- Can you see us? <br> - Yes.

24
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,930
Wow! How long has it been? How have you been?

25
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,010
Girl! You see us now!

26
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,920
Jeez. Have you been doing well?

27
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,130

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,730
Congratulations on your marriage!

32
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,210
Congratulations.

33
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,530
Yeah!

34
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,000
Drink it. It'll help you forget this life's memories.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,560
T-Thank you.

36
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,160
What kind of nonsense is this? How can I be served with my chauffeur?

37
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,530
How can I drink the same thing?

38
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,660
In here, everybody gets the same cup of tea.

39
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,270
What bullshit is that? I'm still mad that I'm dead.

40
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:39,210
How can you treat me the same way as that life that's not even worth this watch?

41
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,510
Like I said, here everybody gets the same cup of tea.

42
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:50,880
Your watch has already stopped and anything that you have

43
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,360
won't be able to cross that door.

44
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,620
You lived as a strong man in your life? But as you go behind that door, you'll realize...

45
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,110
You sin with your eyes, sin with your mouth,

46
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:10,970
sin with your hands and feet, sin with your heart. How strong they can be.

47
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,660
How far deep down to Hell that will pull you.

48
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,190
<i>You really don't want to go on a blind date?</i>

49
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,660
<i>I told you I don't like a chef.</i>

50
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,670
<i>He's not the chef. This time, it's my client.</i>

51
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:48,340
<i>He's a chaebol. He's rich. He's handsome. Above all, he's young.</i>

52
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,140
<i>He likes older ladies. His request isn't something weird, either.</i>

53
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,350
<i>It's something with his inheritance. What do you think?</i>

54
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,740
Blind date?

55
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,140
What the... it's new.

56
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,150
What's going on?

57
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,850
I shouldn't be just waiting here.

58
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,050
Ji Eun Tak!

59
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,620
What should we listen to? The newbie?

60
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,520
Sure.

61
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,200
Can I help you?

62
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,630
I'm PD Ji Eun Tak's boyfriend.

63
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,790
I'm her fiance, to be exact. How about we get married this weekend?

64
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,200
Wow.

65
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,780
Oh, should we grab lunch first? Let's go.

66
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,000
Are we expecting someone?

67
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,670
Deok Hwa. You should properly greet him.

68
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,460
Oh, right. You think he won't recognize me because I aged too much?

69
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,850
No way.

70
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,970
Aunty, give me one spicy.

71
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,930
He's here.

72
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,010
What is this? With this formal feast and a couple.

73
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:23,040
- I get it. I get it. <br> - Yes, we're getting married.

74
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,910
Wow.

75
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,290
Do you prefer Saturday or Sunday?

76
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,300
Why are you acting this way?

77
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,070
Then do you prefer lunchtime or dinnertime?

78
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,940
I like Sunday dinner. Saturday is party day.

79
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,310
Why are you like this?

80
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,890
You're asking <i>me</i>? This way you won't go on a blind date. <br>With a chaebol. A handsome chaebol.

81
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,680
Above all, a younger chaebol.

82
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,390
What are you talking about?

83
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm the only one in the country to meet all the criteria. Don't worry. You're not my style.

84
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,420
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoo Deok Hwa.

85
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,710
Yes, I've heard a lot about you. I'm Ji Eun Tak.

86
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,970
Wow, he became the team leader, now.

87
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,270
Ji Eun Tak? That old letter, Ji Eun Tak? Who knows my building, Ji Eun Tak?

88
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,680
You still have a lot you don't know, huh?

89
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,810
- Enjoy your food. <br> - Thank you.

90
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,910
Do you know what my uncle is to marry—

91
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,300
A goblin. Doesn't everybody know one goblin?

92
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,940
- Of course. <br> - Amazing.

93
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,620
You know my building. You know my uncle. What is this?

94
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,400
Why am I the only one who doesn't know?

95
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,700
Here. Eat and grow up. You'll know when you grow up.

96
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,600
Me, too.

97
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,620
If you do a blind date...

98
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,540
I'll be a married lady soon.

99
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,420
<i>She said a married lady.</i>

100
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,720
Where do you live?

101
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
I told you you're not my style.

102
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,210
Do you like your job?

103
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,840
Uncle is getting married.

104
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,910
That's good news.

105
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,920
Yes. So I'm going to get married before he does.

106
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,630
That's even better news.

107
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,160
Right? I'll raise a lot of kids and I'll make sure to make a lot of siblings.

108
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,880
That's more than I could wish for. But Deok Hwa...

109
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,570
- You can't get married alone. <br> - I have a lot of girls.

110
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,040
Exactly. You can't have a lot in that matter.

111
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,530
Oh.

112
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,000
Was there anyone that your heart beat just by thinking of her?

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,040
Was there anyone who you teared up if you didn't see? Was there anyone

114
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,340
that you could die in exchange of?

115
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:49,100
Not yet. How about you? Have you thought about getting married?

116
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,700
- No. <br> - Why not?

117
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,170
Because I'm already married and have three kids. I married someone like that.

118
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,530
What? Really? Why didn't I know?

119
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,640
- Because I never told you. <br> - Why didn't you tell me?

120
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,750
Because you never asked.

121
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,740
You don't care about the world and people around you yet, right?

122
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:16,220
That's why I'm waiting for your questions. An adult's questions.

123
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:22,640
About the world. About the happiness and sadness of the people around you.

124
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:36,050
Thank you. Just wait for me a little more. I'll work hard to grow up.

125
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,000
I will.

126
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,210
Wow, how can you, without my consent, tell everybody?

127
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,140
Whoa! Keep your eyes on the road! A car on the left!

128
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,420
Why? Are you nervous?

129
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,050
No. Seeing you drive makes you look like a real adult... The line! The steering wheel!

130
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,470
- Hold on to the steering wheel! <br> - I see it all.

131
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,560
I know! I know! I'm just amazed!

132
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,890
It's my first time on the passenger side. Turn left.

133
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,670
- Oh, left turn. <br> - Left turn! Left! Left!

134
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,750
Seriously! Where are we going to?

135
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,140
Turn on the blinker when you turn. All the time!

You're pretty dandy, too, Mr. Kim Shin.

140
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,110
It's not a day or two (that I've been dandy).

141
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:05,390
Let's have the wedding with a bowl of sacred water. Mysteriously.

142
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,780

Is it a present?

146
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,620
It's a wedding watch.

147
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,800
He's got a pretty wrist. I'll take this one.

Then we will listen to the song and be back with the listener's story.

158
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,590
Cue.

159
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,420
What is this? There's no subject. Is it a love letter written at night?

160
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,650
What is it? I like love letters.

161
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,680
You must.

162
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,040

163
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,130
I knew the moment I saw your eyes, that you have been cherishing all the memories."

164
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,370
Use this story. It's the PD's power. I will be going out for a while.

165
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,260

<i>With a face that we can meet without an excuse.</i>

<i>In this world, the only earnest name.</i>

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,840
<i>A relationship where we run to greet each other if we meet by coincidence.</i>

170
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,520
<i>A person whose answer is always right.</i>

171
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,540
<i>I pray that we would meet like that.</i>

172
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,390
<i>It's enough since I have seen your face.</i>

173
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:39,820
<i>Sometimes, Kim Woo Bin. Sometimes, Wang Yeo.</i>

174
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,960
<i>I hope... for a long time...</i>

175
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,980
<i>Goodbye..</i>

176
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,170
She didn't only move but sold the whole building?

177
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,560
Yes. Last week. Miss, you're from the rooftop, right?

178
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,950
I even bought it with your lease. I heard you work in a broadcasting station.

179
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,540
Ah, yes. For now I am in a rush, I will see you next time.

180
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:26,030
<i>Part-timer. I am leaving. Be well. Don't cry.</i>

181
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:31,920
<i>Eat a big bite of something. To you who lost your parents when you were little and all alone,</i>

182
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,360
<i>I wish I was a comfort even for a while.</i>

183
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,280
<i>I leave my stubborn Orabeoni in your care. Live together happily for a long time.</i>

184
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,140
<i>Goodbye.</i>

185
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,610
She remembers everything.

186
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,560
Boss...

187
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,480
has left.

188
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,910
She remembers everything.

189
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,760
She protected those memories alone. She looked after me who had no memories of it.

190
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,830
She longed for her Orabeoni who was gone, so lonely like that.

191
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,450
But why do you think she left?

192
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,830
Because she could not forgive.

193
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,610
In this life... she chose not to see him again.

194
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:33,370
To Grim Reaper... there is no bigger punishment than that.

195
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,660
I will just count to 50 then go.

196
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,490
One.

197
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,390
Two.

198
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,270
Forty-seven.

199
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,620
Forty-eight.

200
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,680
Forty-nine.

201
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,090
<i>One.</i>

202
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:28,070
♫<i> I don’t know why my tears keep falling when I look at you </i>♫

203

♫<i> I don’t know why my tears keep falling when I look at you </i>♫

204
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:35,380
Two.

205
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,200
Three.

206
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,250
♫ <i>Were you coming back to me? </i>♫

207
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,120
News... I won't let it come to you.

208
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,480
In this life...

209
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,920
I won't be able to see you again.

210
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,230
♫<i> I could feel that we are meant to be </i>♫

211
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,110
Just once...

212

♫ <i> Don’t leave my side </i>♫

221
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,430

222
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,830
<i>The time I heard of her news...</i>

223
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,770
<i>was a long time after that.</i>

224
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,560
I touched these vulgar things for you, how about eating it?

225
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,690
Even if the apple is shaped like a rabbit?

226
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,060
Sunny...

227
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,820
left.

228
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,350
That woman...

229
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,880
till the end...

230
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,510
goes well as always.

231
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,330
After you became like that, just in case, I held on to it not knowing what to do.

232
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,620
I should have returned this to you.

233
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,120
I'm sorry it took so long.

234
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,120
It wasn't mine from the beginning.

235
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,420
It was your grudge, sin and longing. I think it's right for you to have it.

236
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,760
- But still, can I?<br>- Yeah.

237
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,640
If you eat this.

238
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,650
And also, thank you.

239
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,190
The ancestral tablet in the temple, the 9 years that I was gone

240
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,190
you lit it every year.

241
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,920
<i>I don't know if I have the right to pay tribute to them,</i>

242
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,620
but I want to face my sins.

243
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,590
I wish someone would tell us...

244
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,330
"It's enough."

245
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,180
"It's enough now."

246
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,660
I heard you wanted to see me.

247
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,680
I wanted to let you know of a secret.

248
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,990
A secret?

249
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,500
If you commit a huge crime, you would become a grim reaper.

250
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,590
What that sin is.

251
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,810
The great sin that we committed is the sin of throwing out our own lives.

252
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:10,830
Those who take their own lives are made into grim reapers.

253
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,050
Leading the ones to death, living as

254
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,530
an existence who's not living, nor dead.

255
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,220
What could be the reason?

256
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,880
One without a name, one without memories.

257
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,950
Needs a house,

258
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:35,130
needs something to eat, what do you think the reason is?

259
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,550
As I was looking for answers to those questions and suddenly one day

260
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,950
the things that we gave up on,

261
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,050
name, the life that we threw away,

262
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,440
would we want them back one day?

263
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,730
If we want life earnestly, won't our punishment end?

264
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,730
I know the reason why you are avoiding me.

265
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,790
Nine years ago, I had a hunch that you met Park Joong Hun.

266
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:17,020
That's why you know who I am and who you are.

267
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,640
And so...

268
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,510
I wanted to apologize. I borrowed your hands

269
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,770
and had a death that shouldn't have. I regret it.

270
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,460
And also... I ask for forgiveness.

271
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,450
So forget it all. Forget them and live.

272
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:56,410
See off the deceased for the last time, live as you atone.

273
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,610
I hope

274
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,600
you can forgive yourself, also.

275
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,840
The thing that God hopes for us is to forgive ourselves.

276
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,160
And realize an ardent life.

277
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,260
Aunt, eat.

278
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,740
Where are you going late at night?

279
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,890
The soup will get cold. Eat it.

280
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,120
Did you get yourself a man?

281
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,540
Oh my. You can't become a single mom like your mother.

282
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,200
Aunt, why do you have to say that?

283
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,500
Until when are you going to stay here?

284
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,210
I already set the table enough for you. You are now a ghost.

285
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,160
- It's not good to be wandering around too much.<br>- Where are you looking at with those eyes?

286
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,290
Hey.

287
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,840
I can't go like this. Since it's so unfair.

288
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,360
If I had that bankbook. If only you didn't take that bankbook!

289
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,530
I wouldn't have been like this on the streets!

290
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,090
Aunt, seriously, why are you like this? Must you be like this even in death?

291
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:27,090
You are answering back because you haven't been hit lately, huh?

292
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,750
I ough to... !

293
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,190
Ahjumma, whom are you laying your hands on right now? <br>Do you know how much I cherish that child?

294
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,650
I ought to... break your wrist?

295
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,070
Hey! What are you? What is this crazy bitch doing?

296
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,340
To a sunbae, "Crazy?" This won't do.

297
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,360
Ahjumma, you need to come with me.

298
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,250
Come with me. It's because I'm lonely.

299
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,050
I have good chemistry with bad wenches.

300
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,750
Let go. Won't you let go? Do you know this bitch?

301
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,350
- Unni. <br>- I think I found my travel buddy.

302
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:08,060
She will be a good sparring opponent on the lonely afterlife road.

303
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,960
You're going?

304
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,610
It's about time.

305
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,320
I'm thankful for all this time. Live well with the Goblin, girl.

306
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,080
Come, Ahjumma. Let's go.

307
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,020
Wait.

308
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,110
Aunt, thank you for raising me.

309
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:37,220
In the next life, let's meet with good fate.

310
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,480
Don't be funny! Why would I see you again?

311
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,580
Let go! Aren't you letting go? Let go!

312
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,520
Let go! Let go!

313
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,610
Welcome.

314
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,120
You're still doing it alone as usual. Where's Mr. Goblin?

315
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,320
I don't know. He said he's getting sacred water or something.

316
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,290
I asked to see you because I wanted to give you something.

317
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,700
Perhaps... did a name card arrive?

318
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,090
No. Not that.

319
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,840
So it's not. That startled me.

320
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,470
Are you worried that a name card might come?

321
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,840
Rather than being worried, I'm curious.

322
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,960
How my fate has changed.

323
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,650
Your fate has so many variables.

324
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,970
I know.

325
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,260
My birthmark is gone, the sword is pulled out,

326
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,500
and so I have lived with no scratches these past 9 years.

327
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:03,260
But... the truth that I am a Miscellaneous Omitted Person hasn't changed.

328
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:10,270
I was almost not born. I've lost someone I love from death.

329
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:16,750
At the very least, the one who is before me is a Grim Reaper.

330
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:22,210
And more than that, a human dies someday.

331
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,280
That's why life is more beautiful.

332
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:36,760
That's why, after my memories returned... <br>the first thought I had was to live as if this was my last day.

333
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:44,890
If today is the last, then this memory would be the last memory of the one I love.

334
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:53,260
So, I should try hard to live and love every moment.

335
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,540
Your life is already beautiful, know that.

336
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,710
What is it that you'll be giving me?

337
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,080
Here.

338
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,030
Wow!

339
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,540
Congratulations on your wedding, Goblin's bride.

340
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,860
Thank you.

341
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:53,010
Until death splits us apart. All of your words, whatever they are.

342
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,000
Me, too.

343
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,470
Even if death splits us apart. All your words, whatever they are, me, too.

344
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,770
- That must be delicious. <br>- It's cooked well?

345
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,810
Should we do a few more?

346
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,500
Between 7 to 9 degrees is best for champagne.

347
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,620
Uncle down the hall!

348
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,810
I think I'm drunk without even drinking.

349
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,280
How can you be drunk already?

350
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,260
- One shot!<br>- What's with you, too?

351
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,560
Are you alright? You don't look too good.

352
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,090
I'm okay--

353
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:06,020
Okay. I got it to 7 degrees.

354
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,790
Would you like a glass?

355
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,940
If you would give...

356
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,220
CEO Kim! CEO Kim!

357
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,790
You should be careful!

358
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,180
You are all too careless and naive.

359
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,040
What is this? Why does this sound familiar?

360
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,550
Sing. Sing.

361
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,200
Sing.

362
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,120
No, how could I sing? I can't sing!

363
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,020
♬ In the middle of these many people

364
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:50,310

365
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:55,400
♬ In the middle of this vast world

366
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,710
Altogether.

367
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:03,350
♬ Meeting you is a joy to me as well

368
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:10,260
♬ In the middle of all these people

369
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,850
I'm sleepy.

370
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,860
Good night.

371
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,180
I love you.

372
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,470
♬ <i> It's a beautiful life </i> ♬

373
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:54,280
<i>It's the last song. I hope everyone is happy.</i>

374
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,670
Okay. You worked hard.

375
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,050
You worked hard.

376
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,670
Today's broadcast was really crazy.

377
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:06,500
We were right on time, the song selection was unbelievable, the message board from the listener's reaction was good, too.

378
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,430
It's rarely this perfect.

379
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,680
You're going to make me feel arrogant.

380
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,780
Then... I will go off work after my meeting with the guest.

381
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,880
Okay.

382
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,660
- Work hard.<br>- Yeah. See you tomorrow.

383
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,820
♬ <i>It's a beautiful life. Beautiful day</i> ♬

384
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,280
♬ <i>I would live in your memory</i> ♬

385
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:35,200
♬ <i>Beautiful life. Beautiful day</i> ♬

386
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,610
It seems like the kindergarten bus will be in an accident.

387
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,280
This seems to be the driver.

388
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,830
Now... I really think that this job is really a punishment.

389
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,540
I will take this call.

390
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,300
Mister.

391
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,740
Sunbaenim, it's from the registration team.

392
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,830
They said we should get rid of the name cards received for today.

393
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,820
The children's fate has been changed.

394
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,630
Is that so?

395
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,660
Why did it change?

396
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,090
Because of the death of a name card that doesn't come in.

397
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,670
Is there also a death where a name card does not come?

398
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,890
What is that?

399
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,560
A death that can't be calculated.

400
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,480
<i>A sacrifice.</i>

401
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,100
Where are you? Why aren't you coming? It's a dangerous world.

402
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,770
Do you know what time it is?

403
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,270
It's 4 in the afternoon and I am on my way to a meeting.

404
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,180
Wait. I will turn right.

405
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,100
Right turn is on the right.

406
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,820
Ah, seriously.

407
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,870
<i>Hello? Eun Tak.</i>

408
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,010
Ji Eun Tak.

409
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,550
The kindergarten bus...

410
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,430
If I avoid it then those kiddos...

411
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,280
What? I can't hear you well. What happened?

412
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,540
I must be crazy. What am I doing now?

413
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,860
<i>Now that I think about it, it was a perfect day.</i>

414
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:05,530
<i>When I woke up, I was in his embrace.</i>

415
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:12,260
<i>I made the fried egg perfectly, too. It was a satisfactorily live broadcast.</i>

416
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:19,960
<i>All of those perfections must have been to lead me to this moment.</i>

417
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,480
<i>So, I won't be late.</i>

418
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,680
Hello? Where are you?

419
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,900
Ji Eun Tak, where are you?

420
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,430
<i>It wouldn't have worked if I was late for a minute or second.</i>

421
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,580
<i>This was my destiny.</i>

422
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,420
<i>Good night.</i>

423
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,120
<i>I love you.</i>

424
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,320
I do, too.

425
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,890
<i>A human's sacrifice</i>

426
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:28,680
<i>is a domain that God cannot calculate and forsee.</i>

427
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,090
That is a moment's instinct

428
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,920
and wholly a human's decision.

429
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:44,320
It's something only a human can decide on.

430
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,350
<i>Ji Eun Tak. 29 years old. Accident.</i>

431
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:59,620
Late... A name card has arrived.

432
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:09,550
To an awfully mean God's question, you gave an awfully sad answer,

433
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,210
Miscellaneous Omitted Person.

434
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:39,510
Born on September 10th, 1998. 29 years old.

435
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,590
Ji Eun Tak...

436
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:51,350
It's... you, right?

437
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:06,830
I was saying, "What am I doing?" but I was still doing it.

438
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:15,220
I was... really scared, Mister.

439
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:21,390
<i>This afternoon, a truck that was parked on the side, the brake got loose and ran down the road</i>

440
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,870
<i>and killed a woman in her twenties.</i>

441
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:29,270
That car must have absorbed all the shock from the front. Oh no!

442
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:34,930
Wasn't it an angel? People like that I believe are angels.

443
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:40,090
If it wasn't for her, a lot more people would have died.

444
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,710
So this is what Mr. Grim Reaper's workplace looks like.

445
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,930
It's really nice.

446
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:58,550
Mister, I have something I'm curious about. I heard that a person has 4 lives.

447
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:07,020
Which life did I live? You can tell that to a deceased, can't you?

448
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,400
You... lived the first life.

449
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,210
That's a relief.

450
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,940
I have three left.

451
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:41,310
I will come with the tea. Go ahead and talk.

452
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,720
Do you...

453
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,670
remember what I said last time?

454
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:21,170
The person left... should live more diligently.

455
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:27,160
You'll cry from time to time, but you should laugh more

456
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,480
and energetically.

457
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,180
That is manners for the love received.

458
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:50,100
How could... How could you do this to me...

459
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,420
I'm sorry.

460
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,460
I'm really sorry.

461
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,900
Look at me. Let me see your face.

462
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:16,910
♬ <i> Just like I used to be </i>♬

463
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:23,180
Mister, you haven't granted one of the three wishes I had.

464
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:28,050
Can't you grant it to me now?

465
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:36,190
Don't hurt for a long time. I will come to meet you again so wait well.

466
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:42,320
Don't make it rain too much, since the citizens would be uncomfortable.

467
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:47,640
You said one but why are you saying three? How will I live without you?

468
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,550
I will be gone just for a little bit.

469
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,440
I promise.

470
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,710
This time... I will come.

471
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,050
I will... find you.

472
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:12,990
In the next life, I will be born full of life and stay for a long, long time by your side.

473
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:19,610
I will pester them when I go up there so that I can do that.

474
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:27,160
♬ <i> When you feel so lonely </i> ♬

475
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,120
♬ <i> I'll be here </i> ♬

476
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:36,540
When everyone is gone, please check on him once in a while.

477
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:42,890
♬ <i> When you feel so lonely </i> ♬

478
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:50,340
It's the oblivion tea. It will make you forget the memories of this life.

479
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,680
♬ <i> Here for you </i> ♬

480
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,020
The tea... I won't drink it.

481
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,880
Now I... think I need to go.

482
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,470
♬ <i> Above the clouds like all the birds </i> ♬

483
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:17,870
I will hurry and come. I will run there...

484
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,650
♬ <i> To let you feel </i> ♬

485
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,110
And I will run back.

486
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:27,240
♬ <i> Still here </i> ♬

487
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:34,030
You have to come back. Even if it takes 100 years, even if it takes 200 years, I will be waiting.

488
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:41,340
You must.

489
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:52,270
♬ <i> You're my whole life and my whole heart </i> ♬

490
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,190

00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:19,640
<i>In this world with no guardian god, Miscellaneous Omitted Person,</i>

513
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,290
<i>summoned the guardian god back and left.</i>

514
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,220
<i>A guardian god so lonely and radiant.</i>

515
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,680
Her mom...

516
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,020
she must have met her.

517
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,660
What is that pin? Did you buy it yourself?

518
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,630
It's not me. It's my dad's taste.

519
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,390
Then you should wear it when your dad is here. Why wear it out?

520
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:01,930
I love my dad whether I see him or not,

521
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:05,320
so don't mind and shut up.

522
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:08,010
I don't even have a dad that would buy me a pin.

523
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,030
I don't know, that's why.

524
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,480
Hey... why take variety for a documentary (why take it so seriously)?

525
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,390
What are you looking at, Ahjumma?

526
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,740
Kids these days are scary.

527
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,850
What is she saying?

528
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,430
Child...

529
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,210
I know that everyone is like that at your age.

530
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,400
But at your age,

531
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,780
you don't have to be like that.

532
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:37,770
It's just that you guys are lovable,

533
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,740
I was looking, thinking, "How could they be so lovable?"

534
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,270
I'm sorry.

535
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,550
I'm sorry.

536
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,600
- Should I give you more fish cakes? <br> - Yes.

00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:29,080
Your long punishment... has ended.

570
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,750
- Only one? <br> - Yes.

571
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,810
Finally a period to this long punishment.

572
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:52,920
Congratulations. I hope

573
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,910
you go peacefully.

574
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,980
I have troubled you a lot.

575
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,010
I appreciate it.

576
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,280
Now there won't be a need to dry clean.

577
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:04,680
<i>[Kim Seon. 68 years old.]</i>

578
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:10,220
She said... she wouldn't let me hear her news.

579
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,020
Now I hear news about you.

580
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,690
It's my last time leaving for work.

581
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,720
Go well.

582
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,050
Stay well.

583
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,000
In any time, in whatever appearance...

584
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,020
be happy.

585
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:02,530
All this time, I lived well.

586
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,940
Don't make it rain.

587
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,390
Don't worry.

588
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:10,160
Separation is my long-time job.

589
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,100
When the laundry is done

590
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,610
make sure you hang them.

591
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,890
When you're done, come to the tea house.

592
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,760
I am going to violate the rules once more.

593
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,330
Since I'm leaving anyway.

594
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,210
You haven't aged a bit.

595
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,650
You are handsome as always.

596
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,110
Have you been well?

597
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:07,350
I thought I won't hear news about you.

598
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,070
I forgot...

599
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:14,140
the man I dated was a grim reaper.

600
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,060
This news...

601
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,740
I didn't know it would reach you.

602
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,120
I missed you.

603
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:23,560
I knew it.

604
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:46,160
I wanted to put it on you right just once.

605
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,580
Because I put it on you so harshly...

606
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:50,840
I was sorry.

607
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,100
I missed you a lot.

608
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,420
I knew you would.

609
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:03,570
Sunny... you are

610
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:06,390
the last deceased that I will be handing over.

611
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:09,190
I see.

612
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:12,560
Then... what's next?

613
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,360
What happens to us?

614
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,280
Is this a happy ending for us?

615
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:21,330
Sunny...

616
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:24,730
this is your third life.

617
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:27,060
What about you?

618
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,180
I'm not sure.

619
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,000
This...

620
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,830
could possibly be the last.

621
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:43,170
Your brother is here. Outside.

622
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,790
As usual, you don't even care about your brother.

623
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,420
Like this...

624
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,980
I could see you before I go.

625
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,650
I feel good.

626
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,150
It's all thanks to having met a good friend.

627
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:07,990
I'm sorry for going first and leaving you behind.

628
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:10,280
Please stay healthy, Orabeoni.

629
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,780
Some day...

630
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,670
let's meet again.

631
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:19,140
Be happy, my ugly.

632
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,050
<i>My sister,</i>

633
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,890
<i>my friend,</i>

634
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:27,680
<i>and my bride, too,</i>

635
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,550
<i>have left</i>.

636
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,500
<i>And as always...</i>

637
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:42,180
<i>I am left all alone.</i>

638
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,050
Cheer up.

639
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,480
Do you know why there are two sandwiches?

640
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,900
It's for sharing. Don't refuse and just accept it.

641
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,600
In this vast world

642
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:28,110
there's got to be a place to work for us. Here.

643
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:35,410
How frustrating could it be for a young man like you.

644
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:37,250
But then, let's have strength.

645
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,960
A life that shines late,

646
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:43,130
won't there be one?

647
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,340
<i>In anyone's life</i>

648
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,590
<i>there is a time when God stops by.</i>

649
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:57,260
<i>When you are drifting apart from the world</i>

650
01:01:57,270 --> 01:02:01,280
<i>if someone pushed your back towards the world.</i>

651
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:06,800
<i>That is... the moment that God has stopped by in your life.</i>

652
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,050
<i>Then I will be going first.</i>

653
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:12,940
Look here, Mr. Kim.

654
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:16,390
Not there, but go this way.

655
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:19,960
There will be someone who needs your help.

656
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:23,450
It's the payment for the sandwich.

657
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,310
Chairman, if you look at it, would you know?

658
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:40,550
Yes. First, I know that it is broken.

659
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:42,910
Do you want me to look at it?

660
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,780
Would you know if you look at it?

661
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,970
I've been working on cars for about 20 years.

662
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,740
It would be faster if you contact your insurance company. Why are you here like this?

663
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,220
Have you called the insurance company?

664
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:03,960
Since you jumped right in I wasn't able to think about it. I will call right away.

665
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:10,440
I guess... I was meant to meet a new fate.

666
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:16,110
Fate? You are such a romanticist, elder.

667
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:20,590
Yes, I am a bit on that side.

668
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:26,330
<i>Kim Seon. Wang Yeo.</i>

669
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:34,390
<i>That night, as I sent a lantern... in a far away life, my sister...</i>

670
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:37,950
<i>in a far away life, my king...</i>

671
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:41,080
<i>I prayed that they would meet again in the after life.</i>

672
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:48,110
<i>And in that life that they meet again, they would be happy.</i>

673
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:50,060
<i>I prayed for that.</i>

674
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,420
What is this?

675
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:01,650
When you suppress the criminal, do it at once. When you put on the handcuff, do it ruthlessly. When you read them their Miranda Rights, say them clearly.

676
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:05,160
You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions...

677
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,630
I asked what are you doing? Is it so hard to understand?

678
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:10,780
You asked to show a demonstration on how to arrest a criminal.

679
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:15,010
No... that... I asked you to show me, not do it to me.

680
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:17,920
The criminal is over there! There!

681
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:23,550
The criminal is her? Well, you look like a criminal.

682
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:25,580
I'm sorry.

683
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,810
Can't you see right away that I am the detective?

684
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:34,050
The moment I saw, even when I looked again... you look like a criminal the more I look at you.

685
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:37,750
This person, seriously. Where do you see me as a criminal?

686
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:41,370
Did I steal your heart or something?

687
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:45,570
You look like a lady at the gambling place. From head to toe.

688
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:49,400
Because I'm the gambling lady, I'm undercover right now.

689
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,670
Undercover!

690
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:54,640
This is a historical play with the background of 2016 so...

691
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:59,250
Never mind. Director, what is this person?

692
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:01,650
Why is he doing this to me?

693
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:03,260
I didn't introduce you two.

694
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:06,100
He is a homicide detective that will give us advice.

695
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,390
I am Lee Hyeok from Gangnam Station.

696
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,520
Hyeok? Amazing.

697
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,420
I can hear you.

698
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:27,650
Don't misunderstand. I am an actress.

699
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:34,240
We came to film but the staff didn't reserve a room so I had no choice but to come here.

700
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,650
No choice.

701
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,230
I am her stylist.

702
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:46,900
There's only one room left.

703
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:53,390
How can they always have only one room left all the time?

704
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:55,120
We can't help it.

705
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,130
Please give us that room.

706
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:59,310
Please hurry and give it to us.

707
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:03,440
Even if we go out, only our legs would get tired.

708
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,310
When legs get tired, they get thick.

709
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:10,430
We need to sleep early so that my skin tomorrow would be stable.

710
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,810
No, how could they not get a room for an actress?

711
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:17,350
I didn't ask. Here, the key.

712
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:20,750
Lead the way... stylist.

713
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,950
Do you have a room?

714
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:28,570
Aigoo. What to do? We have only one room.

715
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:32,280
Pretend you didn't hear.

716
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,280
I didn't hear it.

717
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:41,010
So... what are we?

718
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,740
What?

719
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:51,470
No... well... let's date, let's meet, I like you... when are you going to do that?

720
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:54,350
Aren't you going to do that?

721
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:56,250
Do I have to do that first?

722
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:59,220
Then should I do it first? I'm an actress.

723
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,750
It's already infuriating that I liked you first.

724
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,610
Who said that? That you liked me first?

725
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:06,680
Everyone says... that I was the first one to like you. Isn't that the case?<br>- No.

726
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,240
- What is?<br>- I was the first to like you.

727
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:14,410
This is my repor-no, my sincerity.

728
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:22,550
If you were even a bit late, I would have been the first one to like you.

729
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,640
Give me your hand.

What is this?

734
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,550
Just think of it as something like a handcuff.

735
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:48,070
Since you just stole my heart.

736
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:51,990
You see the lion(saja) here. I heard your nickname was violent grim reaper(saja)?

737
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:55,050
Isn't this a bribe?

Are you going out, My Lord?

746
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:33,650
I want to go for a walk.

747
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:35,980
You should avoid the big road.

748
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:40,280
There are students from Korea who came for a vacation so it's a bit noisy.

749
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:44,050
- I will be back.<br>- Yes, My Lord.

750
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,790

I give one vote that there is one.

754
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:37,660
Sad love.

755

Mister, you know who I am, right?

756
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:25,490
My first and last... Goblin's bride.
