00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,810
Did you get up?

174
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:00,050
In front of my eyes, he just woke up. He's alive. <br>He had excessive blood loss, but the body color was good.

175
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,530
The list of names just burned up. Is this a possible event?

176
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,940
It is possible, if that's the Goblin's fire.

177
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,930
This must be yours.

178
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,880
What is this?

179
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,420
The Goblin's apology.

180
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,020
Apology?

181
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,790
It's socks...

182
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:32,620
Is apologizing in advance enough? You caused the trouble, so why does the Grim Reaper have to do the overtime? How dare you burn our list?

183
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:38,000
Has living forever made you go blind? The tragic fate of the two of you is unfortunate...

184
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,260
but that doesn't mean you can meddle with a human's life, you senseless goblin!

185
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,990
I just... wanted someone to see it.

186
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,960
It would be good if the deity saw it.

187
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,560
It would be better if Eun Tak saw it.

188
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,790
If you say it like that, what does that make me?

189
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,460
I shouldn't have said anything.

190
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,270
I should've just let the Miscellaneously Omitted person pull out the sword.

191
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,670
You're right. That would've been better.

192
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,090
In this world...

193
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:28,260
there are many weird beings that are unexplainable with words.

194
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,640
At times, they're closer to us than we think.

195
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,880
I think that you already had an idea.

196
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,490
<i>Yoo Jae Shin!</i>

197
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,330
<i>Sorry.</i>

198
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,960
<i>Eh-hey!</i>

199
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:56,210
One man who doesn't age, I know one.

200
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:56,950
Yeah?

201
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,420
The passport I made, places I prepared in Nice. Making me stay by Deok Hwa's side...

202
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,250
I believe that you gave me these jobs to recognize that being on my own.

203
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:15,500
Have you by chance spoken of that existence to anyone?

204
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,420
There is no one.

205
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:22,080
Actually, he is the one who picked you.

206
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,680
He made a boy from a back alley without a dream

207
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,750
take the GED, have a dream,

208
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,980
enrolled him in a university. Who do you think is that faceless helper?

209
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,750
Remember. The person's real name is...

210
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,920
Kim as his last name, Chinese character 'Shin' which means 'believe' as his name.

211
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,080
Hey, Kim Shin. The Supermoon and the fog, was you. Right, Uncle?

212
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,980
Why are you creating such a mess to find a high school girl?

213
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,580
I'm really scared that NASA would actually take you away.

214
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,600
Did you drink alcohol?

215
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,590
Yesterday, I drank.

216
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,860
Now, I'm sober.

217
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,290
Anyways, if I do find her, what would you do for me, Uncle? Will you give me a credit card?

218
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,170
If I can't find her, how would you?

219
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:32,220
She wouldn't have gone far. She has no money. She has to be somewhere in Korea where you can go by bus. I have my ways.

220
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,460
<i>Welcome.</i>

221
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,710

Hello.

00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,380
Yes, wait a moment, please.

224
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,810
Wait a moment. Yes.

00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,660

236
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,640
Crazy bastard.

237
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,020
<i>Not today. Today, I'll just laugh with you.</i>

<i>First snow?</i>

240
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,030
<i>You'll need a broom then.</i>

241
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,830
When the first snow comes.<i></i>

242
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,160
There's too much snow.

243
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,230
Let's go home.

244
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,560
You shouldn't stay alone like this.

245
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,500
I don't have a home.

246
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:35,150
None of the places I thought were my home, was actually my home.

247
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,520
People just kept me close. Some because of insurance money

248
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,550
and some because they wanted to die.

249
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,600
I know it all now. I'm the tool to end the Goblin's immortality.

250
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,950
I missed the opportunity to tell you.

251
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,430
Because I missed the opportunity, I was glad.

252
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,660
If possible, until the moment of death,

253
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,100
I was going to let myself miss every opportunity.

254
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,650
But I shouldn't have done that.

255
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,520
The blood of thousands is on this sword.

256
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,180
The weight of a person's life,

257
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,930
it wasn't for me to judge.

258
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,200
So take this sword out. I ask of you.

259
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,010
No.

260
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,230
I don't want to. I don't want to even if I die.

261
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,980
So don't look for me. Don't look for me

262
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,230
and let's live as though we don't know each other.

263
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,700
Go far away from me,

264
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,590
and just live for a very, very long time, Mr. Kim Shin.

265
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,310
Do you understand?

266
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,150
Don't appear again.

267
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,890

268
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,040

You did well on the exam.

290
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,390
You call this an excuse...

291
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,330
I was happy to have at least this as an excuse.

292
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,910
Even like this,

293
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,680
an excuse that I can come see you.

294
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,580
What do you want to do after seeing me?

295
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,130
What do you want to do with that excuse?

296
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:18,570
Live together or die together?

297
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,090
If you appear before me again,

298
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,000
didn't I tell you that I would kill you or not?

299
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,190
Fine, come here.

300
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,730
I will pull out the sword.

301
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,450
If that is what you wish so badly then I will pull it out for you.

302
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,160
Come here now.

303
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,620
This man, til the end.

304
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,650
Don't.

305
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:12,630
Do it. You have to do it.

306
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,600
Let go! Let go!

307
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,980
Let go! Let go, I said!

308
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,500
It was from that moment.

309
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,730
In the hotel, when you appeared,

310
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,930
it was from that moment.

311
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,150
<i>Ahjussi, do you love me?</i>

312
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,060

<i>I love you.</i>

315
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,240
So... did you really love me?

316
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,900
No?

317
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,640
You didn't do even that?

318
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,540
I'm scared.

319
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,100
I'm so scared.

320
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,470
So, I wish...

321
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,230
you would keep telling me that you need me.

322
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,470
I wish you would ask me to do that as well.

323
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,260
A permission that's like an excuse,

324
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,500
I wish I had it.

325
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,020
With that excuse, I...

326
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,640
I wish I could stay alive.

327
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,330

He's asking to have it done within an hour.

Why isn't Chief Kim coming?

- You didn't meet her?<br>- I met her.

344
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:29,090
- But she's not coming.<br>- What on earth happened?

345
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:32,210
It's my first time waiting for a document to be processed.

346
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,690
Miscellaneously Omitted person's register is out.

347
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,120
Are you sure it's Eun Tak's?

348
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,800
- It's empty. <br>- It's there. The writing.

349
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,110
What on earth is this situation?

350
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,170
As if she's being pushed to her death.

351
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,420
I'm not the one who's doing that.

352
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,140
- And I'm sure you're not either.<br>- It must be me.

353
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,490
I have to die for her to live.

354
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:06,010
If I live then she dies.

355
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,630
That is the fate of that child and me.

356
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,140
This is the punishment that was bestowed to me.

357
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,970
This was God's true will.

358
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,380
Don't say something so weak. Even if it was God's will,

359
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,200
it is not mine.

360
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,030
You are also the same.

361
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,460
One hour from now, the time of death. You should hurry.

362
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,720
<i>The phone is turned off.</i>

363
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,350
<i>This person is not able to be reached at this time.<i></i></i>

364
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,560
<i>Death will constantly come before that child.</i>

365
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,170
<i>She probably has encountered it several times.</i>

366
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,560
<i>She will face more in the future.</i>

367
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:26,270
<i>More times than the accidents now and more severe.</i>

368
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,430
<i>It's the first snow, Mister!</i>

369
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:12,640
<i>But why is the first snow so early? It's so fascinating.</i>

370
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,540
<i>I wish you would continue to need me.</i>

371
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:35,520
<i>I wish you would ask that of me.</i>

372
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,040
<i>I wish I could use</i>

373
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,470
<i>permission as an excuse.</i>

374
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,970
I need you.

375
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,690
That's all I ask of you.

376
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,540
I love you.

377
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:18,140
â™¬ <i>See you never gone away </i> â™¬

378
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,480
â™¬ <i> It will be better someday </i> â™¬

379
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,130
â™¬ <i> Never far away </i> â™¬

380
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,160
Ji Eun Tak, have you come to your senses?

381
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,580
This is the hospital.

382
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,450
You showed symptoms of hypothermia and a concussion.

383
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:20,190
It's a relief that you're okay. If you were even a little bit late, <br>your condition would've become dangerous.

384
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,300
Ah.

385
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,070
How long have I been in this state?

386
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:27,090
A day and a half.

387
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,770
Ah.

388
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:37,000
Then, what about the hospital fee?

389
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,810
Ah. You don't need to worry about that.

390
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,720
But what is your relationship with the CEO of the Cheon Woo Group?

391
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,440
The Chairman himself came in to admit you into the hospital. <br>The entire hospital was in an uproar.

392
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,020
If you want, you can be discharged.

393
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,590
I recommend staying here for your safety--

394
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,470
I'm sorry, but

395
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,360
by chance, does anyone have a match or lighter...

396
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,850
Pardon?

397
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:52,140
â™¬ <i> How can I care for you </i> â™¬

398
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:08,720
â™¬ <i> Please touch my heart just once </i> â™¬

399
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:16,460
â™¬ <i> It feels so cold </i> â™¬

400
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,250
â™¬ <i> I'm standing underneath </i> â™¬

401
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:26,910
â™¬ <i> A sky colder than winter </i> â™¬

402
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:30,760
â™¬ <i> My tears are frozen</i> â™¬

403
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:37,740
â™¬ <i> Quietly call me who's hurting</i> â™¬

404
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,660
â™¬ <i> My name that you have called many times </i> â™¬

405
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,350
â™¬ <i> Going back to eternity to see you one day </i> â™¬

406
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:54,310
â™¬ <i> No, even if I get to see you for a minute </i> â™¬

407
00:45:54,310 --> 00:46:00,210
â™¬ <i>If I can do that, I will endure it </i> â™¬

408
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:09,390
â™¬ <i> If you are standing at the end of my long wait</i> â™¬

409
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:16,150
â™¬ <i> Memories of you that seemed like</i> â™¬

410
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,660
â™¬ <i> a painting</i> â™¬

411
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:26,930
â™¬ <i> A day that is like a present that I was longing for</i> â™¬

412
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:30,740
â™¬ <i> Crossing over such a long time </i> â™¬

413
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,180
â™¬ <i> I will wait</i> â™¬

414
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:40,020
â™¬ <i> You who was the first snow in my heart</i> â™¬

415
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,560
â™¬ <i> I will always</i> â™¬

416
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,430
You should've told me you were leaving...

417
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,360
I thought you weren't coming back so I--

418
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,170
I came early and waited.

419
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,540
Who told you to come early? You should come when I blow out the candle.

420
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:09,440
You should've come there. You should've appeared in front of my eyes.

421
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,040
I came here to hold your hand.

422
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,950
I don't know. Whatever.

423
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,440
Me, too.

424
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,800
What?

425
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:10,000
If you don't know, never mind.

426
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,560
I know it though.

427
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,720
Then that's good.

428
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,750
I... have something to confess.

429
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,720
I can't see anything else about you, Mister.

430
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,800
You're tall, your clothes look expensive, and your eyes are amazing.

431
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,790
That's all I see. So,

432
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:54,600
I can't pull out the sword for you anymore.

433
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,700
I won't pull it out, even if you smile. In my eyes,

434
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,280
you're still really pretty.

435
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,260
â™¬ <i> It's a beautiful life </i> â™¬

436
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:29,770
â™¬ <i>Iâ€™ll be by your side</i> â™¬

437
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:33,000
â™¬ <i> It's a beautiful life </i> â™¬

438
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,250
â™¬ <i>Iâ€™ll stand behind you</i> â™¬

439
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:43,070
â™¬ <i>It's a beautiful life</i> â™¬<br>â™¬ <i>Beautiful day</i> â™¬

440
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:47,520
â™¬ <i>I would live in your memory</i> â™¬

441
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,450
â™¬ <i>Beautiful life</i> â™¬<br>â™¬ <i>Beautiful day</i> â™¬

442
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:56,300
â™¬ <i>Stay with me</i> â™¬

443
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:04,680
â™¬ <i>Beautiful my love</i> â™¬<br>â™¬ <i>Beautiful your heart</i> â™¬

444
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:12,070
â™¬ <i>It's a beautiful life</i> â™¬

445
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:19,290
â™¬ <i>It's a beautiful life</i> â™¬

446
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,390
â™¬ <i>Beautiful life</i> â™¬

447
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:31,070
His face is pale white and his lips are red.

448
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,810
He has black clothes

449
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:35,890
and is holding a black hat.

450
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,970
Oh my.

451
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:43,590
What is it? Why?

452
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:49,520
By chance, did you exchange your names? He's the Grim Reaper.

453
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,820
What did I tell you? I told you to be careful of men with black hats!

454
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:57,330
Do you make enough money to eat? Do you have any other customers besides me?

455
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:02,970
This woman, if you're wary of men, you can't date!

456
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:07,700
Grim Reaper? You have to be believable if you want to write me a talisman.

457
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:13,650
Then who is this man? He's very tall.

458
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:16,820
He seems like an older brother type, and has dinosaur-like features. (big features)

459
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:23,270
His voice... if you listen to him, you feel as though you're at the smallest cafe in the world...

460
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,920
Gong Yoo?<br> (the actor who plays the Goblin and also the main actor of Coffee Prince: hence, the word "cafe")

461
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,370
Then stay well.

462
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:36,070
Did you receive a sparkling item from somewhere?

463
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,390
- How did you know that?<br>- Throw it away.

464
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,630
You can't take things whose previous owners are unknown.

465
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:51,460
You don't know what's inside. There might be the owner's crimes, sins, desires, etc.

466
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:02,500
What crimes, what sins,

467
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,010
and what desires would be inside this?

468
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,700
But anyways that Kim Woo Bin or director is unreachable again.

469
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,120
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause you trouble.

470
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:28,360
Seriously, it's so pitiful that I always have to contact him first.

471
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,940
Right now?

472
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,120
Geez.

473
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,870
<i>- Are you busy?</i><br>- Yes. I'm so busy. I'm going insane.

474
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,460
<i>What are you doing right now?</i>

475
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:45,080
I'm trying to figure out my passcode. I want to turn it off, just in case it makes another sound.

476
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,360
<i>[The passcode failed. Try again in 30 seconds.]</i>

477
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,010
[What are you doing now?]

478
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,270
<i>Why aren't you trying to contact me again?</i>

479
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,850
That's...

480
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:07,470
Firstly, because I feel sorry about having erased your memory. Secondly...

481
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,980
<i> Who are you, and why are you so beautiful?</i>

482
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,330
I think I've started to have a crush on someone else!

483
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:26,410
I'm sorry. I am also feeling very confused about myself for being this way.

484
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,250
It seems like you've gotten a message.

485
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,660
<i>I miss you.</i>

486
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,970
- Me, too. <br>- Why am I constantly like this...

487
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,170
No, I haven't heard anything.

488
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:49,660
I didn't hear anything, I didn't hear anything, I didn't...

489
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,980
â™¬ Glory, glory, glory, hallelujah!

490
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,430
â™¬ Glory, glory, glory, hallelujah!

491
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,380
I know that you're there! Come out and show yourself!

492
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,350
How dare a lowly ghost try to harm a human being?

493
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:08,020
Come out! Not coming out, get lost!

494
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,070
If you don't obey me, I'll sing the song again!

495
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:15,120
â™¬ Glory, glory, hallelujah!

496
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,670
â™¬Glory, glory, hallelujah!

497
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:27,870
Why are you empty-handed? What about your luggage? Weren't you on your way home?

498
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:29,580
No, I was heading to my part-time work.

499
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:34,080
Since it's Christmas season, they pay really well. It's a relief I didn't get fired.

500
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,650
Let's finish up what we're supposed to do. Then, let's buy some beef and return home in glory.

501
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,220
Until when? Until when are you going to be here?

502
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,690
What do you mean by until when? Until all of February's snow at the ski resort melts.

503
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,120
You can go back home first.

504
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,500
What? February?!

505
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,520
President Yoo. Yes, President Yoo, it's me.

506
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,020
I was going to ask you to fire someone quickly using your vast connections.

507
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:01,550
Otherwise, I'm planning to quickly melt all the snow <br>at the ski resort. Which option shall I go for?

508
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:08,840
I'm back.

509
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,260
I'm sorry. You must have worried a lot.

510
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,470
- A little. He's the one who worried a lot.<br> - The one who found out about you was Deok Hwa.

511
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,160
And the one who got you here is me.

512
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:25,050
It's the first time to have a place to return to, so it feels weird.

513
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,690
It feels like this place is now really my home.

514
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,570
This girl's starting again... Every time you're asked something, there's a sad story!

515
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,960
It scares me to ask you to come back home.

516
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,790
Just wear it. You should come with me.

517
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:46,200
Where are you going to take my Mister? That's something I feel sensitive about.

518
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:51,670
<i>She said... 'my'!</i>

519
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:54,520
I can hear everything, you cheesy Goblin!

520
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,820
He's happy because you said "my."

521
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,260
<i>Follow me quickly! Leave Mr. Buckwheat there!</i>

522
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,030
But who are you submitting this report to?

523
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,460
Are you submitting it directly to...?

524
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,960
It doesn't go up that far. We were probably created to do all the tedious work.

525
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,950
Shouldn't the handwriting be the same?

526
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:27,190
I'll say that it's been written with my left hand, so just shut up and write!

527
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,870
But she was pretty. The owner of the chicken restaurant you visit frequently.

528
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:38,100
You met her? You didn't tell her anything useless by any chance, did you?

529
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,990
What I told her wasn't something that was particularly useful.

530
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:41,610
You told her? That I was a Reaper?

531
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,670
You told her, too! That I would disappear to nothing once the sword gets pulled out.

532
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,650
Did you really tell her? Really?

533
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:55,670
Wow, how could you! Hey, really... you! Oh no! Oh no!

534
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:58,450
How? How? He's coming in, coming in!

535
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:04,380
Hey, there. I'm really sorry, but it's an emergency... Could I use the toilet?

536
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,780
This is a human being, right?

537
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:10,040
It's not an immortal for sure... But human beings cannot enter this place!

538
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:10,880
Wow.

539
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,530
Please... What should I do... It's urgent!!

540
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,460
Thank you, thank you. It's really urgent.

541
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,710
Wow... There is no door that a human being's desperation can't open.

542
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,260
I can't believe it even after witnessing it.

543
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:30,720
You even believe in God that's not visible. <br>Then, why can't you believe a human being's desperation?

544
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,390
That's called the will of a human being. The power that enables them to change their destiny on their own!

545
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:38,910
How can an immortal's tea-place be a human being's mark of territory?

546
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:42,480
How can I write an explanation report for this case...!

547
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,590
Sit.

548
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,750
Write this one, too; it happened because of you!

549
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,080
You can make Deok Hwa do it when you get home.

550
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,930
<i>[Hiring] </i>

551
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:00,590
Do you have a boyfriend?

552
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,050
I am Ji Eun Tak.

553
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:28,490
I lost my parents at age nine and...

554
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:40,150
You can ask me about anything that you're curious about.

555
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:43,590
I can adjust myself so that I can satisfy all your requirements.

556
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,730
Do you have any plans later on?

557
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:53,130
- No. <br>- Then, today is our official first day together.

558
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,660
Get to work.

559
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:59,330
Yes! I'll take care of everything!

560
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,030
But how did you move to a better place?

561
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:09,230
Life is all or nothing. I got my apartment security deposit back.

562
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,500
How did you find me here without even calling me beforehand?

563
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,360
I have my own means.

564
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,930
Even ghosts would be surprised.

565
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:29,220
Are you a beggar? How can an elementary student not even have $1?

566
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,820
You guys don't have money either!!

567
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:35,160
That's why I'm telling you to bring it, then we would have it.

568
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,400
Don't hit me! Wind blast!

569
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,360
This kid must be crazy. He said 'wind blast.'

570
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,780
Your mom ran away since you read comic books all the time.

571
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,860
Hey! You boys are cowards!

572
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,430
Come here, come and get hit yourselves, too!

573
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,380
Let's go, let's go.

574
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,300
Are you okay?

575
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,620
Someday, you'll be able to shoot a real wind blast. Where's your home? Is it near?

576
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:25,310
The results would have come out already... What should I do?

577
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:28,620
I don't know.

578
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,900
What do I do?

579
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,770
[Congratulations, you've been accepted.]

580
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:48,590
What do I do? Awesome! No way!

581
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:55,600
Now, let's print out the tuition bill!

582
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:08,350
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

583
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,150
<i>It's not an error. Someone paid your tuition.</i>

584
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:20,200
<i> He told me to make sure and tell you if you called. It was Kim Shin. </i>

585
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,760
Mr. Shin Kim? You paid my tuition?

586
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,830
Seriously...

587
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:38,690
I asked them to keep it a secret, but in the end...

588
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:43,010
According to her, you asked her to make sure to let me know that you had paid it for me.

589
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:46,630
She insisted on knowing my name, so I couldn't help but tell her--

590
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:52,200
According to her, she kept asking you for the name of the student, but you kept telling her your name.

591
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,860
I'm not sure if this would be an appropriate university acceptance gift.

592
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,620
This pretty bag...

593
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,700
It's appropriate! Wow, that's great! Wow! It's appropriate!

594
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,570
I knew it would be appropriate. Congratulations!

595
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:12,860
I really missed you! A purse, perfume, five...

596
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:16,360
There's no $5,000. I paid your tuition with that.

597
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:20,560
Mister...

598
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,630
Don't be too moved. I'm lending it to you.

599
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:31,990
I know... why did you just give it to me at first, but you're lending it to me now?

600
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:33,520
How could a person's heart change?

601
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,390
You're the only mortal in this house. How can you not know that yet?

602
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,660
- Wow... <br> - $5.20 per month...

603
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:41,490
Pay it over 80 years. You can't miss even a month.

604
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:42,730
80 years?

605
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:45,760
Yeah, you can't pay back sooner either.

606
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,030
- What? You don't like it? <br>- No.

607
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:53,290
If you're so determined like this, I made up my mind. I set my mind to it.

608
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:54,500
About what?

609
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,440
A date.

610
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:05,300
Dummy... when I was at the ski resort, not my report card...

611
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,060
If you had brought this purse, I would've came back with you right away.

612
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,490
Wow... that's exactly what I was going to do.

613
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,390
- The Mr. Grim Reaper stopped you, huh? <br> - Yeah!

614
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:16,280
As expected... Mr. Grim Reaper saved someone's life,

615
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,730
or I would've killed you on the spot.

616
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,280
Don't eat mine. Eat yours.

617
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,820
I ate all of mine.

618
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:26,110
- Don't smile and keep eating. <br> - Just one bite.

619
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,160
- But you know... <br> - What now?

620
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,590
Would there be love among these things somewhere?

621
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:42,630
Look carefully. I tried my best to put it in there.

622
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:53,360
Here is the list you asked for of gifts that female high school or college students prefer.

623
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:58,230
Bangtan Sonyeondan?<br> (BTS, boy band)

624
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:03,030
What do these boys do?

625
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,040
â™¬ <i> Why do you make my heart waver? Make my heart waver? </i> â™¬

626
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:13,020
Oh... they work to shake up people's hearts.

627
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,170
They're shaking up people's hearts quite a bit these days.

628
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:18,600
EXO? Is that an alcoholic beverage?

629
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,060
No, it's not.

630
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:26,100
â™¬ <i> Growl, growl, growl. </i> â™¬

631
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:30,210
Being an executive assistant is an extreme job. Yeah...

632
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:32,620
I enjoy my job very much.

633
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:37,300
I'll choose number three for the gift.

634
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,450
Oh...

635
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:45,290
I know what digital camera is.

636
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:58,960
<i> Dear Ji Eun Tak, you've worked hard. </i>

637
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,060
<i> I hope each moment is remembered forever. </i>

638
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,390
<i> From Yoo Shin Woo. </i>

639
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:09,220
- Oh, you scared me! <br> - Aigoo, he scared me.

640
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,390
Since when were you standing here?

641
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:13,870
Why are you so shocked? Did you do something wrong?

642
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:17,330
I was surprised by my face.

643
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:21,800
I'm handsome, huh? I'm too much... too much...

644
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,760
You said you don't even have any money. What's with the camera?

645
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,630
Ah, it's yours.

646
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,200
Why is that mine?

647
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,740
A gift from my grandpa. My selfie is my gift to you.

648
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:32,660
Really?

649
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:39,200
I'm so touched.

650
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,830
The only gift I ever received was a building. You must be so happy to receive a digital camera.

651
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:49,300
Please tell the Chairman I'm so, so grateful.

652
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,400
Please give me my camera.

653
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:55,860
Let me just have ten minutes.

654
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:58,580
- Give it to me. <br>- Just five minutes.

655
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,730
- Give it to me. <br> - J-Just five minutes.

656
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,000
Ah, give it!

657
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,860
<i>Three minutes. Three minutes.</i>

658
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,260
Give it I said!

659
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,830
<i>Three minutes.</i>

660
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:07,540
<i>Give it!</i>

661
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:10,570
<i>Three, three. Oh, it's the Goblin!</i>

662
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:18,190
It's true. Having kids in the household makes the house livelier.

663
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,970
What about the roster? You didn't receive anymore, right?

664
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:25,120
I would've told you if I did.

665
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,860
I was getting curious about that. What you're going to do now.

666
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:34,540
Do you remember that man who barged into your tea room, one time?

667
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:38,050
How could I forget him? What about him?

668
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:42,630
A human's desperation can open any door.

669
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:48,100
Maybe once in a while, one of those doors becomes a variable in God's plan.

670
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:53,240
So I plan to start searching, ardently.

671
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,960
About which door I need to open for it to become a variable to the deity.

672
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:06,450
I don't know whether it'll take 100 years or 10 months,<br> but for now I have decided to stay by that child's side.

673
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:12,040
Though, while doing that, I don't know what kind of door I'll end up opening.

674
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,200
I just hope it's not the door to my room.

675
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:18,970
But isn't poop a little petty to be in the God's plan?

676
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:21,080
What reason is there that God would block that guy's passing? (poop)

677
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,910
I was feeling a bit moved just a moment ago.

678
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:24,820
<i>Uncles!</i>

679
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,380
Me, too! Me, too!

680
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,030
Me, too! Me, too! Me, too!

681
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:34,480
Now... I'm taking it.

682
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,900
What are you doing not moving aside? Let them take one alone.

683
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,750
I don't want to! I sat here first.

684
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:40,640
I'm going to take it.

685
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,860
What?

686
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:09,120
<i>I have a question, I'll move if you answer.</i>

687
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,760
<i>Ah, what is it now?</i>

688
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:17,040
<i> Backing out suddenly while driving, solving math problems writing with a mechanical pencil,</i>

689
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,750
<i>smiling when she talks,</i>

690
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:20,680
<i>keeping her off the roads, away from the cars.</i>

691
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,690
<i>You'll never know what our boss wants.</i>

692
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:24,900
<i>Be ready for anything.</i>

693
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,840
What are you doing since earlier? After calling me after a million years?

694
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,860
It's dangerous, so I was trying to keep you on the inside of the pavement.

695
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,960
By acting that awkwardly?

696
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:46,220
You had something to say, so say it first since I'm curious.

697
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:49,620
I have no religion.

698
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:51,100
What?

699
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,200
<i>Why does he talk so well?</i>

700
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,740
<i>By any chance, do you have a religion?</i>

701
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:00,020
Were you still thinking about that until now?

702
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,550
I don't think I got to tell you last time.

703
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:06,660
But... why do you keep smiling since earlier?

704
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,550
Me? Does my makeup look weird?

705
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,860
Rather than that, don't you think I'm cute?

706
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:16,980
Where? Why didn't you meet me on Christmas?

707
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,790
You would have been cute if you had called me that day. What did you do?

708
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:21,600
You wouldn't have gone to a church since you have no religion.

709
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,920
Christmas is a bit... you know.

710
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,820
It's someone's birthday, it would be wrong to go against it.

711
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:35,020
But I said I have no religion, do you seriously think I'm not cute?

712
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:37,410
Ah, goosebumps...

713
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:39,620
Did you have to go that far?

714
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,920
No, it's deja vu.

715
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,540
I think I remember this from before. It's so fresh in my mind.

716
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:47,720
Ah, I got goosebumps!

717
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,740
You didn't have to walk me.

718
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:58,110
Why are you telling me that now that we're already here?

719
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:00,490
See you later.

720
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:03,320
Oh! It's the Grim Reaper!

721
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:09,390
Most of our sales come from that person's pocket. Unlike someone else...

722
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:12,890
How much is fried chicken? I could buy the whole shop.

723
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:16,840
Eh... you're scared of chicken blood, I read up all on goblins.

724
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,250
I'm not scared of it, I just like to keep a distance from it.

725
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:24,280
Wait... Is that why you got me a job at chicken shop in the first place?

726
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,010
To keep away from me, too?

727
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,710
Ah, you're talking about way back when...

728
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:33,000
So that was true. That was your intention. I didn't even know. Never mind.

729
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,670
I got it, so you can go now. I will live over there<br> for hundreds of thousands of years, so don't come looking for me.

730
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:38,380
Coward!

731
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,930
What? What did you say to me?

732
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:43,520
Ah, it's the first time anyone's called me that. It's really my first time, really!

733
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:50,290
The people used to say to me, "Wow! Hooray!"

734
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:54,980
Shall I show you how brave I am?

735
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,380
Where are you going?

736
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,450
Our boss isn't like most other women.

737
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:27,410
By any chance is he the man giving you trouble?

738
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:29,980
They can hear everything, Boss.

739
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:40,450
She doesn't know my voice? Her voice is from that phone call before?

740
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,300
They can hear all, shut up!

741
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,360
Is that so?

742
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:50,150
We meet again. I'm surprised that you two are friends...

743
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:52,900
He came to the old shop looking for you.

744
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,690
Ah, I see...

745
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,460
- How much did you say? <br> - Not much.

746
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,870
Yeah, he didn't. So I still don't know who he is.

747
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:00,790
It's rude of me, but how old are you?

748
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:03,340
Why are you asking knowing it's rude?

749
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:07,480
That's how you evade my question, huh?

750
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,620
I'm not evading. I'm flat out denying to answer you.

751
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:13,740
And you're dropping the honorifics. Why?

752
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,460
Why is it?

753
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:19,080
I'm much older than I look, I'm a quite complicated man.

754
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:26,340
Now, now... If you have had enough, please leave. It's a time when we get many customers.

755
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,200
I still haven't eaten yet.

756
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,680
No, you've eaten all. Now please just go home.

757
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,530
Because of you, things have gone weird!

758
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:36,570
Customer, you should both leave together.

759
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,300
Get up both of you, quickly!

760
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,290
- I don't want to! <br> - I don't want to!

761
01:12:55,580 --> 01:13:00,410
Let's see. What is X? What's X?

762
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:02,160
What are you doing?

763
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,550
You really don't know a lot about women.

764
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:06,120
It doesn't look like you know the answer.

765
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,430
Just drink your beer.

766
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,520
Excuse me, Ms. Kim Sun.

767
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,670
Two beers over here please.

768
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,740
Who?

769
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:34,010
Two beers.

770
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:39,960
Can I talk to you for a moment? Outside, in private!

771
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,120
Ah, okay.

772
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,510
What are you doing?

773
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,340
What do you mean?

774
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:58,030
Just earlier, you called me Kim Sun.

775
01:13:58,030 --> 01:13:59,230
What about that?

776
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:01,220
How do you know my name?

777
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:04,120
I'm sure that I never told you my real name.

778
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:09,110
<i> Sorry, we didn't meet today.</i>

779
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:15,730
How do you know it? Why do you know it?

780
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:22,120
I said... Ms. Kim Sunny.

781
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:25,070
You must be very cold, right? I'll get your coat.

782
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:27,890
I haven't finished talking.

783
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:17,340
<i> (What is this?) </i>

784
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,120
<i>Something went wrong.</i>

785
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:32,300
<i>Maybe, it started with you, that's what it seems like.</i>

786
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,730
<i> (What's the matter?) </i>

787
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:09,430
Why... exactly?
