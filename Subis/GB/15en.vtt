3
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,010
Oh. You again.

4
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,360
I know.

5
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,410
"I know?" Did I just say that?

6
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,500
Wait!

7
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,460
Lady!

8
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,750
- Me? <br>- It's good to see you here.

9
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,730
Do you know me?

10
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,910
No, but that necklace you're wearing.

11
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,740
- This?<br>- I made that.

12
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,910
A man asked me to design it. It must've been ten years ago.

13
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,020
Ten years? What man?

14
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,350
You should know better. You're the owner of the necklace. Do you know what it means?

15
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:53,200
- No.<br>- It means "a match made in heaven" in French.

16
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,870
Destiny made outside of man's boundary.

17
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,640
Are you living happily with the man who gave you that necklace?

18
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,130
<i>(speaking Japanese)</i>

19
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,430
Thank you.<br> <i>(speaking Russian)</i>

20
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,960
Enough. You don't have anywhere to go anymore.

21
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,420
There's one place I couldn't go. Where she is.

22
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,990
Then go there. I give you permission.

23
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:08,070
Could I? Could I go all the way there and give her confusion?

24
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,620
Is it okay to give me confusion? You're driving me crazy!

25
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,090
I feel empty. That's why.

26
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,080
Are you insane?

27
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,830
This guy lived a long time as well.

28
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,680
Return it! Before there is some international conflict!

29
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,450
He said leave. Let's go. He's scary when he's mad.

30
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,200
Ah, today is so strange. How could I meet you here?

31
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,230
I'm on a business trip. For corners of furnitures... I need some elegance... that I could reference...

32
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,110
What is he saying?

33
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,940
Have you been well?

34
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,790
Perhaps... did you follow me?

35
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,760
If I did, will I be arrested?

36
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,840
- What should I do?<br>- I'm not a bad person.

37
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,070
- How would I know that?<br>- You would know after we spend time together.

38
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:29,220
- There's no reason for that.<br>- My company provided ads for your program <br>and you most definitely said you would buy me a meal.

39
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,520
CEO, it's your first time in Canada, right? Let's head this way.

40
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,740
But... did I ever say I was going to Canada?

41
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,270
- I think I just said I was going abroad.<br>- I'm pretty sure you mentioned Canada.

42
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:55,690
- You said something like the maple nation... <br> - Oh! Maple Nation!

43
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:02,140
Yes. I remember. This way.

44
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,690
♬ <i>Only your voice is heard loudly above everything </i> ♬

45
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,050
Will that be enough?

46
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,250
It's okay. It's nice since it feels like we're on a picnic.

47
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,620
Not you, but me.

48
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,870
Will this be enough for me? Do you know how much I sponsored?

49
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,960
♬ <i>Am I really crazy?</i> ♬

50
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,230
This... it's not a vacation that I planned. I just came here suddenly.

51
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,390
So I could only exchange just a little bit of money...

52
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,640
- What do you like?<br>- Beef.

53
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,370
I don't like meat that much.

54
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,560
You do like it.

55
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,020
How do you know?

56
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,240
Geez. Is there anyone who doesn't like meat?

57
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,430
Don't mix words. Did you do some background check on me?

58
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,560
To see if my family would match your family or something?

59
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,930
Who says I'm dating you? You aren't really that good, you know!

60
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,020
But still, you have to treat me with meat.

61
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,610
It must be delicious. I will contact you later. Then, I'll be going.

62
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,730
There's not much to see here. This way. I will be your guide.

63
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,420
Can you?

64
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,920
I think I'm being such a nuisance.

65
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,010
It's okay. It's because you're excited that's why.

66
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,030
You must know Quebec well. Did you already come here before?

67
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes. I came with my first love.

68
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,410
This is my fourth time.

69
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,350
So you have a girlfriend.

70
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,070
- We broke up for now. <br> - Why did you break up?

71
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,860
I left for a long time... and went somewhere far.

72
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,950
She must have had a hard time. She forgot all about me.

73
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,600
They say that first loves don't come true.

74
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,530
You must have loved her a lot.

75
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,050
That must be the case, seeing how it's so hard to hold it in.

76
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,550
What are you holding in?

77
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,430
To hold her hand and hug her. Those things.

78
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,110
The woman forgot already but you haven't yet.

79
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,160
Yes.

80
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,780
Not even a day or a moment.

81
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,580
Good for that woman.

82
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,320
Do you know what?

83
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,850
If you catch a falling maple leaf, love will come true with the one you are walking with.

84
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,980
It must be your first love who said that.

85
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,950
Yes. And we also caught a maple leaf.

86
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,640
And you believed that? It didn't come true. You are here now with me.

87
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,670
Because your love did not come true and you are drawn to me.

88
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,730
Men always talk about women in their past to the woman they are drawn to, just like a fool.

89
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,550
- Is that so? <br> - Isn't it so?

90
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,420
Is he a fool? Is he in grade school? <br>He believes that love will come true if you catch a maple leaf?

91
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,170
Geez! He didn't even know that he was fooled by the woman. Fool.

92
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,010
<i>Who on earth are you?</i>

93
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,850
<i>Are you living happily with the man that gave you that necklace?</i>

94
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,770
I don't remember.

95
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,290
I don't know what memory I can't remember, either.

96
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,580
What on earth?

97
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,070
Nothing comes to mind. Nothing pops up.

98
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,780
Let's just go and ask. That would be fast.

99
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,480
Why are you here? Are you staying at this hotel?

100
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,370
- Yes. <br> - Oh.

101
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,370
But perhaps... perhaps...

102
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,460
have we met before? About 10 years ago?

103
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,490
<i>Mister!</i>

104
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,890
This comment is a bit... I'm not seducing you...

105
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,810
It's just that I keep getting a strange feeling.

106
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,160
Do you like me?

107
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,430
No. I'm not trying to seduce you.

108
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,370
Yes.

109
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,700
I like you.

110
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,540
For your information,

111
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,190
I don't have a boyfriend.

112
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,160
In this life, I must not have luck with guys.

113
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,550
Just saying.

114
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,580
Then, I'll be going. Have a good walk.

115
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,500
- Excuse me. <br> - Excuse me.

116
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,110
You go ahead first.

117
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,710
As expected, a sandwich was not enough.

118
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,230
How about early dinner? Aren't you hungry?

119
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,370
My treat.

120
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,990
I was also going to ask you to eat.

121
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,530
I know a delicious beef place.

122
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,060
Beef.

123
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,590
<i>I was so short-sighted. I didn't bring any sneakers so my feet hurt so much.</i>

124
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,090
Even if your feet hurt, you must've looked pretty. It's okay.

125
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,780
You now realize that you should bring sneakers next time.

126
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,380
I know. I've never been abroad, I guess.

127
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,110
<i>I know. Why go abroad at 29?</i>

128
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,310
When I was 29 I didn't even go out to the corner supermarket.

129
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,340
Really? Thank you.

130
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,680
<i>Yeah. Because I didn't have appointments.</i>

131
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,260
But still, I don't seem like a person who is traveling abroad for the first time. I go around well.

132
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,460
I just get lost a little and did not skip meals. And I will be eating a big steak.

133
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,220
I... am here in a cool restaurant with a guy.

134
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,000
What should we do about the restaurant being cool? It's the guy that should be cool.

135
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,610
I'm sleepy. I'm hanging up.

136
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,790
Yes. Goodnight.

137
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,950
<i>So the future that I saw was right.</i>

138
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,850
CEO, over here.

139
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,360
<i>So in the end you met that CEO punk.</i>

140
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,440
<i>I can't hide my smile. I feel helpless.</i>

141
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,520
Did you perhaps come here with your first love?

142
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,620
You fed her something really expensive.

143
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,900
But it didn't matter. She forgot everything.

144
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,250
You met her even after you broke up with her?

145
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,870
- Yes.<br>- I see.

146
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,830
I heard that first love gets beautified and revised in your <br>memory, so if you see her again for real it's not that great.

147
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,230
- No. She's still pretty.<br>- Excuse me!

148
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,040
I'm going to order. Have you chosen what you're going to eat?

149
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,420
Ah, yes. I will have--

150
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,520
Instead of still pretty, how about becoming pretty now?<br> I'm becoming pretty now. Of course, in my perspective.

151
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,300
Should we meet again tomorrow?

152
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,200
- I have an afternoon flight tomorrow.<br>- Before you leave.

153
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,990
Even after you leave.

154
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,180
<i>Welcome!</i>

155
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,610
<i>She isn't here today, either.</i>

156
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,500
<i>Can you please give this to her?</i>

157
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,850
That's why I wanted to go to work.

158
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,990
Excuse me.

159
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,780
Wow. Oh, that surprised me.

160
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,320
- Were you looking for me?<br>- Yes.

161
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,330
You're Yoo Deok Hwa, correct? Owner of my former store?

162
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,040
Do you remember that chicken place 9 years ago?

163
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,520
Of course. Your rent was late quite often. What brings you here?

164
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,940
You sent a letter through this person, right?

165
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,980
Could I have this person's contact information?

166
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,100
This person's? Not my contact information?

167
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,440
I'm a bit busy.

168
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,490
<i>Not Sun Hee, Sunny</i>

169
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,870
Let's see. Is there an obscure place

170
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,900
for people who are just starting to date?

171
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,760
<i>There isn't much here. Let's go this way.</i>

172
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,680
Is this person...

173
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,940
you?

174
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,270
CEO, are you a ghost, by any chance?

175
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,190
Did you die at this time?

176
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,870
Is that why you keep appearing before me?

177
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,010
Do you still...

178
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,000
see dead people?

179
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,190
Still?

180
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,570
How did you know I could see ghosts?

181
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,620
What are you? Are you really a ghost?

182
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,770
I asked how you knew I could see ghosts!

183
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,230
Is your name... Kim Shin?

184
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,890
Ten years ago, you came here with me.

185
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,650
Am I correct? But why can't I remember anything?

186
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,930
Answer me. Who are you?

187
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,950
Why did I write to myself that I couldn't forget you?

188
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,680
Why did I write down that I'm your bride?

189
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,140
You're Kim Shin, right?

190
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,970
Am I right?

191
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,250
No.

192
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,910
It's late. Get back to the hotel.

193
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,700
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

194
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,720
- Why aren't you surprised?<br>- Pardon?

195
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,280
I just sat here without permission and why aren't you surprised?

196
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,940
Do you know who I am?

197
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,640
It looks like you do.

198
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,650
No, it's my first time seeing you.

199
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,200
But since you just sat down...

200
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,010
You came to my shop right? With PD Ji's letter?

201
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,290
Yes.

202
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,980
And you cried in the street.

203
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,380
The day was cold,

204
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,070
but a full-grown man was walking as he was crying, so it stayed in my mind.

205
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,290
Did you cry after seeing me?

206
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,550
I've seen people surprised, but I've never seen anyone cry after seeing me.

207
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,110
You resemble another woman.

208
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,780
I'm not a common face.

209
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,050
Anyways, let's introduce ourselves. Your name is?

210
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,300
Wang Yeo.

211
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,590
It sounds like the name of a king.

212
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,910
I'm Sunny.

213
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,230
S-U-N-N-Y.

214
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,740
I wanted to see you.<br> (Sounds the same as 'I missed you'.)

215
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,600
I saw the CCTV.

216
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,480
You looked so handsome and I was so curious to see the real person.

217
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,960
But the screen is better.

218
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,440
Thank you for bringing the letter.

219
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,290
Thanks to that, our PD Ji got to travel abroad.

220
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,590
Since I've seen you in person, I'll get going now.

221
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,140
I need to get to work.

222
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,350
The day is cold, so don't walk crying.

223
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,380
Your face will freeze.

224
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,500
It was nice

225
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,910
meeting you.

226
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,680
Yes.

227
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,390
<i> ♫ I don’t know why my tears ♫ </i>

228
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:08,220
<i> ♫ Keep falling when I look at you ♫ </i>

229
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:14,950
<i> ♫ Were you coming back to me? ♫ </i>

230
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,430
It was nice meeting you, too... Kim Woo Bin.

231
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:28,810
<i> ♫ I love you, love you, love you ♫ </i>

232
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,850
It was nice

233
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,530
meeting you.

234
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,300
It was nice meeting you, too...

235
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,040
Kim Woo Bin.

236
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,100
<i>Remember.</i>

237
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,930
<i>You have to remember. That person's name is...</i>

238
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,670
<i>Kim Shin.</i>

239
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,780
<i>Why is it raining so hard? And why isn't part-timer coming?</i>

240
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,860
<i>The phone is turned off, so you will be connected to voicemail.</i>

241
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,910
<i>What's going on?</i>

242
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,710
<i>Oh my! What are you doing?</i>

243
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,380
<i>Grandma didn't come back.</i>

244
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,050
<i>Then you just have to go in.</i>

245
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,780
<i>You're Eun Tak's friend, right? Come in for now.</i>

246
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,320
<i>Eun Tak Noona isn't here.</i>

247
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,390
<i>She skipped work today.</i>

248
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,500
<i>Come in.</i>

249
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,660
<i>Here. It's hot.</i>

250
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,550
<i>Make sure you blow on it before drinking.</i>

251
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,640
<i>- When's your grandma coming back?<br>- Later, at night. After she makes money.</i>

252
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,790
<i>Your life is pretty cold, too.</i>

253
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:31,050
<i>Grandma said that there are a lot of people colder than I am.</i>

254
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,030
<i>You're nice.</i>

255
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,660
<i>It's that God who is the problem.</i>

256
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,150
<i>He should spread it evenly. The cold people are freezing.</i>

257
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,100
<i>Right? He's wicked, really.</i>

258
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,850
<i>If you say things like that, you'll be punished.</i>

259
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,980
<i>It's okay.</i>

260
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,550
<i>This lady has met the Goblin couple and a Grim Reaper.</i>

261
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,130
<i>I went through a lot, so I can curse a little.</i>

262
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,010
<i>He tried to make me remember my past life and then tried to erase it.</i>

263
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,450
<i>I don't know how many people are victims of him.</i>

264
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,030
<i>Wouldn't oblivion be God's consideration...</i>

265
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,630
<i>so that you wouldn't be distraught?</i>

266
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,740
<i>What is he to do that? Who tells him to?</i>

267
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,870
<i>Do you see that?</i>

268
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,170
<i>In my shop, even for God water is self-serve.</i>

269
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,880
<i>My life is self-serve as well.</i>

270
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,500
<i>It's my memories and my life, so why is he doing<br> whatever he wants without asking me? Is that consideration?</i>

271
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,500
<i>My goodness. I'll take care of my life on my own,</i>

272
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,320
<i>so I really wish that guy</i>

273
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,240
<i>would get lost.</i>

274
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,870
<i>Yes. I understand.</i>

275
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,390
<i>What are you? What do you understand?</i>

276
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,430
<i>[5 years earlier]</i>

277
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,150
<i>- Be careful.<br>- Yes.</i>

278
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,790
<i>- Are you moving?<br>- Yes.</i>

279
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,830
<i>I saved money diligently.</i>

280
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,170
<i>But I'll still eat chicken at your place.</i>

281
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,260
<i>Come. I'll give you a discount.</i>

282
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,920
<i>You have a tough job.</i>

283
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,650
<i>I'll move this myself.</i>

284
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,450
<i>Hello. I moved into the rooftop today.</i>

285
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,180
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

286
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:01,870
<i>Then, it will be "Day One" from today for us.</i>

287
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,260
<i>Excuse me.</i>

288
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,800
<i>Yes. Just a moment.</i>

289
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,200
<i>Sorry. I'm very sorry.</i>

290
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,470
<i>Orabeoni.</i>

291
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,460
<i>To you, who thought my oblivion...</i>

292
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,500
<i>To you, who thought this would make me comfortable.</i>

293
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,090
<i>I knew the moment our eyes met</i>

294
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:58,270
<i>that you also remember everything.</i>

295
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,640
<i>Because of that, in this life, we are...</i>

296
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,590
<i>I hope that you at least would have a happy ending.</i>

297
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:13,380
<i>That I have to pretend not to notice this tragedy while in our own happy endings...</i>

298
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,650
<i>In our next life...</i>

299
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,030
<i>A man where the meeting is short and the wait is long.</i>

300
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:26,320
<i>Let's have a fate where our wait is short and our meetings are long.</i>

301
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,250
<i>Religion, none.</i>

302
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,080
<i>Did you call me ten times to say that?</i>

303
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,570
<i>With faces we could meet without making excuses.</i>

304
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:45,590
<i>Ardently as the only one name in this world.</i>

305
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,730
<i>What is this? Is this coincidence?</i>

306
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,590
<i>A relationship where we can run and greet each other when we meet coincidentally.</i>

307
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,470
<i>My awkward doings are always wrong answers.</i>

308
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:04,180
<i>I wish we could meet where everything you do is the right answer.</i>

309
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,120
<i>It was nice meeting you.</i>

310
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,660
<i>It's fine since I saw your face.</i>

311
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,860
<i>Yes.</i>

312
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,690
<i>Kim. Woo. Bin.</i>

313
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,180
<i>Sometimes, Kim Woo Bin...</i>

314
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,390
<i>Wang Yeo.</i>

315
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:33,510
<i>Sometimes, Wang Yeo. Please for a long time... stay well.</i>

316
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,130
Why did that chicken place owner ask for Uncle down the hall's number?

317
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,670
And who is Ji Eun Tak whose name was on that letter?<br> Why do I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't know?

318
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:08,760
Of course, as a chaebol, you've got to go through an episode of amnesia.

319
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,050
But... I feel like I was an important person between them.

320
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:50,590
<i>My thoughts were short. If she forgot me, I am someone that she could forget.</i>

321
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,870
<i>I just missed her a lot.</i>

322
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,530
<i>Mister!</i>

323
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,480
<i>If you catch a falling maple leaf,</i>

324
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,970
<i>they say you will fall in love with the person you are walking with.</i>

325
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:50,440
<i>No matter how much I think about it, I think that you are the Goblin, Mister. I love you.</i>

326
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,330
<i>Where would you find a sadness that lasts a thousand years?<br> And where would you find a love that lasts a thousand years?</i>

327
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,080
<i>I'll bet there is.</i>

328
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,850
<i>On which side? Sadness or love?</i>

329
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:09,260
Sad love. I missed you.

330
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,180
<i>I won't leave you here.</i>

331
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,030
<i>Why? Because I'm the Goblin's bride?</i>

332
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:22,430
♬ <i> I will find you. I will recognize you</i> ♬

333
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,270
♬ <i> Wherever you are. Whatever you look like </i> ♬

334
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,690
♬ <i> I will embrace you </i> ♬

335
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:36,970
♬ <i> I will remember. I will look at you </i> ♬

336
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,850
♬ <i> Even if you're not there, even if you're sad</i> ♬

337
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,200
♬ <i> I won't forget </i> ♬

338
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,890
♬ <i>If I just hold you tight </i> ♬

339
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,160
I miss you!

340
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,400
I miss you so much!

341
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,230
Where are you?

342
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:02,500
I miss you!

343
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,020
♬ <i>I will recognize you </i> ♬

344
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,890
♬ <i> Wherever you are. Whatever you look like </i> ♬

345
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,300
♬ <i> I will embrace you</i> ♬

346
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:20,600
♬ <i> I will remember. I will look at you </i> ♬

347
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:27,960
♬ <i> Even if you're not there, even if you're sad, I won't forget</i> ♬

348
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,420
♬ <i> Your way of speaking, your expression, all of it I'll take it all </i> ♬

349
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:53,460
I thought about it, but it's so fascinating. You said you would come as rain and snow.

350
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,380
And you really came as snow. On the day of the first snow.

351
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:09,300
"B will agree to appear on the summon of A <br>on the first day of snow every year... since A will be waiting."

352
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,950
Do you think it really was because of that contract?

353
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:27,590
I asked you so much not to leave, so how could you go?

354
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:32,630
Even if that was for the best, how could you? With my hands...

355
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,740
I'm sorry.

356
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,940
You kept your promise.

357
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,260
But... what was that about returning to nothingness?

358
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,150
Not being able to see you.

359
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,860
I didn't know the reason but I felt like a crazy woman every time it rained.

360
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:02,920
It hurt. I cried and I muttered to myself. Medicine didn't help.

361
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:11,220
I should've confidently lived well out of courtesy of the love I received, but I didn't. I'm sorry.

362
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,570
I'll make you happy from now on.

363
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:30,060
I'm saying this because you don't seem to be aware, but why do you keep touching me? Makes me feel really awkward.

364
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:37,830
To confirm. Because I feel uneasy. I'm wondering if this is a dream.

365
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,960
It's not a dream.

366
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,840
I've dreamt this kind of dream too many times.

367
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,960
It's not a dream.

368
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:22,200
I still can't believe it. I'm still really surprised. My heart is still beating fast.

369
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,600
Should I do something even more surprising?

370
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:44,130
I can buy you everything from there all the way to there. In one payment.

371
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,600
Woah!

372
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,890
Then alcohol. You too, Mister?

373
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,410
Sounds good.

374
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:12,250
But what to call you... "Mister" isn't fitting anymore, don't you think?

375
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:19,830
Oppa is a little strange. Well, after 10 years, we'll be the same <br>age. How about we call each other "Honey" from now on?

376
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,090
No.

377
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:31,120
Oh yeah. What about Boss? Did you meet her?

378
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,420
From far away. By myself.

379
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:43,060
Boss made a lot of money so she became a building owner as well.

380
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:48,250
Maybe because her general brother came by. Anyway, she's doing well.

381
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,570
What about Mr. Grim Reaper? Did you meet him?

382
00:38:53,570 --> 00:39:02,610
He is still living in my house. I don't know if he's doing well,<br> but a real friendship has been formed.

383
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:08,170
To be honest, it's been a long time since it formed.

384
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,590
The fate of you two...

385
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,910
Me, too. I missed you, too. Very much.

386
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:51,380
I love you. Very much.

387
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,890
You're leaving again.

388
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,800
I want to be with you more, too, Kim Shin.

389
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,360
I didn't get many vacation days. And since I'm human, <br>I have to take a cab and get proof of exit and entry at the airport.

390
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,840
If I don't, I'll be in handcuffs.

391
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,530
- I'll come visit you.<br> - Ah, this man...

392
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,320
Or... do you want to ride the airplane with me?

393
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,790
Wow. That's fresh.

394
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,760
You don't want to? When it's with me?

395
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,830
I want to, but I don't have a passport. I came here suddenly, so I couldn't prepare.

396
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:37,380
Then, see you in 17 hours in Korea. That's so long.

397
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,690
You'll be late. Let's go.

398
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,580
- One more minute. <br>- One more time.

399
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,000
Did you wait a long time?

400
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,160
I waited 17 hours. I thought I was going to die. When the gate opened, I saw you and, "Wow!"

401
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,710
There's no angel like me, right?

402
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,420
Well, there <i>are</i> angels somewhere.

403
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,630
Let go of my hand. I said let go!

404
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,660
Never.

405
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,300
Did you forget your boyfriend is a Goblin?

406
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,920
This is against the rules! I'm so excited right now!

407
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,440
I forgot that there were always cool places behind your door.

408
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,390
♬ <i> I’m wasting my word. Wasting my time <i> ♬</i></i>

409
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:58,490
♬ <i> After I gave you everything. Every day is changing. I felt it <i> ♬</i></i>

410
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:07,200
♬ <i> I felt my heart opening for you <i> ♬</i></i>

411
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,550
Welcome.

412
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,280
Oh, PD.

413
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,840
Where's Boss?

414
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,200
You should have called. She didn't come in today.

415
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,540
I guess she must've made enough money.

416
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,820
I understand. Have a good day.

417
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:30,880
Where did she go? Is she busy?

418
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,420
I'm a little nervous. I shouldn't be at this age...

419
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,490
It's a long way. He'll be here soon.

420
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:16,960
Even the 70 years wouldn't have been slower then it is right now.

421
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,630
I'm too late.

422
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,240
How many years has it been since we've seen each other?

423
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,200
73 years.

424
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,270
It was my first birthday after we got married.

425
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:31,340
You said you'd come after training. You said you'd come without delay.

426
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,440
The DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) was created.

427
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:42,820
I thought... it would stop soon.

428
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:49,550
But it took this long.

429
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,890
Now I'm all old, I can't even put it on.

430
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:13,550
You're beautiful, as always.

431
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,020
While waiting for you, I aged. What's beautiful?

432
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:24,860
If... you were going to make me a wait so long, you shouldn't have said that you'd come home soon.

433
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:35,210
Sit down and talk. Since the tea has cooled, it looks like I have to heat it up.

434
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,850
The weather is cold.

435
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,120
Thank you.

436
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,750
I'm glad I can at least see your face like this. I have no regrets.

437
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,270
So, where are you buried?

438
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:55,320
Are you buried somewhere warm?

439
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,570
I'm buried in the North.

440
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:03,150
In the spring, that mountain is full of azaleas.

441
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,010
- You're home late. <br>- Yeah.

442
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,960
An unexpected deceased came.

443
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,680
You've got an unexpected guest.

444
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,620
Mr. Grim Reaper.

445
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,280
Is it "Grim Reaper" now?

446
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,020
Miscellaneous Omitted Person.

447
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,940
It's really an unexpected development.

448
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,290
She remembers everything. She recognized me.

449
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,620
"Miscellaneous Omitted Person."

450
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:42,670
I haven't heard those words in such a long time. I heard everything.

451
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,540
How did you not come to find me at least once, while knowing everything?

452
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,920
A human meeting a Grim Reaper, what is good about that?

453
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,100
Long time no see, Miscellaneous Omitted Person. I've listened to your radio show well.

454
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,460
It's been too awfully long to say, "Long time no see."

455
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,680
I'm already 29 years old.

456
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:05,350
29... I see.

457
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:08,310
Let's eat. Wash your hands and come.

465
00:47:53,550 --> 00:48:00,160
In the end you... met me at 29.

466
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,830
A Grim Reaper...

467
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,840
Miss Ji Eun Tak, hasn't it been a month yet?

468
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,680
Perhaps... the symptoms?

469
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:20,650
No. I wanted to say goodbye. Thank you so much.

470
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:25,230
Thank you. For keeping me alive.

471
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:28,790
I would have been unhappy if you hadn't.

472
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:32,680
I now remember how to be happy.

473
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:38,820
That's good. But... what is that method?

474
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,840
Ah...

475
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,060
The smell of meat. It looks like your taste hasn't changed.

476
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,040
I left the frying pan on the fire. Wait a second.

477
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,900
Ah. Have you eaten? If you haven't eaten, let's eat together.

Will you ever finish that book?

495
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:01,840

What's wrong?

503
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:37,990
I was so scared

504
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:43,190
that all this might be a dream. That I might still be dreaming.

505
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,020
It's not a dream. You scared me so early in the morning.

506
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:55,150
From now on, appear within the count of three. Okay?

507
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:59,100
Don't go anywhere. Do you understand?

508
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,320
I understand. I won't go anywhere.

509
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,150
Lie down.

510
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,720
You left.

511
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,830
Sorry.

512
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,290
Over there, Oraeboni!

513
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:02,290
Why are you coming out of PD Ji's house and staring at my house?

514
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,820
Perhaps, that restaurant?

515
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,620
Restaurant?

516
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,690
So that's how it turns out.

517
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:28,600
So in the end you choose that path.

518
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,020
Since you're smiling, that's all that matters.

519
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:35,850
Who's smiling? Should I be smiling right now?

520
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,310
How can you be so consistent? Even though not now,

521
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:44,460
in the end you smiled, so it is well.

522
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,760
Where are you going looking like that?

523
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,800
Why are you leaving by the gate? Hey!

524
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:10,400
Our Part-Timer, please make her happy, Oraeboni.

525
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,920
Your stupid sister...

526
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,520
will be happy, too.

527
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,360
Where did you go so early in the morning?

528
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,060
Scalpel.

529
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:34,670
Uncle down the hall, what is that watch? I want one.

530
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,440
I have to keep exact time for work, you see.

531
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,290
A grim reaper needs to have a chic black.

532
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:43,690
I like it. This is your breakfast. Do you like it?

533
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,710
Look at that.

534
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:48,480
Even before or now, such a careless grim reaper.

535
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,790
Do you know what you're blabbering about?

536
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,990
You just got caught by Deok Hwa.

537
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,900
You got caught by me first, Uncle.

538
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:01,020
When you came to my house, your body was in blue flame. <br>I thought it was spontaneous combustion.

539
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,070
Such a careless goblin.

540
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:04,860
Deok Hwa,

541
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,780
it may be hard to believe, but you need to know now--

542
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,380
Know what?

543
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:13,000
That Uncle is a Goblin, and Uncle down the hall is a Grim Reaper?

544
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,240
How did you know?

545
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,460
We just said it out loud.

546
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,110
Ah. That's right.

547
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:21,580
But you, why aren't you surprised?

548
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,480
Since I was six, grandfather kept telling me.

549
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,520
I have an uncle and he's a goblin.

550
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,590
Generations of our family have served the goblin.

551
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,090
So I thought it was some kind of odd religion.

552
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,590
But I didn't imagine he was talking about a real goblin!

553
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:37,640
I understand. It is hard to imagine.

554
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,770
So prove it. I said prove it.

555
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:44,750
If both of you did it, even better.

556
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,160
How about it?

557
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,030
Good. This is first time with telekinesis, right?

558
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,680
How about this?

559
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,880
Humans can do that. Don't you know David Copperfield?

560
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,650
Get out.

561
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:04,600
You can't do anything else, can you?

562
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,800
First, you need to follow me.

563
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,400
Once you get there, you'll know. It's not a good place.

564
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,760
Uncle.

565
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,540
If it's your fate, it cannot be helped.

566
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,950
He was a good kid.

567
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,890
I will get revenge. I have to do it before I get attached.

568
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,860
Uncles! It's a misunderstanding.

569
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:44,810
I was just going to ask what will happen to NASA in the Seongbuk branch.

570
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:49,650
Uncles! Uncles?

571
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,970
Uncle!

572
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:02,860
Au-Aunt.

573
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,860
Why are you so surprised? It's not like I can't come here.

574
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,180
Do you have food?

575
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:13,290
You don't? I knew you would turn out like this.

576
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,920
Just because you earn some money, you order everything, right?

577
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:25,020
Come in. I'll prepare it for you.

578
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,760
You don't have to overdo it. If there's something to grill, go ahead.

579
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:35,050
What about Kyeong Mi and Jung Sik Oppa? Have you seen them?

580
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,920
I don't know. Those rascals. It's been a long time since I heard news from them.

581
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,940
It turned out well. It's better since those punks are gone.

582
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,540
But... you still live in this house even when you earn money?

583
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:50,670
Even if you were good at school, it was no use. Is this monthly or yearly rent?

584
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,020
Oh, okay. Just prepare the food quickly. You should be busy as well.

585
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:01,980
Then next time, we'll look into cases close to our lives.

586
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,470
Yes, thank you.

587
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:08,040
This has been Lawyer Kim Yoo Na for legal advice.

588
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,390
We hope you have a sensible weekend not needing the law.

589
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:14,350
Then after you listen to a song and a commercial,

590
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,250
we'll meet you in part 3.

591
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:25,620
How was I today?

592
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,860
Change your career. You did too well.

593
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:34,110
You weren't even listening. Why are you looking like that?

594
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:36,160
Do you want to have a drink?

595
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:41,090
No, I need to see Boss.

596
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,840
I have an appointment, too. Let's drink next time.

597
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,960
Then I'll leave first. Work hard.

598
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,080
Then, let's take care of it by this weekend.

599
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:03,560
Okay. I'll tell the renter that, too.

600
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,220
Yes.

601
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:18,830
Why are you like this? After going abroad one time, is this a foreign greeting?

602
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:22,340
Boss, I missed you.

603
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:27,300
You weren't at work or at home. What did you do all this time?

604
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,660
Preparing to move.

605
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:34,320
To move? Home or work?

606
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,160
Both.

607
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,390
I'm trying to overcome the new house syndrome.

608
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,040
I told you it doesn't mean that.

609
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,040
Here you go. A present from Canada.

610
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,890
I took it around with me all the time, just in case I ran into you.

611
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,560
So, did you find what you were looking for there?

612
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:04,190
All of it. Even if I tell you, you probably wouldn't believe it.

613
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:06,920
I even found my boyfriend.

614
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,690
In Quebec. It's fate.

615
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:12,020
That fate, is he handsome?

616
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,420
So seriously handsome.

617
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:16,590
He has clear eyes, tall, worked for the country.

618
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,150
He must be very stubborn.

619
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:20,680
Yes.

620
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:23,330
Excuse me?

621
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:29,760
I know you have no taste for guys. With that cool restaurant?

622
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,860
Later, I'll introduce you to him.

623
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,570
I really want him to meet you.

624
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,630
It's fine.

625
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:41,280
Huh?

626
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,120
I saw him coming down from the rooftop. Do whatever you want.

627
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,500
Why?

628
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:55,120
Just because. I thought of old times.

629
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:59,480
Okay. You think whatever you want, too.

630
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,780
Stay well and healthy.

631
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:05,780
Why are you like this? Almost as if you're never seeing me again.

632
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:08,480
Then goodbye. I have an appointment.

633
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,910
Okay.

634
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:23,840
<i>You again.</i>

635
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,110
<i>I know.</i>

636
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,250
<i>Canadian ghost!</i>

637
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:37,460
That man... was a ghost.

638
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:44,090
I didn't see them for a long time, so why do I see them again?

639
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,660
What are you thinking about?

640
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,150
You came? I was thinking about Canada.

641
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,750
You weren't thinking of me?

642
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:00,090
As I was thinking of Canada, of course I thought of Kim Shin.

643
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:04,810
You went there four times with your first love, you fed beef to your first love.

644
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:08,120
And you said your first love was still pretty.

645
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,420
But?

646
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:14,820
Then it led me to think that maybe I wasn't your first love.

647
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:15,930
But?

648
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:18,550
But something's just strange.

649
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:23,640
Then who was that first love that you met in the Joseon era?

650
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,660
It was you.

651
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:28,000
Lies.

652
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:34,950
Even before we met, during a time I wasn't aware of. You stayed and left.

653
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:39,100
On the 12th year of the King Cheoljong, I saw you.

654
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,770
You in the far future.

655
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:46,120
Lies.

656
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,650
Just like a lie.

657
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:55,220
That's so fascinating and exciting. It really seems like a lie.

658
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:58,000
All your first loves were me.

659
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,060
Oh yeah. Then that day when I summoned you on the first snow,

660
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:08,220
was that what the warrior Kim Shin looked like?

661
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,890
Yes.

662
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:14,790
Oh, that was it. I was really curious.

663
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:19,200
You in the times I didn't know. I saw you like that.

664
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,790
- Was it strange? <br>- No, it was cool.

665
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:23,780
Goryeo man.

666
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:31,560
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

667
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,580
So that's why I'm saying this.

668
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:39,290
I'm saying this because it's a right day.

669
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:45,530
I'm saying this because you are still eye-blindingly bright.

670
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:52,500
I'm saying this because all of my first loves were you.

671
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:59,320
On another right day, will you become the bride of this Goryeo man?
