00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,610
Hyung, there.

<i>- Episode 3 -</i>

9
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,940
Who are those bastards?

10
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,800
Are they Men in Black?<br> (Referring to the movie, Men In Black, secret organization that monitors ETs)

11
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,840
What is this?

12
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,050
H-Hey, h-hurry and g-go.

13
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,200
Hurry and step on it!

14
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,140
Step on it!

15
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,080
Mom...

16
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,780
You should get out.

17
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,720
Get your things, too.

18
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,680
Did you get hurt? Where?

19
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,670
Hurt... that is...

20
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,220
What?

21
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,780
"Did you get hurt?" How can you ask that?

22
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,380
When you sliced the car like that?

23
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,810
Wait here for a while.

24
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,810
What are you going to do?

25
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,710
Are you going to kill them?

26
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,310
You're not going to kill them, right?

27
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,230
- No. <br>- You always say, "No."

28
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,500
You also came with the Grim Reaper. Do you think that man came to save me?

29
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,180
That sounds more natural.

30
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,870
Don't worry. I won't kill them. It's just to show how angry I am,

31
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,420
so that they would think that dying would be better.

32
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,210
Aigoo!

33
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,810
Save us!

34
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,770
Save us! Please save us!

35
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,880
Save us please!

36
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,040
For two days, this road will disappear on the map.

37
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,380
It means that you won't have any luck to be found by someone for two days.

38
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,550
It might hurt like you're dying but you won't die. Fortunately, the police will discover you after two days.

39
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,650
You will pay for your crime at the police station. You should be thankful that you didn't have to pay me.

40
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,240
At times, a god is hiding among those you bully.

41
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,950
Say your thanks to that child.

42
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,610
You two had a fight. That's all. You didn't see anything.

43
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,420
Ah. You won't be able to reconcile forever.

44
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,210
A car...

45
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,090
You didn't bring one?

46
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,380
We don't usually go around in cars.

47
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,840
Ah.

48
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,530
Perhaps...

49
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,770
I'm asking, just in case. Am I dead?

50
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,140
Is this road the way to the afterlife?

51
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,030
This is just a countryside road. We just saved you earlier.

52
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,080
Then are you going to kill me now?

53
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,480
Am I captured? Alive?

54
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,370
<i>I'm asking out of curiosity. When are we going to hear, "Thank you for saving me"?</i>

55
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,940
<i>Calm down. We are with a 19-year-old who isn't done getting mad.</i>

56
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,270
I never knew the two of you were this close.

57
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,970
For someone who asked to be saved, what should I do when you bring along the Grim Reaper?

58
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,310
<i>I'm asking out of curiosity. When are we going to hear, "Thank you for saving me"?</i>

59
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,170
Keep quiet!

60
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,300
Why are you shouting?

61
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,250
Why does this road not have a single car pass by?

62
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,710
<i>Someone made it so that no car would pass this road for two days.</i>

63
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,500
<i>I said keep quiet!</i>

64
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,490
Why haven't you left yet? You said you were leaving.

65
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,340
Soon.

66
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,720
Ah. Don't mind me. I didn't ask because I was really curious.

67
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,930
I know.

68
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,210
But how did you come? I wasn't able to blow out the lighter earlier.

69
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,140
I'm not sure. I think I just heard you.

70
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,750
"Save me" or something like that.

71
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,750
I just thought to myself though.

72
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,840
Maybe you thought aloud.

73
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,110
You could have chosen not to come.

74
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,220
There was no reason not to come.

75
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,530
I'm sorry then. You came to save someone who is not even your bride in your busy schedule.

76
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,180
I did some research.

77
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,270
You were right when you said I was living on a bonus.

78
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,160
I heard you saved me and my mom 19 years ago.

79
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,340
So I'm fine being a bonus now.

80
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,800
It was thanks to being born that I was able to meet my mom,

81
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,370
so I've decided to not dislike you.

82
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,290
- It looks like you dislike me.<br>- No, I don't.

83
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,420
If I met you again by any chance, I really wanted to tell you that.

84
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,250
I'm sure you wished not to meet me.

85
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,430
- I think you dislike me, for sure.<br>- No, I don't.

86
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,610
From now on, I won't summon you or think of you

87
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,860
and I won't do anything. So you should be rest assured and leave.

88
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,720
I hope your household stays in peace and I hope you meet a good person.

89
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,310
A pretty someone who discovers your sincere self.

90
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,020
Ah, not the face but the heart. You said you don't look at faces.

91
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,310
It's all cooked so you should eat. I will be going then.

92
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,190
Wait.

93
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,280
I didn't eat but I'm paying?

94
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,690
It was your idea to eat.

95
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,350
I also didn't eat.

96
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,820
And... I don't have money.

97
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,730
Then I'll pay. You give your time. Eat before you go.

98
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,440
Right now... are you feeding me dinner?

99
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,050
Yeah.

100
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,090
There's no way those men fed you before abducting you.

101
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,340
I don't want to. I don't want to eat with you.

102
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,040
If you want to, then pack it for me. I will thankfully accept the spicy rice cakes.

103
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,340
You do dislike me.

104
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,470
Here, Uncle, listen carefully.

105
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,360
Eun Tak lost her parents when she was young. She was abused by her aunt and her cousins.

106
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,040
Shabashaba... How much did she cry? <br> (Kid's Korean Cinderella song)

107
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,580
Who made her cry? Her aunt and those siblings.

108
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,770
There's no need to search deeply. The whole neighborhood knows about it.

109
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,070
Eun Tak's mom left an insurance payout of $1.5 million.

110
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,980
Since they won't be able to control the money once she becomes a legal adult, the aunt must be really abusing her.

111
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,370
Why are you looking at me like that?

112
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,950
I'm in the middle of being shocked about how useful you are.

113
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,880
A chaebol has to

114
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,830
use money and power to look into a person's backgroundâ€”

115
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,510
- Where did you get the pictures from? <br>- I took them while on stakeout.

116
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,500
But I didn't see Eun Tak. She must be busy.

117
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,110
What is that?

118
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,450
Me. It came out nicely.

119
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,520
By the way, Uncle, why did you ask me to look into this?

120
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,240
To punish them.

121
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,320
How?

122
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
Uncle, are you feeling okay?

123
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,690
Is this punishment? It's gold.

124
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,600
How could you give gold as punishment?

125
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,860
- What about me?<br>- You worked hard.

126
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,730
Why? What about me?

127
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,680
Why can't I receive that?

128
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,650
Didn't I commit a lot of sins?

129
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,860
Aren't I deserving of a huge punishment?

130
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Those bastards. Did they catch her or not? Why aren't they calling me?

131
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,240
Keep quiet, you punks! Your mother is worried sick here!

132
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,390
Laughing here?

133
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:10,110
That money is about to go into the bellies of those thugs.

134
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,000
You borrowed it yourself anyway.

135
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,270
Oh, right. I should have starved you to death.

136
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,450
It's no different now, either.

137
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,800
Right. I was the crazy bitch.

138
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,360
What was I thinking to have two kids a year apart...

139
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,770
- What is that?<br>- It's gold, you bitch!

140
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,140
Wow, Ji Eun Tak. She changed all that money into gold.

141
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,600
There was a reason why she insisted there was no bank book.

142
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,870
This is why there's no bank book.

143
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,800
As soon as the sun rises, let's go to the pawnshop. Let's split it equally. Equally.

144
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,090
Just you try to pull some tricks.

145
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,740
This bastard... I'm your mom!

146
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,330
Give it to me.

147
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,260
Let go! Let go!

148
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,640
Mom! Wake up! That bitch Kyeong Mi ran with the gold!

149
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,290
That crazy bitch!

150
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,630
Why is the line busy the whole time?

151
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,390
I know. The line is busy now.

152
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,960
With which bastard is she talking to?

153
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,970
She's talking to this bastard! Hang up!

154
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,800
Hurry! Hurry and grab a taxi!

155
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,300
Taxi! Taxi!

156
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,980
- I'm in a hurry. <br> - Get out of the way. Move!

157
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,280
Mister, go!

158
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,910
Yes, Grandfather, Uncle is eating...

159
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:07,760
He has a spoonful and I even put some kimchi on for him.

160
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,630
Seollongtang (beef bone soup).

161
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,940
Yes, yes.

162
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,430
But, Grandfather, about the card... Hello?

163
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,440
Hello?

164
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,550
Honestly, if you could just say a word then this problem...

165
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,640
Uncle, are you listening?

166
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,560
What are you watching? What?

167
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,580
Television.

168
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,190
He's a pitiful person. I should not be getting mad at such a pitiful person, a 3rd generation chaebol.

169
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,360
He was exactly at that age.

170
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,780
Who was?

171
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,400
The king I protected.

172
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,000
He was 17 years old.

173
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,940
You protected a king? Awesome!

174
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,320
Uncle, were you a Nae-si, by chance?<br>(Nae-si means eunuch - sounds like four-o-clock)

175
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,440
No, I was an Oh-si. <br>(between 11 to 1)

176
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,480
He's a pitiful person, Deok Hwa. He needs your help now.

177
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,400
The most splendid hour of the day.

178
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,140
I was blinded

179
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,070
and ceaselessly blamed someone.

180
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,200
Was it the king or god?

181
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,760
Or myself?

182
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,340
I forgot that.

183
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,150
<i>Him?</i>

184
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,570
What?

185
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,260
My rage of 1,000 years. The reincarnation of the king that killed me.

186
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,820
Look closely.

187
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,010
Did he get reincarnated?

188
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,490
I don't know. If he's reincarnated, he'll be just that age.

189
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,710
Eunuch. Eunuch. Your Highness. Eunuch.

190
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,470
Forget him. The hatred and sense of revenge is making you miserable...

191
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,190
Then are you happy because you can't remember?

192
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,480
I can't know by just looking. I need to touch him to know.

193
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,740
- What is?<br>- How am I supposed to utilize you?

194
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,530
What can you find out with touching?

195
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,670
Then again, why do you think he would be reincarnated as a man?

196
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,480
- Is it her?<br>- I can't know with just watching. I need to touch to know.

197
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,360
What happens if you touch? What?

198
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,040
It's her! Say that it's her. I'm prepared to forgive.

199
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,530
- I thought it was a rage of 1,000 years.<br>- He must have had his reasons.

200
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,860
As you know a rage is everywhere then nowhere... Where are you going?

201
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,790
What happens if you touch? Why are you only talking among yourselves?

202
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,190
Aigoo, aigoo.

203
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,380
Oppa!

204
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,010
Greetings, Senior. I'm Grim Reaper Kim of '22 class.

205
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,030
Greetings, Senior. I'm Grim Reaper Kim of '23 class.

206
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,030
You're working hard. Sit down.

207
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,450
Yes, we will work hard.

208
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,970
Aigoo, so new.

209
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,730
There was a time we were like that, too.

210
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,410
Class of '22, Reaper Kim.

211
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,370
- Rest.<br>- Yes, we will work hard.

212
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,140
You're here. By the way, Seniors,

213
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,560
why aren't you checking the company email? You know the miscellaneous omitted persons?

214
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,680
It's been approved and they've made a task force.

215
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,080
I hope you submit the list before the end of the year.

216
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,350
I don't have any. You've got two, right?

217
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,070
Who says? Who said I have two?

218
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,940
Everyone says you have two.

219
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,900
- I'll submit it soon. <br>- I'd appreciate that.

220
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,510
It's time for me to go now.

221
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,110
I'll see you at the winter workshop.

222
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,520
Aigoo, work hard.

223
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,610
That's her. Her.

224
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:05,570
Greetings, Seniors. I'm Reaper Kim of class of '23.

225
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,440
- Ah, yes. <br> - Nice to meet you all.

226
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,690
Go on.

227
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,110
So pretty.

228
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,210
She should be an angel. Why is she a grim reaper?

229
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,510
Her class is so excited because of her.

230
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,740
You are the one who's so excited because of her from our class.

231
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,270
Move out of the way!

232
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,530
Oppa! Oppa!

233
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,110
Are you alright?

234
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,370
Then I will be going now.

235
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,580
Bye. And also,

236
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,710
we have a company dinner at the end of the month.

237
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,280
There's a penalty if you miss out. I hope you miss out.

00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,330
Did you call the OR?

240
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,940
We don't have time! Hurry up!

241
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,550
Mr. Choi Young Jae?

242
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,660
I'm sorry, later. The guardian should wait outside.

243
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,130
Age: 33. Byeongshin Year, Moosul Month, Gisa Day.

244

Died at 17:41. Cause: Overwork.

245
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,890
It's you, right?

246
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,510
Am I... dead?

247
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,840
Hey! Choi Young Jae!

248
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,480
Choi Young Jae!

249
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,860
No, Oppa.

250
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,870
Young Jae...

251
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,470
- Oppa!<br>- Choi Young Jae!

252
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,410
Young Jae...

253
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,320
Oppa!

254
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,900
Thanks to your emergency treatment

255
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,920
this patient is saved.

256
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,120
The vitals are stable. The patient is alive.

257
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,430
It's a relief.

<i>I wanted to get a book, not someone's memory.</i>

271
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,550
Look. If there's something like this in a book

272
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,950
then what should I do? Give me a refund.

273
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,040
Sir, I can't do anything without a receiptâ€”

274
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,770
I will buy that.

275
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,220
Are you the owner of this memory?

276
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,110
Yes, yes. It's my memory. I will buy it.

277
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,160
You don't have the evidence that it's yours.

278
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,620
Where is this leaf from?

279
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,320
But... even if I tell you where I got it,

280
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,390
you wouldn't know.

281
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,230
Correct answer.

282
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,440
I thought I lost it. Thank you.

283
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,710
I get that. I think you're past the age to be reading that.

284
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,280
Oh... it's just for research.

285
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:16,440
What about you? Why did you get this book?

286
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,180
Ah. I know a goblin.

287
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,440
- Excuse me? <br> - What?

288
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,230
Doesn't everyone know at least one goblin?

289
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,270
Really?

290
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,590
What do you mean, really, Young Woman?

291
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,810
What do you say when someone asks you to cosign? "No."

292
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,500
When someone says, "This jade heating pad is nice," then what do you say?

293
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,050
"I don't want it." What if someone asks to buy you snacks?

294
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,680
"Get lost."

295
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,960
Pay for the book. $10.

296
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,110
How much longer do I have to sit here?

297
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,170
I'm sorry.

298
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,340
But...

299
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,760
this book should be considered a used book, no?

300
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,390
No, I won't.

301
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,740
Get lost.

302
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,470
Uncle!

303
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:21,290
G- G- Grandfather.

304
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,030
I came to see how he was doing on my way from the dry cleaners.

305
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,610
But then, I see there is a guest.

306
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,530
Ah. A g-guest...

307
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,130
Who are you?

308
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,230
What brings you...

309
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,640
to my uncle's house?

310
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:50,590
I am... that person's friend. I came to visit.

311
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,930
Ah! You came to visit your friend.

312
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,540
You must be a very close friend of my uncle's.

313
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,530
Because Uncle is going overseas,

314
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,870
you must have came to have a farewell party.

315
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,730
Farewell.

316
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,780
I hope you stay healthy. Don't ever come back.

317
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,430
I hope you stay there happily ever after.

318
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,970
Farewell to you. You and I aren't close.

319
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,590
Hurry and get out of my house. Don't ever come back.

320
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,150
Uncle, why are you acting this way?

321
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,720
To your really, really close friend.

322
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,950
Do you think this doesn't go for you?

323
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,120
You leave also. Really, really quickly.

324
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,190
Wow. How could he do that? Isn't he so mean?

325
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,650
Tell me about it.

326
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,900
Right? How could he kick me out, too?

327
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,720
Would a real uncle really do that to me?

328
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,830
- He will be going soon.<br>- That should be the case.

329
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,080
If not, you will be the one to go.

330
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,480
Somewhere.

331
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,400
That place isn't somewhere good, right?

332
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,700
- Come in. <br> - No thanks.

333
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,280
- No matter how much you plead...<br>- Not you.

334
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,500
You go to your own house to get scolded.

335
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,040
1-0.

336
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,510
Me? Get scolded? Why would I be scolded?

337
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,730
Did you tell Grandpa everything by any chance?

338
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,560
Wow! So petty!

339
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,600
How much did you tell him? I should know so that I can match things up.

340
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,810
Did you match with me when you put the house up for rent?

341
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,780
I can't go. Where would I go?

342
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,040
I will die here.

343
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,660
Oh, yeah.

344
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,190

345
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,700

00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,420
Hey! Grim Reaper! Aren't you going to clean this up?

347
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,500
Hey! I'm sorry! Clean this up.

348
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,910
Yes?

349
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,310
You...

350
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,230
Did you sleep here?

351
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:44,170
I'm sorry. I was going to tell you but I keep missing the right time.

352
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,580
I'm really sorry.

353
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,090
How did you know?

354
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,570
I don't brush my teeth in the store.

355
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,830
I have more proof.

356
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,090
<i>Boss, to be honest,</i>

357
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:08,140
<i>I sleep in the store.</i>

358
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,340
<i>Boss, can I inconvenience you a bit?</i>

359
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,980
<i>Boss, I'm sleeping in the shop for now. </i>

360
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,880
<i>As that's my situation for now. </i>

361
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,920
<i>I stayed here well. </i>

362
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,420
<i>I got kicked out of the house. Please save me.</i>

363
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,340
- I'm sorry.<br>- Is it because of your aunt?

364
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,270
That's one reason.

365
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:46,380
-Then one thing led to another. <br> - Understood.

366
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,330
Aren't you going to ask more?

367
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,440
Why ask more? It's not like I'll resolve it for you.

368
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,010
I'm just doing what I can do.

369
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,270
Here, your pay for one week.

370
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,310
I will pay you weekly. Why?

371
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,210
If I give it to you monthly, you might not get it.

372
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,370
Even if you do sleep here, go to the sauna and wash up

373
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,630
and get some shikhye (Korean rice drink).

374
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,660
Thank you.

375
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,480
If you're that thankful to receive what you deserve, people will look down on you.

376
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,300
Not for the money,

377
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,710
but I am thankful for your coolness.

378
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,670
That money is cool, part-timer.

379
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,970
Go and wash up. Grill one squid for me before you go.

380
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,780
Are you going to drink?

381
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,500
No, just the squid. I don't even put my lips near alcohol.

382
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,220
- Because I get drunk if I drink too much.<br>- Excuse me?

383
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:49,110
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

384
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,660
No! No! Cancel that!

385
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,260
You must have been reading a book.

386
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,160
I'm always reading and have profound knowledge in music and paintings.

387
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,270
I'm sorry for disturbing your reading.

388
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,430
I know. Why are you disturbing me? You said you won't be calling me.

389
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,360
I didn't. It was a mistake.

390
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,140
While grilling the squid, the leg caught on fire and I blew it.

391
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,060
Was it tasty?

392
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,480
Why are you here? Haven't you left yet?

393
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,650
I was packing my things. I was packing my books. Always books first.

394
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,920
Well then, since I need to finish packing...

395
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,910
- Wait... <br>- You always talk to me when I'm about to go.

396
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:27,280
It's you who's always leaving when I'm about to say something.

397
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,510
- I have something I'm curious about.<br>- I'm not giving you $5,000 (oh baek).

398
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:34,250
That startled me. I heard it as you won't confess (go beak).

399
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,290
It's because you always say things that are out of place.

400
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,750
From where did it start to be my fault?

401
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,680
From there. From where I should see something.

402
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,610
So what exactly should I be seeing?

403
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,580
In order to have effective value to you.

404
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,480
Are you going to say you see it if I tell you?

405
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,240
No. Even if I see it I'm going to say I don't.

406
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,600
If I see that, what if you start treating me better?

407
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:06,020
What if you give me $5,000, buy me meat or ask me if I want anything?

408
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:10,210
Then it would be very tiring for me. I really don't like you.

409
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,670
It's my first time hearing that.

410
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,670
Really! Really! It's my first time hearing that. <br>Where are you looking at when an adult is talking to you?

411
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,120
Don't answer if you don't want to.

412
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,250
Don't you see something unique?

413
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,240
Something that looks very painful.

414
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,840
Ah that...

415
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,410
- You see? <br>- I thought it was something great.

416
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,330
Goodbye. I'm busy so I will get going.

417
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,470
Hey, do you want to eat meat? Do you have something you want to have?

418
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,280
- $5,000.<br>- You said you were busy. Hurry up and go.

419
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,840
Then meat. This way.

420
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,180
It's the last piece of meat. Do you see it?

421
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,980
Yes. It looks really tasty.

422
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,680
Thank you for the meal.

423
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,050
I'm asking if you see it? You don't see it, right?

424
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,730
Are you getting mad at me right now?

425
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,080
- Did it sound like that?<br>- Yes.

426
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,410
I'm sorry. I was going to ask

427
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,540
what you think about fresh fruit juice for dessert but the tone of my voice went up a little high, didn't it?

428
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,790
Fresh fruit juice?

429
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,540
What do you want to drink? You can order an expensive one.

430
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,880
I'm full though. This one, large size.

431
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,330
You aren't full.

432
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,580
Me, too. The same one.

433
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,380
I will help you with the bill.

434
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,350
She says she's ready to check you out.

435
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,700
I won't pay for his.

436
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,380
What's with you? You said you don't like fruit because it's vulgar.

437
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,860
What's with you? Is there someone you will kill in here?

438
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,030
I'm a regular here.

439
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:27,480
Is it me? The one that will die here today?

440
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,130
Was I lured by the beef

441
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,560
and ambushed by the juice? And you two are on the same side?

442
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,040
It's a misunderstanding. Actually, I am on the same side as you.

443
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,740
<i>You see the sword. You see the sword.</i>

444
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,710
<i>You will pull that sword out.</i>

445
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,520
What are you doing?

446
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,910
What do you mean? Why are you on the same side as me?

447
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,230
What is she? Why isn't she falling for it?

448
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,130
She goes beyond all your expectations.

449
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,940
That means the documents I'll have to file will be no joke.

450
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:09,330
Then, have a good time. I have prior appointments.

451
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,300
He really must have came just to drink juice. That's something new.

452
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,000
But then, why did he say he was on the same side as me?

453
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,680
It's the matters with the gods. You don't need to know.

454
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,750
But then, isn't that mister uselessly handsome?

455
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:34,310
Was it because people will follow the handsome ones better, that they only chose handsome ones for work purposes?

456
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,790
Are all grim reapers handsome?

457
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,720
You call that handsome?

458
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,840
Yes! That is handsome.

459
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,900
Then what about me?

460
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,650
Mister... you're just some.

461
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,710
Enough. You are full.

462
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,840
Oh, that mister is also handsome. This must be the place to be.

463
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:19,320
<i>I will be there soon. See you soon. I love you.</i>

464
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:25,510
Honey, I miss you so I will be there quick.

465
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,690
What are you doing?

466
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,210
Something anyone wishes for.

467
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,180
Are you alright?

468
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,880
Magic.

469
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,340
Oh my. I'm sorry.

470
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,860
I'll untie it.

471
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,830
Yes?

472
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,820
- Ahh! <br> - What's wrong?

473
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,120
I'm so sorry.

474
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,640
- No. <br>- It's untangled.

475
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,350
Are you alright?

476
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,420
Yes. Today is a really strange day.

477
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,980
It's like magic.

478
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,190
That's why I'm asking, do you have a boyfriend?

479
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,330
No. My family's very strict.

480
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,300
So they were strict.

481
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,800
Do you have a girlfriend?

482
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,110
I've been single since birth, because I was waiting for you.

483
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:09,180
Kiss. Kiss.

484
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,820
Kiss!

485
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,830
Is being a Cupid your side job?

486
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,900
That was that, right? Guardian angel, that.

487
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,480
1 or 2 people in a 100 years, are born with the same face from a previous life.

488
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,150
So, I know that man's previous life.

489
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,190
That woman was not to lose that man.

490
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,370
Wow. What was his past life?

491
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,850
Was he the man who saved a country that I have only heard about?

492
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,650
He was a supervisor who was worse than the landlord that extorted his tenant farmers.

493
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,710
Then why did you help? Are you also being a guardian angel for bad guys?

494
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,990
How can you do that? You make nice people lose hope.

495
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:55,660
I'm not their guardian god, but rather <br>the guardian god of the man and woman those two just lost.

496
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,790
<i> I love you.</i>

497
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,250
<i>I love you, too.</i>

498
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,450
<i>I miss you so I will hurry over.</i>

499
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,360
<i>Don't hurry, just slow down or else you'll get hurt. Okay?</i>

500
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,310
Wow!

501
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,740
The man is a liar and a coward,

502
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,550
and the woman is vain and ungrateful.

503
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,230
Now, those two will be each other's hell.

504
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,500
Wow. That's pretty cool.

505
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:23,340
I make those magic-like moments for humans once in a while.

506
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:30,410
But then, from earlier, why are you talking like in historical dramas?

507
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:34,560
Just when I thought I figured you out.

508
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:40,820
Of course. Is my life like this

509
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,090
because I committed a huge sin in my past life?

510
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:49,090
Is it my punishment to be born as the goblin's bride?

511
00:42:52,590 --> 00:43:00,050
I don't know what you did in your past life. <br>It's still too early to discuss at 19 years of age, about your present life. And you are not the goblin's bride.

512
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,460
You're not falling for it.

513
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,960
My life's been full of lots of misery and hardships, but I like my life, too.

514
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,770
I received a lot of love from my mom. I now have an umbrella.

515
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,370
And it's nice to have met you.

516
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:18,600
It was nice. It's in past tense.

517
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:24,500
You also have grudges. You haven't answered whether you see it or not.

518
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,060
Do you see it or not?

519
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:33,840
My mom said this. A person needs to recognize where he's supposed to lay down before stretching out his legs and know when it's time to leave.

520
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,940
You understand what I mean, right?

521
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,790
I don't.

522
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,970
It means we end here.

523
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,200
I will be going this way. Goodbye.

524
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:14,620
â™¬ <i> Through the endless daydream I saw you on the way back </i> â™¬

525
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:21,920
â™¬ <i> There I walk with you in my arms </i> â™¬

526
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:29,440
â™¬ <i> Through the blurry darkness was veiling on the twilight </i> â™¬

527
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:36,560
â™¬ <i> We've been far away from my fears </i> â™¬

528
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:44,230
â™¬ <i> Somewhere I will see you with the days like a blossom </i> â™¬

529
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:51,400
â™¬ <i> Blooming all around you so bright </i> â™¬

530
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,140
<i>Wow. That's pretty cool.</i>

531
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,040
Wow. That's pretty cool.

532
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,430
Uncle, you looked like a painting just now. What about the uncle down the hall?

533
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:08,300
- Not yet.<br>- Well, he must be working overtime.

534
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:13,110
Uncle, you know, I should become a grim reaper like the uncle down the hall, when I die.

535
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,420
If you open the last room in the hallway of life, there is death, isn't it?

536
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,190
And the one to greet you is the uncle down the hall.

537
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:21,990
Wake up. There's no chance for you with your sin.

538
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:27,220
I'd hate to tell you this, but in order to become a grim reaper you need to commit a huge sin...

539
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,250
Huge sin? What kind of huge sin?

540
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,430
How did you know?

541
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:34,030
Wow! Awesome! Is he really a murderer?

542
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:36,410
Wow! You can never know with a person's face.

543
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,590
Not that. How did you know he was a grim reaper?

544
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,730
Uncle, don't you feel like your question is a bit late?

545
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:50,130
That time, when you were depressed and you were creating clouds and whatnot in the living room. When the uncle down the hall came in, I was so nervous.

546
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:52,130
But then that uncle didn't even flinch.

547
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:56,310
<i>- What's wrong with him?</i><br>- I was there when you were talking about grim reaper's foresight and all that.

548
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,640
<i>Grim Reaper who's saying all sorts of things in front of the kid.</i>

549
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,190
<i>I hope you don't look down upon the grim reaper's foresight.</i>

550
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:06,890
Was that all? His face is all white and such red lips and wears all black clothes.

551
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:11,630
I thought he was some celebrity. Then I will be going then.

552
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:27,610
You. How did you know I was a grim reaper?

553
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:32,770
How could I not know when you're like this? A person who was there is now here!

554
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:38,660
Please be careful! Both of you are so careless and naive.

555
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,160
I got caught because of you. A goblin who talks behind others' back.

556
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,670
Look at how you look, if it's because of me. <br>A Grim Reaper who might've been a murderer in his past life!

557
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:05,460
And you're being punished like this because you haven't killed a single ant!

558
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,680
Tsk.

559
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,010
He must be really hurt. What should we do?

560
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,950
Don't you see that I'm not all that inclined either?

561
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,950
A big sin?

562
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:38,020
<i>Unfilial, disloyal, immodest, unrestricted, unvirtuous.</i>

563
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,350
Let's not go that far. It probably wasn't.

564
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,940
<i>No. It wasn't.</i>

565
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,140
What? Why are you here?

566
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:59,150
A responsible action. An effort to be a better person. Most would call it an apology.

567
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:02,390
I was too much earlier. I'm sorry.

568
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,600
Among these, what was I not?

569
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,000
- Unfilial? <br>- Get out.

570
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,990
I was also too much just now. I thought you would laugh.

571
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,790
Get out.

572
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:12,820
What's so important about the past life?

573
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:17,000
It's not important to me what you did or what you were in the past life.

574
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,450
- Really?<br>- Yeah. Because whatever you were, it's unchanging about how I don't like you.

575
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,960
I can't laugh.

576
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,610
Even when they first met, I thought Uncle would kick out the uncle down the hall.

577
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:38,130
But on the contrary they are cozily getting along well.

578
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:41,670
One person is miserable from forgetting the past life

579
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:45,770
and one person is miserable for not forgetting the past life.

580
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:50,670
Those two's existences are relying on each other.

581
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,560
We are just...

582
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:00,110
people who are shortly passing in their long life.

583
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,750
I see.

584
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,580
Wait, you already knew, too? Jeez, those uncles.

585
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,220
I worry they might get detected outside.

586
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,560
You just worry about yourself.

587
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,770
Stretch your arms out. Stretch your back, too.

588
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,740
No way I am your real grandson.

589
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:26,070
You would never treat your real grandson like this.

590
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,930
- I'm going to take revenge.<br>- You jerk!

591
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,540
As you already know, this is the building I got for my 8th birthday.

592
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,190
I do know. What did you get for your 9th birthday?

593
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,080
I received dislike. But that was all in the past.

594
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,870
- And now as I grew to be an adult... <br>- You are still being disliked, I'm sure you know.

595
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,930
Since you use the card a lot without consideration.

596
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,920
So you canceled it.

597
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,860
So I'm telling you this. I'm trying to find out how to get cash using this building.

598
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,130
So start with vacating shops in a good spot. Make it smooth.

599
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,430
First, start with this chicken place that's out of business.

600
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:28,230
There's something you need to know first. First,

601
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:34,850
that chicken place has a sign that says "closed" which means it's closed, not out of business.

602
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:39,880
Second, we didn't come together. I tailed you, by the order of the chairman.

603
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,380
What kind of a tailing is so open... Well, I thought we came together.

604
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:50,150
Let's do this then. Soon, a phone call will come to the secretary's office. A woman will ask this.

605
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:55,270
If I work there. Then you can just tell her I do work there. That's it.

606
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,790
But you don't.

607
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,570
Secretary Kim is seriously... working so upright.

608
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,560
My grandpa must feel so reassured.

609
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:12,460
I need to apply for a new credit card. Please? Just once?

610
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,430
Where are you going?

611
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:30,320
- Supermarket. <br>- Supermarket?

612
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,530
Your repertoire is getting more and more insincere.

613
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,290
You don't see that I'm carrying a shopping tote?

614
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,820
I didn't know it was a shopping tote.

615
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,930
How can you actually follow me? You don't trust me?

616
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,790
Have you made yourself trustworthy?

617
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:58,240
You were going to go to her but since I was going to follow you, you came to the supermarket.

618
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,670
Last time at the cafe, too. You came to get her there but you got caught by me.

619
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:04,890
I'm not going to take her away. I'm totally rooting for her now.

620
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:08,070
Why are you rooting for her?

621
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,970
I'm really on the same team as her. You will die if the bride pulls the sword, right?

622
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:15,960
Going forever is better than going abroad, right?

623
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:21,430
She can't see the sword right this moment, <br>but I want to believe in the miracle that one day she might.

624
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,570
I'm wagered my life on that day.

625
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:29,650
There are lots of people watching here.

626
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,160
Alright. Just promise me one thing.

627
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,930
What, suddenly? What promise?

628
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,760
That you won't touch that kid if I leave.

629
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:47,260
Really? You're really leaving?

630
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,510
However,

631
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:53,470
the moment you try to take her away, I will come straight back to that house.

632
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,900
So leave her alone.

633
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,530
When are you leaving?

634
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:02,350
The day after tomorrow. Happy?

635
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,390
You weren't detected?

636
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:02,570
How can you come to the house? If my aunt finds out, we're all dead. Did they see you?

637
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,450
My aunt's family is asleep?

638
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,310
I don't know.

639
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,770
You scared me.

640
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,600
But what brings you to my house?

641
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,760
To see me?

642
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:21,660
Should I?

643
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,490
What did you say?

644
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:27,660
I guess I thought of you. Briefly.

645
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,830
So I guess I came to see you.

646
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,530
Why?

647
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:38,920
I'm not a bride and I'm not pretty.

648
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,020
You keep having to save my life and I'm just a pest to you.

649
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,770
Why would you come see me?

650
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,520
I guess I wanted to see this.

651
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:02,730
Now that I saw it, I'll leave. Your aunt's family disappeared. <br>The house is vacant, so you can go in.

652
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:05,720
My aunt's family's disappeared? Really? When?

653
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,140
Why did you come if you didn't know?

654
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,220
Oh, I left something here, so I came to get it.

655
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,030
What?

656
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,170
Just something.

657
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,840
You don't need to know.

658
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,690
Alright then.

659
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:36,040
I'm leaving then.

660
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:41,460
â™¬ <i> I'll be by your side </i> â™¬

661
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,660
â™¬ <i> This beautiful life </i> â™¬

662
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:48,800
â™¬ <i> I'll be behind you </i> â™¬

663
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:55,060
â™¬ <i> Beautiful love </i> â™¬

664
00:55:55,060 --> 00:56:00,100
â™¬ <i> Your memory, your scent </i> â™¬

665
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:07,690
â™¬ <i> It's getting erased one at a time </i> â™¬

666
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:12,190
â™¬ <i> This beautiful wife, beautiful thing </i> â™¬

667
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:16,640
â™¬ <i> When memories I shared with you all disappear </i> â™¬

668
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,560
â™¬ <i> Beautiful wife, beautiful thing </i> â™¬

669
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,390
â™¬ <i> In your memory </i> â™¬

670
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:27,290
â™¬ <i> beautiful love </i> â™¬

671
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:29,730
Excuse me. Oppa in black.

672
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:33,130
You don't need a hairpin?

673
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,960
I don't prefer hairpins.

674
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,500
Then buy one for your lover.

675
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,540
I don't have a lover.

676
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,730
A lover, you could have then not have.

677
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,350
But this, once you buy it, you'll always have it.

678
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,780
See it in a mirror once, Oppa.

679
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,530
How much is this?

680
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,730
I grabbed it first... You're crying because of it?

681
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:41,880
What?

682
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,950
Want me to concede to you?

683
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,550
I don't want to for free though.

684
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,630
If you give me your phone number.

685
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,220
I don't have that kind of stuff.

686
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,400
You don't have a cellphone?

687
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,140
Are you poor?

688
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,030
I don't really have a need for a cellphone.

689
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:11,790
Are you sure it's not because you don't want to give me your number?

690
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:15,690
Concession, cancelled.

691
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:25,500
Give me your number. Write it down and leave it here, with the ring.

692
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:32,390
First, let's exchange our names. You'll need to know my name to call me.

693
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:34,230
Nice to meet you.

694
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,300
I'm Sunny.

695
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,410
Seon Hyo?

696
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:59,500
If you like that better, go with that. It's just a nickname so it doesn't really matter.

697
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,290
Card?

698
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,120
Cash?

699
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:13,760
Who's going to pay?

700
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,030
It doesn't matter who pays.

701
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:22,630
Both will end up paying a very expensive price anyway.

702

I...

704
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,960
came late.

705
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:30,490
<i>I'm fine. </i>

706
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:35,780
<i>If this is our last moment, it is also my fate. </i>

707
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:43,130
<i>So go. Don't stop and go to the king, General. </i>

708
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,010
You're really going to be like this?

709
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:17,360
I heard you're not even the goblin bride. Just come with me then.

710
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,490
You bitch.

711
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:24,360
You won't listen to me, right? Fine, I'm just wandering alone so you be alone, too.

712
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,670
I'm going to harass all those people you know.

713
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,900
I'm going to kill that woman first.

714
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:40,530
The &+### shoe! I'll just &#@_!

715
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:43,960
Scary. Hey, that woman's scary.

716
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,310
Boss, are you alright?

717
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,900
Be honest.

718
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:53,760
Is my beauty gone these days? I totally got the vibe though.

719
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,840
He should totally be calling by now and then some. Why isn't he?

720
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,000
Oh, the ring? That man?

721
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,490
- First, please calm... <br>- I can't calm down.

722
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:05,270
He's the best-looking man I've ever seen.

723
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:08,820
Do you see how hard I work? How I drink this everyday for good skin?

724
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,340
But why isn't he calling?

725
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:17,770
Good-looking men always tend to act like good-looking men. Just forget him.

726
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:19,840
How can I forget?!

727
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,520
He's the only man that ever conceded to me.

728
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,400
The ring was pretty though. It seemed perfect for me.

729
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,320
<i>Do you have a pen? </i>

730
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:58,330
<i>I don't. Just tell me. </i>

731
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,210
<i>That was kind of funny. </i>

732
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,600
<i>Are you an engineer?</i>

733
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,280
<i>The finish of a phone number is the lips, right? </i>

734
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:52,200
Careful.

735
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,890
Hello.

736
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,100
What's all this? Is my family moving?

737
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,770
You're not in touch with your aunt? Your aunt put the house for sale.

738
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:06,800
A new family is moving in the day after tomorrow but nothing's ready so I'm suffering here.

739
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,390
She put it up for sale?

740
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:12,220
What about me then?

741
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:13,770
What about me then?

742
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:18,930
Why are you asking me? You need to ask your aunt that. <br>Your aunt took all the deposit money.

743
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:21,490
If you have something to take, take it.

<i>Lovers.</i>

746
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,450
Ji Eun Tak.

747
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:32,240
Take out everything that's in that bag and your pockets.

748
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,890
Quickly.

749
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,510
Teacher, this...

750
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:02,100
Quiet. I see you have all sorts of stuff for fire.

751
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:06,980
How about cigarettes? You haven't taken out cigarettes, is that your last conscience?

752
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:10,790
Teacher, I really had a reason for this. I don't smoke cigarettes.

753
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:13,750
The kids said they saw you smoking.

754
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,880
Let's get it over quickly, shall we?

755
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:20,900
Hold out your hand.

756
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,650
Quickly.

757
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,440
Both of your hands.

758
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,570
Look at how thorough you are.

759
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:39,840
This is why smart kids are scary.

760
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:49,190
Ji Eun Tak, I find it very scary when kids like you are good at studying.

761
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:53,790
You act nice and pitiful in front of me but you'll act completely different behind me.

762
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:56,980
It's kids like you that cause trouble once in society.

763
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:03,910
And then the truly good people will be the ones who pay for it, okay, Eun Tak?

764
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,320
Thanks.

765
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,520
Why alcohol all of a sudden?

766
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:35,770
What about you? Where does drinking suddenly take you?

767
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:42,470
The more the better when it comes to wine, women and meat. I've been plenty faithful when I was a general.

768
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:44,640
You were a general?

769
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,340
If it was back then, someone like you wouldn't even be able to talk to me. How dare you?

770
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,420
You don't know what I was.

771
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,250
What were you?

772
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,080
Your luggage... (Jim eun; how a king said "I" but also sounds same as luggage.)

773
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,870
See how you bluff. What? You were a king?

774
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,710
Have you packed all your stuff?

775
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:06,830
Ah, my stuff... Well, I don't have much to pack.

776
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:11,200
Go safely.

777
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:14,180
- I'll phone. <br> -You know I don't have a phone.

778
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,240
That's why I said it.

779
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:05,820
What are you doing? It's driving me crazy. Are you really like that after one can of beer?

780
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:08,420
- I don't know where she is. <br> - Who?

781
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:12,490
She's not summoning me. Since she's not summoning me I can't find her.

782
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:17,140
I thought I was omniscient and there was nothing I couldn't do, but...

783
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:19,870
I can't even find her.

784
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:24,770
All the stuff I have is all just useless.

785
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:29,020
That's true. It's good for just eating and playing.

786
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:32,460
Then, what did you do before?

787
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:36,230
I found her, like this, every time.

788
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:39,520
Just phone her. Wouldn't she have a phone?

789
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,300
Yeah, I don't know her number.

790
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,430
Now it's best if I don't know.

791
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:12,280
He found her.

792
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:35,310
Mom, are you doing well?

793
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:43,540
Mom, did you go to heaven?

794
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,510
â™¬ <i>And I'm here</i> â™¬

795
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:50,330
How is heaven?

796
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:53,980
Is it better than here?

797
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:00,820
Mom, I...

798
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:05,460
â™«<i> I'll be here...</i> â™«

799
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:09,920
Mom, I'm...

800
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,400
not doing so well.

801
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:19,890
No one asks how I'm doing.

802
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:33,820
Again? I'm sick of this. My raining life.

803
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:48,320
â™¬ <i>And I'm here, home, home with you. â™¬</i>

804
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:01,000
â™¬<i> With me. â™¬</i>

805
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,870
It's because I'm depressed.

806
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,370
About what?

807
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:30,350
The rain. It'll stop soon.

808
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:33,260
When you are depressed, it rains?

809
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:35,650
Yes.

810
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:40,860
Then when there's a typhoon, how depressed are you?

811
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,430
That's not me, but the earth's depressed.

812
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,400
Have you been well?

813
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,220
The rain's about to stop.

814
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:00,820
My mood just got better.

815
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:09,920
I didn't summon you though.

816
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,800
Yes, you didn't summon me.

817
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:15,700
I've been busy as well, here and there.

818
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:19,890
I've also had a lot to do.

819
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,170
- Now it's going to be a problem. <br> - What?

820
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:29,240
Now every time it rains,

821
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,180
I'll think that you must be depressed.

822
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:36,540
When I'm already so busy not having anyone to depend on, I'll have to worry about you, too.

823
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:42,500
Aren't you cold? Why are you here like this?

824
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,070
Because I'm unhappy.

825
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:51,390
Now it just feels like a cold.

826
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:55,140
- What? <br> - My misfortunes.

827
01:14:55,790 --> 01:15:01,100
It finds me just when I'm about to forget and I contract it when it comes time.

828
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:06,290
Well, I didn't say it to bother you. <i><br>[The word for 'bother' and 'stab' (as in with a sword) are the same.]</i>

829
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:09,620
You're not saying that because you know something, right? <i><br>[The word for 'bother' and 'stab' (as in with a sword) are the same.]</i>

830
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:12,450
Well, I guess there is something bothering you. <i><br>[The word for 'bother' and 'stab' (as in with a sword) are the same.]</i>

831
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:16,110
Stop saying it. The word that I hate the most is that.

832
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:18,970
Well, then I chose really well!

833
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:30,250
Keep going with what you're saying.

834
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:35,190
I expect you won't be able to hear it without tears.

835
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:37,230
I'll try to bear it.

836
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:43,460
Do you perhaps know that saying? <i> 'To humans, there are four stages of life.'</i>

837
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:47,040
<i>'The stage of sewing the seeds, the stage of watering the sewn seeds,</i>

838
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,330
<i>the stage of harvesting the watered seeds, and the stage of using the harvested seeds.'</i>

839
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:56,100
How do you know that? That's what the reaper says to the dead.

840
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:59,060
It's my 19th year as a goblin bride, you know.

841
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:04,060
I heard what the ghosts were saying. So it's really unfair.

842
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:09,420
Why is my life always 1-1, 1-2?

843
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,540
I can't get past the second stage.

844
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,880
Mourn.

845
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:19,170
To a kid?

846
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:20,560
Then?

847
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:26,030
There's lots. Tap on the shoulder. Pat my hair. Give $5000?

848
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:28,830
Ah, gosh. What about your hands?

849
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:33,510
My hands, since they do a lot of work, have to rest a bit.

850
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:39,150
Well.. I need to save them for when I receive important things, like a wad (of cash).

851
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:41,680
What? Why?

852
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,790
Forget it.

853
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:52,080
Present.

854
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:04,510
It's pretty, right?

855
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:13,810
- It is pretty. <br> - It is right?

856
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:24,510
â™¬<i> This beautiful life, I'll be by your side. </i>â™¬

857
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:33,490
â™¬ <i> This beautiful life, I'll be behind you. </i>â™¬

858
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:37,020
â™¬ <i>Beautiful life.</i> â™¬

859
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,100
What did you just do?

860
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:43,160
Patted your head.

861
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:47,990
That's my goodbye. I'm leaving tomorrow.

862
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:59,650
â™¬ <i> This beautiful wife, beautiful thing. When memories with you all disappear </i> â™¬

863
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:08,310
â™¬ <i> Beautiful wife, beautiful thing. In your memory </i> â™¬

864
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:18,200
â™¬ <i> beautiful love, beautiful my love </i> â™¬

865
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,160
â™¬ <i> This beautiful life. </i>â™¬

866
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:27,430
Your stuff?

867
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:29,320
You already asked me earlier.

868
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:34,200
I just want to keep hearing it. It makes me happy.

869
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,820
- You've got a text message. <br> - No, that's the sound of the doorbell.

870
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:42,350
It's the first time in 60 years.

871
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:47,020
Yeah... What?

872
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,960
What did I just say?

873
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,990
None of us pushed the doorbell.

874
01:18:58,990 --> 01:19:02,300
Why are you being scary like that?

875
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,560
- Go see through. <br> - I can't.

876
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,940
And you're proud of it? What kind of Grim Reaper can't see through?

877
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,460
How about you?

878
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:13,040
Oh, jeez.

879
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,870
Isn't this the goblin's residence?

880
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:24,580
This is my house. Did you come to see me? <i>Me?</i>

881
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,340
Do you have an appointment with me?

882
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:30,000
No, I found the wrong place-

883
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:37,490
Did you even give her your address?

884
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:43,850
What are you doing here? How did you know to come here?

885
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:48,340
I asked the ghosts where the goblin's house is. But why is that Grim Reaper at your house...?

886
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:53,030
I guess a couple fight is going on. Well, whatever, sort it out between you.

887
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:55,460
Since I'm in the middle of being upset.

888
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:00,870
Do the two of you live together?

889
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:03,980
So far. Why did you come?

890
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:10,310
There was something I didn't have the chance to say. You know about asking me what I see.

891
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,010
What happens if can see it?

892
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,480
Why are you asking? You can't see it anyway.

893
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,630
Who says I can't see it?

894
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:22,820
One, if I see it, does it mean we have to get married straight away?

895
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:27,920
Two, if I see it, will you give me $5000? Three, if I see it...

896
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,650
will you not leave?

897
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:42,900
Please don't go. Just stay here, in Korea.

898
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,970
Can you not?

899
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:56,410
You... Do you really see it?

900
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:58,000
- What if I see it? <br> - Prove it.

901
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,730
You answer first. Out of one, two and three, what will you do?

902
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,510
You can't see it.

903
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:07,460
I can really see it though. Really, I can.

904
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,780
This sword.

905
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:44,100
â™¬ <i> I erased you because of the many painful memories </i> â™¬

906
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:51,650
â™¬ <i> Because your love pains me, I erased everything </i> â™¬

907
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:59,450
â™¬ <i> My love, don't throw me away, me.</i> â™¬

908
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:06,590
â™¬<i> My love, I am at your side. â™¬</i>

909
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:08,800
â™¬ <i> Falling you </i> â™¬

910
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:13,750
She sees the sword! She's my bride! That means I'm going to die!

911
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:17,620
Is she really my Uncle's bride? Why is she my Uncle's bride?

912
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:19,780
By God's joke.

913
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:25,670
It's a perfect house for raising kids. Let's have kids and live a good lovey dovey life.

914
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:28,540
<i>Oh, is that why marriage is called the grave?</i>

915
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:30,870
Ajusshi, is this possibly a honeymoon?

916
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:35,010
Hello, have you been well during this time?

917
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:37,470
I've made up my mind.

918
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:42,680
I have to disappear, before I end up wanting to live even more.

919
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:47,560
Before I get even happier. For you,

920
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:52,420
this is a choice I must make, to end this life.

921
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:55,230
â™¬ <i>If it's a dream </i>â™¬

922
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:56,910
Because you are the Goblin's bride.

923
01:22:56,910 --> 01:23:01,080
â™¬ <i> I wish I could wake up</i> â™¬
