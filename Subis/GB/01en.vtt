00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,500
<i>it becomes a goblin. </i>

4
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,070
<i> Understandably, a sword with the blood of thousands from many battlefields</i>

5

6
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,180
<i> Only the goblin bride would be able to pull the sword out.</i>

7

<i>"Once the sword is pulled out, you will return to nothing and be at peace."</i>

8
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,570
<i>It was an awful oracle.</i>

9
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,250
A goblin that was a reawakened immortal,

10
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,740
is everywhere in this world and is nowhere...

11
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,150
Even now, he's still searching—

12
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,650
Why are you laughing, you rotten girl!

13
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,720
Even now, he's still searching for his bride,

14
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,980
"And that bride is me." Isn't this what you were going to say?

15
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,170
Even though I look like this now, I broke a few hearts in my day.

16
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,780
Don't come around next time and wonder where I've gone.

17
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,960
I'm so envious.

18
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,740
I must have lost my mind. This isn't something I should be boasting in front of a single mom.

19
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,100
You're mean.

20
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,200
I gave you a discount on spinach, cabbages. What do you mean I'm mean?

21
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,410
That jerk who ran off without you is the mean one.

22
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,260
That's true.

23
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,830
But that story is so sad.

24
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,540
You've got better things to be sad about.

25
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,400
It's a terribly romantic curse.

26
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,270
Having to find a bride in order to die.

27
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,230
God is mean.

28
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,950
God has always been mean. Selfish and jealous.

29
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,040
He only cares for himself.

30
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,890
Just like some jerk.

31
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,540
I'll get going. Sell a lot.

32
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,660
Be sure to stay here next time I come by.

33
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,320
When you face a moment at the brink of life or death...

34
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,310
be sure to pray earnestly.

35
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,600
<i> Perhaps... </i>

36
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,760
<i> a god with a tender heart may be listening to you. <br> [1968, Paris]</i>

37
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,080
I wouldn't recommend that.

38
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,540
If you leave home now, your life will get worse. You'll never see your mom again.

39
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,910
Who are you?

40
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,380
- Are you Korean? <br> - I'm more complex.

41
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,760
It's your turn now. Speak clearly now.

42
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,830
Tell him he's your dad since he adopted you. So tell him to raise you well.

43
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,270
Tell your mom, too. Ask her to help you. Say you're hurting.

44
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,410
What are you talking about? Move.

45
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,070
If you slash your wrist like that, you won't die. You just won't be able to use your hand. Keep that in mind.

46
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,680
- Who are you? <br> - Don't avoid eye contact. Speak clearly.

47
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,830
- Can you do it? <br> - And if I get beaten to death?

48
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,290
Will you take responsibility?

49
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,090
That's why I broke his ribs.

50
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,560
You little b*stard.

51
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,120
This is your lunch. Go to school after you talk.

52
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,690
The answer to your math problem #17 is 4, not 2. You just missed that one.

53
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,330
Who the heck are you?

54
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,960
<i> He is water, fire, and wind... </i>

55
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,010
<i>light and darkness. </i>

56
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,920
<i> And at one point... </i>

57
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,800
<i>He was human. </i>

58
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,100
<i> The people called him "god." <br> (Shin which means god in Korean)</i>

59
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,770
<i> Covered in red blood, he'd slash his enemies...</i>

60
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,420
<i> He was literally a god of war. </i>

61
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,070
<i> Hooray, General Kim Shin! </i>

62
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,920
<i> Hooray, General! </i>

63
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,080
<i> Hooray, General! </i>

64
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,080
Open the gate!

65
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,950
Here comes General Kim Shin, the champion of war!

66
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,940
Kim Shin, loosen your armor and receive the King's order.

67
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,680
You! Say that again.

68
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,930
A seventh-ranked auxiliary soldier dares to call out the name of the general?

69
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,330
Traitor Kim Shin.

70
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,910
- Loosen your armor and... <br> - Seriously...

71
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,570
I heard you. Wait.

72
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,500
Is that good?

73
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,980
Traitor Kim Shin, put your sword down and kneel,

74
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,920
- and hear the King's order. <br> - I'll pull your tongue out!

75
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,810
What? Traitor? Are you crazy?

76
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,710
Did you lose your mind?

77
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,680
General...

78
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,780
Traitor Kim Shin, put your sword down and kneel...

79
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,180
I'll meet the King. Step aside.

80
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,710
- Criminal Kim Shin... <br> - If you stop me, you'll surely die.

81
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,590
Get out of my way.

82
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,300
You b*stards!

83
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,900
We fought three days and nights in the name of the King!

84
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,160
We are just coming back from that hell hole!

85
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,470
And you... how dare you!

86
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,580
<i> Open the gate! </i>

87
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,440
Stay with them.

88
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,780
I'll be right back.

89
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,810
King above the people. God above the King...

90
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,260
They say that "god" (shin in Korean) refers to Kim Shin.

91
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,950
<i> That man's continual victory is mesmerizing the people and... </i>

92
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,400
<i> his power continues to mock the royal court. </i>

93
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,870
Please rule over him strictly with the law of the land.

94
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,450
<i> He clearly saw the enemy's sword. </i>

95
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,650
<i> But he didn't see the young King's jealousy and fear directed toward him.</i>

96
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,640
<i> That was... </i>

97
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,190
<i> the sharpest blade pointed at him.</i>

98
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,940
<i> He did not know that. </i>

99
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,190
Must you go to this extent?

100
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,320
So, don't come closer. Stop right there.

101
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,350
Whatever that may be, stop it.

102
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,950
Stop right there and die a traitor. Then, everyone else will survive except you.

103
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,120
But if you move one step closer...

104
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,210
I'll kill everyone at every move you make and lay them in front of you.

105
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,560
Please go, General.

106
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,950
I...

107
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,930
I'm okay.

108
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,310
I...

109
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,600
- Your Highness... <br> - I know.

110
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,050
I truly know everything.

111
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:45,510
If this is our last moment, this is my fate.

112
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:52,400
So, please go. Don't stop and go to the King, General.

113
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,930
It's treason! Don't let anyone in that household live!

114
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,610
This is the King's order!

115
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,140
Halt!

116
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,390
What are you doing? Make him kneel!

117
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,150
General!

118
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,650
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

119
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,200
Aren't you afraid of the heavens?

120
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,100
When did the heavens side with you guys?

121
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,850
The criminal's gaze is causing the royal mind to be in disarray.

122
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,830
Be sure to kill him!

123
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,400
This is not yours to do.

124
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,690
General. General.

125
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,770
My death...

126
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,390
I'd like to ask you to do it.

127
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,420
I will attend to your order.

128
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,190
Please forgive me.

129
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,250
I will soon follow suit.

130

<i>No one is to tend to the traitor's corpse.</i>

131
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,850
<i>Throw it in the field as food for the birds and the beasts.</i>

132

<i>Pacifying the hunger of the birds and the beasts </i>

133
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:26,130

134
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,570
It's the royal command!

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,680
You hit a boar.

Are you alright? Should I call to report for you?

156
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,730
I hit a boar.

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,800
May you only regret in this life.

177
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,980
- Goblin? <br> - Grim Reaper?

178
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,110
What a vulgar hat you wear.

179
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,350
<i>My Lord.</i>

180
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,300
It's been twenty years.

181
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,820
Have you been well all these years?

182
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,460
Have you been well, too?

183
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,430
I've aged a lot.

184
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,570
<i>My Lord, you are just as dashing.</i>

185
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,930
He doesn't look all that dashing.

186
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,120
You rascal!

187
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,850
It's my grandson that I mentioned in my letter.

188
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,080
Pay your respect.

189
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,310
Who is this mister?

190
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,300
So you are Deok Hwa.

191
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,010
I am your uncle, then I will be your brother.

192
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,170
Then I will be your son and your grandson.

193
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,810
Nice to meet you.

194
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:14,900
- What is that? It's getting more suspicious. <br> - You rascal!

195
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,650
Aigoo, I'm so sorry.

196
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:22,000
He's the only son in four generations, so very spoiled.

197
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,560
- But you are... <br> - Me? What?

198
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,600
Once there was a person born in Goryeo but died on foreign land.

199
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,080
Your distant ancestor.

200
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,820
- You look just like that child. <br> - Where?

201
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,320
Was that ancestor handsome?

202
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,740
Rascal. I don't know how this kid was born from us.

203
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm ashamed, my Lord.

204
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,590
Don't worry about it.

205
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,610
- No one from your lineage ever disappointed. <br> - But, Uncle...

206
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:00,550
Why do you keep using informal speech to my grandpa?

207
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,230
- Do you want to die? <br> - You rascal!

208
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,050
<i>My Lord.</i>

209
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,420
I came too late.

210
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,550
I'm sorry your servant has

211
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,490
been sick...

212
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,980
It seems like...

213
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,570
my time is done.

214
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,400
From now on...

215
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,320
this child...

216
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,360
will serve you.

217
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,940
He's my grandson.

218
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:50,000
This knife is the Lord, Grandpa?

219
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,880
<i>The desire of your people is saving you. </i>

220
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,460
<i>However, the blood of thousands is on your sword. </i>

221
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:19,500
<i>They were enemies to you but they were also God's creations.</i>

222
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,950
<i>Stay immortal alone and watch your loved ones die. </i>

223
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,710
<i>You will never forget any deaths. </i>

224
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,680
<i>This is my prize to you and the punishment upon you. </i>

225
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:46,190
<i>Only the bride of the Goblin can pull that sword. </i>

226
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:52,010
<i>Once the sword is pulled out, you will return to nothing and be at peace </i>

227
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,110
My Lord.

228
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,680
I have a place I need to go.

229
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:16,170
Sir.

230
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:24,040
How dare you! Who are you to belch such blasphemous aura out?!

231
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,820
Why this bastard...

232
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,140
You are...

233
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,530
I...

234
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,420
am late.

235
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,790
You are...

236
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,320
my first punishment, it seems.

237
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,360
Please accept my bow.

238
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:15,440
From this moment forward, I will serve you.

239
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,010
It was my grandpa's will.

240
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,660
I was blinded by revenge,

241
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,260
I never even asked how he'd been.

242
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,640
Even so,

243
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,720
you will still do this?

244
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,140
It's nice to see such a scene at peace.

245
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,550
I'm happy that you get to see this scene at peace.

246
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,780
Here.

247
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,590
I am still full, so you eat it, my Lord.

248
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,790
You haven't eaten anything so how are you full?

249
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,780
I am small so even if I eat just a little, I get full.

250
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,780
You are big, my Lord, so you eat it, my Lord.

251
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,390
Then let's do this.

252
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,960
We are still far from the land.

253
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,260
If we share it, neither will get full.

254
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,930
So you will starve?

255
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:26,590
If I get really hungry, I can work a little and get some food.

256
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:31,960
Did you think I brought you here so you can beg for food? Trust me.

257
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,490
I might be an even bigger person than you thought.

258
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,540
Hurry.

259
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,980
Wow.

260
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,840
My Lord! My L--

261
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Can I take a look at your sack? We need to reduce the ship's weight.

262
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:25,640
My Lord! My Lord!

263
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,570
Put the child down at once and I will spare your life.

264
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,830
The waves are suspicious like a foul one is on board.

265
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:40,560
Must be you. We'll sell the guy as a slave so keep his limbs untouched and throw the kid overboard.

266
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,020
Do you know what happens when a human is worse than a beast?

267
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,770
You meet an angry god.

268
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,930
It's a Goblin.

269
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,470
Save us.

270
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,880
It's too late.

271
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:02,520
At peace... it's nice to be back.

272
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,090
Please... save me.

273
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:07,310
<i>If there's a god, please. </i>

274
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,640
<i>Save me.</i>

275
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:21,230
<i>Save me, I'm begging you. Someone, please.</i>

276
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,550
Who are you?

277
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,800
I'm someone.

278
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,230
Please. Please help me.

279
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,410
I'm not sure.

280
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:13,000
My principle is to not get involved in human life and death.

281
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,860
I can't die like this.

282
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,560
So you're not the one you're begging to save.

283
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,500
Just the baby...

284
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:11,350
You were lucky. You met a tender-hearted god. I don't want to see anyone die tonight.

285
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,820
<i>[Ji Yeon Hee, Age: 25]</i>

286
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,400
<i>[No name, Age: 0]</i>

287
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,790
Snow and blood

288
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,180
and flower.

289
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:03,980
<i>It's the Goblin's bride.</i>

290
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,560
<i>Goblin's bride is born.</i>

291
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,280
<i>[8 years later]</i>

292
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,180
What kind of rice cake should I make for our Eun Tak's birthday?

293
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,540
Honey rice cake? Rainbow rice cake?

294
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,200
Mom, can I have a party instead of a feast now?

295
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,520
What's the difference?

296
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,330
Rice cake vs. regular cake. I want to blow candles and make a wish, too.

297
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:02,110
I don't think making a wish on a rice cake is working.

298
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,030
I didn't think about that. I made rice cake because you like rice cake.

299
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,540
Alright, starting from this year, we'll do parties with regular cake.

300
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,270
Wow, Mom is the best!

301
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,510
It's a puppy.

302
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:18,420
A puppy?

303
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:34,270
Look at this. Spring is here again. Isn't it amazing?

304
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,910
My, I'm so tired. Mom, I got 100% in English today.

305
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,860
I used my brain too much and I'm so tired.

306
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,340
Is that so?

307
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,250
- Wow, it's a cake! Mom, are we doing the party now? <br> - Yes.

308
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,060
Hurry and come sit. Light the candles.

309
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,900
I can light them?

310
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,370
Our Eun Tak is all grown up now so she can.

311
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,830
That's right. I'm 9 now.

312
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:20,010
I got 100% in English too so this is a piece of cake.

313
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:24,030
- Where did you learn that slang? <br>- You don't need to know, Mom.

314
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:30,880
I learn easily from this and that person. I might be a genius.

315
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,440
What? You should make a wish.

316
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,610
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

317
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,770
You're not.

318
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,710
You're not real mom, but you're mom's soul.

319
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,070
You...

320
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,060
really can see it all.

321
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,170
I wished for you not to...

322
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,620
Mom, are you dead?

323
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,860
Really?

324
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:26,000
Where are you? Where are you now?

325
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,570
In the hospital near the crossroad.

326
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:44,890
There will be a call from the hospital soon, and your aunt will soon arrive when you get there.

327
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:48,250
It's cold at night, so make sure you wear your scarf.

328
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:53,320
And ask the supermarket grandma to go with you. You can find her, right?

329
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,470
Down the alley where the dry cleaner is and to the right.

330
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,570
How clever, my pumpkin.

331
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:09,070
In the future, don't ever make eye contact with the souls. Okay?

332
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,230
I'm sorry, Mom, for seeing those kind of things.

333
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:19,010
But, because I can see those things,

334
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:22,400
I can see you like this.

335
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,360
I'm really alright.

336
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,980
Okay.

337
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,290
Thank you

338
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,440
for seeing Mom like this.

339
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,950
Eun Tak...

340
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,340
I think I have to go now.

341
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:54,490
I love you, my pumpkin.

342
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,960
Me, too. I really love you, Mom.

343
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,020
Bye, Mom. Goodbye.

344
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:09,170
Mom, please go to heaven, okay?

345
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:12,460
Please. Please.

346
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:28,250
Mom!

347
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,620
Mom!

348
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,090
<i> Hello? Is this Ji Yeon Hee's home? This is Jaeil Hospital at the intersection. </i>

349
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:57,540
I know. I'm coming.

00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:14,750

351
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,480

How come, Grandma, you really don't age?

356
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,380
Is there more to age from here?

357
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,730
I guess that's kind of true.

358
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:11,960
Would it be okay if you look over Eun Tak here and there sometimes?

359
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,930
What the hell? Why would I look after your daughter?

360
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,240
Just here and there.

361
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,170
Give her some cabbage or spinach if there's any leftovers.

362
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:27,190
You should've died then, why did you live more?

363

You're mean.

364
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:36,420
You're the one who told me to pray earnestly.

365
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,030
There's a stupid girl who believes all that.

366
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:43,640
Thanks to believing that I lived on a bit more.

367
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,050
Thank you, Grandma.

368
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,920
I came to say goodbye.

369
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:01,140
I'm going.

370
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,960
Mister, who are you?

371
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,630
You... can you see me?

372
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:51,390
Oh, yeah, my scarf. I didn't wear my scarf. I'll get in trouble.

373
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,160
You did wear your scarf.

374
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,670
This is Ji Yeon Hee's home, right? She wasn't at the hospital.

375
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:04,830
But... how did a kid like you who was never supposed to be born..

376
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,240
[No name, Age: 0]

377
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:16,450
By chance, did you turn 9 this year?

378
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:19,990
I don't hear your voice at all, Mister.

379
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:24,830
What are you doing here?

380
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:27,790
Go.

381
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:30,630
- Leave that child alone. <br> - Grandma!

382
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,380
- You're interfering with my duty. <br> - Interfering with you duty, my butt.

383
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,360
Why are you doing what you should've done years ago?

384
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,030
I'm glad I get to do it even now. I'm running out of time.

385
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:48,590
That's your problem. Is this child's name in the book?

386
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:52,590
<i>That child back then didn't have a name, but this child has a name.</i>

387
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:57,680
If you have a record with this child's name in it, bring it to me. Then, I'll let you take her.

388
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,050
I need to document 9 years worth of evidence to get cooperation from the Directory Department.

389

390
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:17,630
I will see you again, kiddo.

Grandmother, Mother...

392
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,340
I know. That can't be helped. You need to live.

393
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:35,200
You have to move within three days, so that he can't find you.

394
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,300
Since you've made eye contact with the Grim Reaper, you shouldn't live here anymore.

395
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,960
If I move, he can't find me?

396
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,730
He can't. That's why the land you live is important.

397
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:55,250
After midnight tonight, a man and two women will come looking for you.

398
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,660
Follow them.

399
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:05,440
You'll suffer a little bit, but you don't have any other choice.

400
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:11,630
Why are you telling me these things?

401
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:13,560
Because I like you.

402
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,150
When I gave you to her...

403
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,180
I was happy.

416
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:27,650
Her senior year is almost over and she's still eating alone.

417
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,360
If you feel sorry for her, why don't you eat with her?

418
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,720
You crazy? Why should I? She sees ghosts.

419
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,510
I'm more scared of her than ghosts. Ghosts are invisible, at least.

420
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:42,040
Look at her. She can hear everything, but pretends not to.

Why is she proud of coming into this world on the day her mom passed away?

Since she's didn't learn anything, she doesn't know shame.

01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:24,280
Your mom's the poor one. She gave birth to you and raised you as a single mother.

491
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,040
That's a little too harsh.

492
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:30,690
What do you mean, harsh? She may have been your mom, but she's my older sister.

493
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:33,850
That's what I mean. By heart or bloodline, I'm closer to her.

Mom, do you even know what you're saying?

495
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,710
Just eat.

497
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,930

500
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:01,240
I said I don't have a bank book. How many times must I...

501
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:09,850
Then, where is that bank account? Where is your mom's insurance money?

502
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:17,030
How should I know that?

503
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:21,460
You took everything, Aunt. You even took the house deposit!

504
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:25,120
Geez, why does she talk so much from early in the morning... Gosh...

505
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,080
Shut up and bring it if you don't want to get beat up.

506
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,450
Every time I go to the bank, my bank book that was in the bag is gone. Who else could it be besides you?

I'm telling you, she's possessed.

01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:56,100
But, my Lord, are you leaving alone this time as well?

519
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:59,830
That's what's happened.

520
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:03,430
None of the women I met could see the sword.

521
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:06,030
I think that's a relief.

522
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:13,200
When you're in pain because of the sword, I wish the bride would appear quickly.

523
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,000
But when I meet you like this, I wish no one knows about it.

524
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,860
Just human greed.

525
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:29,460
I feel relieved, too, that I still have you.

526
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,170
And the wine is plentiful.

527
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:35,870
Tonight, I'd like to live.

528
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:40,820
Should we toast?

529
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:16,350
When I was 9, I made up my mind to never do this.

530
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:19,790
But it's because I am very desperate, so I beg your understanding.

531
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:25,150
Please let me find a part-time job and do something about my aunt and the family.

532
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:28,650
Please let me have a boyfriend, too.

535
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:41,910
somehow, please.

536

What the heck am I doing?

537
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:52,930
Who am I begging? There's no god.

538
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,750
It can't be raining, too, on top of all this.

539
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:12,920
Is this a small shower or a long rain?

540
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,010
Is the rain actually going to stop?

541
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:21,310
There's only two umbrellas but why does it keep raining?

542
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:24,370
<i>Is it you?</i>

543
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:26,350
You scared me.

544
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,910
Me?

545
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:40,010
Me?

546
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,550
Are you talking to me?

547
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:46,730
Yes, you. Is it you?

548
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:48,900
- What is? <br> - Are you the one who summoned me?

549
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,870
Me? I didn't.

550
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:54,180
You did. How in the world did you summon me?

551
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:57,350
How could I? I really didn't summon you.

552
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:01,000
You did. Definitely. Think about how you did it.

553
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,980
Earnestly?

554
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:06,820
I didn't summon you,

555
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:09,220
I just see you.

556
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:13,060
Like last time when our eyes accidentally met on the street.

557
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,450
You're that guy, right?

558
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:17,640
What do you mean you see me?

559
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:22,020
You're a ghost. I see ghosts.

560
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:25,300
- I'm not a ghost. <br> - That's what they all say at first.

561
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,140
What are you?

562
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:32,650
What are you that I can't see what I normally see?

563
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:34,190
What should you be seeing?

564
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,480
Your 20s and 30s, your future.

565
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,600
I guess I don't have a future.

566
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:46,250
Were you a shaman before you died? Or a conman?

567
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,960
How you talk about the future.

568
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,850
What? What did you say?

569
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:54,560
Rest in peace. It's not good for you to roam around for long.

570
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:58,860
What's that flower?

571
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,290
You told me to leave. Why are you talking to me?

572
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,650
Fine. Go.

573
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:04,430
Buckwheat flowers.

574
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:06,790
That's not what I was asking.

575
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:08,860
I mean, why do you have them?

576
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:12,490
Let me see them. They don't suit you.

577
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:16,990
That was the first time I heard that. First time, for real.

578
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:22,870
You can give them to me. It's my birthday today.

579
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,930
A very glum birthday.

580
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:44,910
I seem to get plants on my birthdays. When I was 9, I got cabbage.

581
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:50,540
What does buckwheat flower mean in flower language?

582
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:51,840

585
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:19,720
Why were you crying?

586
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,980
The part-time job, the aunt's family, and the boyfriend. Because of which one of these three?

587
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,350
How do you know that?

588
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:25,620
I heard you.

589
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,760
What do you mean you heard me?

590
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,080

Really? No wonder!

594
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:48,070
When I first saw you, I did sense you had a different vibe than other ghosts.

595
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,570
You're really my guardian god?

596
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:50,830
I never said I was your guardian god.

597
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,900
My mom said this.

Everyone is born with their own dictionary.

599
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:01,310
In my dictionary, no matter how you flip through it,

600
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:04,530
there's no sign of the words like 'happiness' or 'luck' at all.

601
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:09,620
- You know what I mean, right? <br> - I don't.

602
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:13,500

Go say goodbye to your aunt's family. You won't see them for a while.

605
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:25,520
And work hard at your job at the chicken eatery. You'll get the job.

606
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:34,450
Hello? What about my boyfriend?

607
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:37,740
Hello? Look here!

608
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:41,390
How petty!

609
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,690
We've met before.

610
01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:59,740
- Yes, we did. <br> - I am very familiar with your rumors.

611
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,700
There's a lot of bluff to my rumors.

612
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,050
What brings you to my house?

613
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:06,050
You live here?

614
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:11,460
All the furniture is included so if you just move yourself in...

615
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,900
Uncle, when did you get back?

616
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:18,830
- Explain. <br> - Uncle, it's just that this place would be vacant for 20 years anyway.

617
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:24,710
So for that 20 years, how much rent would we collect? I started with that very innocent curiosity.

618
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:27,250
Do you know what that is to bring it in?

619
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:32,410
How can you call the new renter "that thing?" He runs a tea shop.

620
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,990
Sorry, my uncle's not used to social exchanges.

621
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:38,180
- Please have some coffee. <br> - Thanks.

622
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:43,000
I haven't gotten the money yet.

623
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,230
There's a new car in the courtyard.

624
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,490
It's the new renter's car.

625
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:49,550
It's not my car. And the money...

626
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,490
I already gave him all.

627
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:55,230
Then I'll return the money to you, so you can leave now.

628
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:57,330
I get your situation, but

629
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:01,120
I've signed the contract already.

630
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:08,020
I hope that wasn't an important document.

631
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,050
That was a copy. The original copy is at the real estate office.

632
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:12,850
My stuff will come tomorrow. It's a lucky day.

633
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:16,560
If you're done drinking, go. Coffee is where my kindness stops.

634
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,970
Go pack your stuff instead.

635
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:20,000
Twenty years worth of luggage will take you awhile.

You're going to fight with a goblin?

637
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,050
I'm sure you're aware of what a contract with the Grim Reaper means.

638
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:30,560
In lieu of this house, I can take that buddy right now?

639
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:35,950
I guess there's no other choice. We've got many extra rooms<br> so you can stay here like it's your own.

640
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:39,040

Tell me everything you see about me.

690
01:19:00,990 --> 01:19:03,260
- You are wearing a school uniform. <br> - And?

691
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:06,680
It's pretty.

692
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,590
The uniform is.

693
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:14,070
Is that all?

694
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:18,020
You don't see some wings or something?

695
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:22,260
I think I'm a fairy. Tinkerbell.

696
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:31,310
It was just a joke.

697
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:34,140
Wait. His phone number.

698
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:40,280
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

699
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:45,770
Let us pray. We thank Our Lord who has given us blessings.

700
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:51,050
We want to get closer to you. May you bless us with a way.

701
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:53,970
Always.

702
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:18,020
I found it out! I found out how I summon you.

703
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:23,330
But this isn't the best place to call me, right?

704
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:29,350
You're scared? I heard they are very good people.

705
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,120
Don't suck up to them. You said there's no god.

706
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,680
I just came to see where he might be.

707
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,690
How come you don't go in a flame and walk instead?

708
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:44,380
You can't do that here. It's like a type of demilitarized zone.

709
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:47,010
Don't follow me.

710
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:50,780
What are you going to do about my wish? None of the three was granted.

711
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,950
Your aunt issue will be resolved soon. Your job, too.

712
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:54,420
Not that. My boyfriend.

713
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,920
You need to work hard on that, too.

714
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:04,680
I don't think you should treat me like this.

715
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:09,280
I know the method now. It's like I got his number.

716
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,040
I didn't think this would work.

717
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,100
Why did you do it if you thought it wasn't going to work?

718
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:25,150
Oh, wait a minute.

719
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,690
Did you just grab me?

720
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:40,740
I can't do it anymore. So hot!

721
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:44,440
It was blue flame so I thought it was going to be cold.

722
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:50,190
Blue flame is the hottest. You need to study harder.

723
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,970
Right.

724
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:56,030
I never lost being first place in my class<br> even after losing my parents at a young age and living with...

725
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:57,420
Never mind.

726
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:01,310
Instead of being my guardian god or something, <br>can you just end this with giving me five thousand bucks?

727
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:03,200
I've got work to do so I need to go, okay?

728
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,180
What work?

729
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:07,160
Your attire is pretty reverent.

730
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,170
Tomorrow's the memorial date of someone I know.

731
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:11,320
But why are you going today? Is it in the countryside?

732
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,760
Over there, today is tomorrow.

733
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,350
When are you coming back? Tomorrow? The day after?

734
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:19,480
- I have something I really want to ask you. <br> - Do it quickly.

735
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:27,560
I know this question will sound weird<br> but please listen to it without any misunderstanding.

736
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,890
I got it so go ahead. What?

737
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,790
I thought you might be the grim reaper at first.

738
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:35,900
But if you were the grim reaper, you would've taken me away as soon as you saw me.

739
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,560
Then the next time, I thought you were a ghost.

740
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,470
But you have a shadow.

741
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:49,340
So I thought about it. What in the world is that mister?

742
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,220
- So what am I? <br> - Goblin.

743
01:22:53,150 --> 01:22:56,710
Aren't you a goblin?

744
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,420
What are you?

745
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:05,670
- What the heck are you?<br> - This is kind of weird to say myself,

746
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:09,620
but I'm the Goblin bride.

747
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:13,740
You know I can see ghosts, right? When I was born,

748
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,470
I was born with something like this.

749
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:21,200
I think it's because of this that the ghosts call me the Goblin's bride.

750
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,090
You see it? This.

751
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:40,620
See it?

752
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,320
Prove it.

753
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:49,490
- You want me to prove that I'm the Goblin's bride? <br> - Yes.

754
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,350
How?

755
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:55,100
Should I fly?

756
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:58,260
Or change to a broom?

757
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:01,020
- Try it. <br> - I'm very serious right now.

758
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:02,580
Me, too.

759
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:05,280
Tell me what you see.

760
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,820
- Is this your revenge? <br> - Tell me everything you see.

761
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:16,080
- You're tall. <br> - And?

762
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:20,130
- Your clothes look expensive. <br> - And?

763
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:26,160
- Maybe mid-30's? <br> - And?

764
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:30,480
You don't actually hope to hear me say you're handsome, right?

765
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:34,720
You should've had the answer I wanted.

766
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:39,540
If that's all you see from me, then you're not a Goblin's bride.

767
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:42,500
You have no effective value to a goblin.

768
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:47,490
I'm sorry you see ghosts, but just be grateful you're alive.

769
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:52,640
You're just a side effect from a violation of the principle <br>against messing with human life and death.

770
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:58,690
If I don't want to put up with it?

771
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:01,640
There's a way to die too like you were supposed to originally.

772
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,670
The way you talk.

773
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,340
I got that and I'll repeat my question earlier.

774
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,970
Are you by chance

775
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:14,660
- a goblin? <br> - I'm not.

776
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:17,560
- You're not? <br> - No. <br> - Then what are you?

777
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,820
What are you that you decide whether I have value or not?

778
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:24,570
You said you want to be in a little better situation.

779
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:30,390
Someone who is a little concerned about your sucky situation.

780
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:36,420
Live in the reality. Not in rumor.

781
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,800
You're not a goblin's bride.

782
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:48,470
Wait.

783
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:54,660
I'm not done talking.

784
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:07,030
You just came through that door? Following me?

785
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:10,300
You! How did you get here?

786
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,730
Grab the handle and push.

787
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:17,020
Follow you.

788
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:19,270
But what's with this place?

789
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:22,190
So I'm asking you how in the world you passed through that door.

790
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:26,590
Maybe this is Paju? The English village?

791
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:31,490
But this is still strange. What is this? Where is this?

792
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:34,350
- Canada. <br> - Canada?

793
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:37,530
Canada...

794
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:41,060
That... maple country?

795
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:44,640
Aurora? That place? Is this really abroad?

796
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:56,100
Amazing! You had this kind of power?

797
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:59,390
You do, too. What are you really?

798
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:05,290
If this is really Canada and if you can do this with your power, then I've decided.

799
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:08,560
- On what? <br> - I've made up my mind.

800
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,160
- About what? <br> - I'll marry you.

801
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:15,610
I really think you are a goblin.

802
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:18,070
I love you.
