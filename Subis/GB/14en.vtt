That person's name is Kim Shin.

He's tall and he looks sad when he smiles.

40
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:51,680
He will come as rain. He will come as the first snow. He will keep his promise.

<i>However, even I am not in this place.</i>

60
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:18,370
Just like that, the lone Goblin, in between this life and the afterlife,

61
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,310
in between light and darkness, in the place where even God had left,

62
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,090
is stuck there for eternity.

63
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,180
Ahh... What to do?

64
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,260
And so? What happened to the Goblin?

65
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,580
I'm not sure. His memories will soon be forgotten

66
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:47,210
and he will just be left in that great futility. In that futility, he will continue to walk.

67

<i>As he walks on... what will happen? Where will he go?</i>

68
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,950

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,430

PD (Program Director, Producer), here.

75
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,190
PD Ji, it's raining.

76
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,880
It's getting harder.

77
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,290
Are we in South East Asia?

78
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,330
What's with the weather forecast? They said it was going to be blindingly bright.

79
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,910
- I know. I don't even have an umbrella.<br>- Is an umbrella the problem now?

80
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,500
- What are we going to do about the opening?<br>- Do what?

81
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,270
We can't make the rain stop so we should just write it again.

82
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,760
We can use today's on a clear day. Keep it. For now, the first song is okay.

83
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,020
The gloomier the day gets we should go with a bright start.

84
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,100

85
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,790

93
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,980

Did this belong to Mom?

95
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,400

96
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,550
this necklace?

<i>he was so lonely.</i>

99
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,930
<i>Sometimes he walked backwards</i>

How...

102
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,840
did it just burn in this spot?

Welcome.

104
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,210

Please give me soju.

106
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,740
The broadcast today was good, so why? Did the CP (Chief Producer) make a fuss again?

107
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,970
What's the point of it being good? I'm about to get fired because ads are not coming in.

108
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,840
And it suddenly rained so it was crazy.

109
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,410
Ah, for the snack, half-half.

110
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,210
Half-half!

111
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,890

113
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,580
Oh, class president! Over there.

114
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,560
Until when is she the class president? Will she continue being the class president?

115
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,380
Lawyer Kim, welcome. For the snacks, PD Ji has already ordered.

116
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,860
Beer for me.

117
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,780

118
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,270
I wouldn't be able to get off work if I lost.

119
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,510
Don't you want to go on a blind date?

120
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,570
- I don't like lawyers. <br>- This time, it's a chef.

121
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,500
He comes out on cooking shows often,

122
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,150
and he looks like a puppy when he smiles. He's cute.

123
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,210
- He's your taste, so why would I? <br>- He's an avid listener to your program, so why would I?

124
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,290
He always has your program on at his restaurant for lunch hour.

125
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,770
Am I the only friend you have to sell?

126
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,650

128
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,090
was the easiest thing for me.

129
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,600
But I don't even have a man that asks me out for coffee anymore.

130
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,050
Right. Let's not become like her.

131
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,980
Lawyer Kim, what do you mean?

132
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,890
It was suitable to help Ji Eun Tak understand. Why?

133
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,570
PD Ji, is she your only friend?

134
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,810
Is this the only place you go to drink?

135
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,770
Rain is falling,

136
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,110
and the alcohol is bitter.

137
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,370
And I have two friends that worry over me.

139
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,120

140
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,200
She was a Goblin's bride before.

141
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,860
Seeing how the Goblin has not appeared now that she's 29 years old...

142
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,300
Honestly, she's no different from a widow.

143
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,220
Then again, she could see me before.

144
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,620
Why am I like this?

145
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,330

Oh, why am I the one apologizing?

00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:40,870
What are you doing right now? Why did you hug me? Do you know me? Who are you?

187
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,200
I'm B (on the contract).

188
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,080
B?

189
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,380
Are you an actor by any chance? The drama department is...

190
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,760
Did you achieve your dream?

191
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,490
What are you talking about?

192
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,960
I'm so proud amidst all that.

193
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,630
Yes, well... thank you. But why did you hug me just now?

194
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,030
And also, why do you keep on speaking informally?

195
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:22,250
<i>You are erased from the memories of everyone who knows you.</i>

196
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:27,240
<i>That is for their peace and my consideration.</i>

197
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:35,710
It's enough that you are at peace. That's enough.

198
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,720
Are you acting or what?

199
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,410
The drama department is not in this building but you have to go to that annex behind you.

200
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:21,860
But how did you get in here without a pass?

201
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,940
Because someone called.

202
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,180
Ah.

203
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,620
- Mr. Deok Hwa.<br>- Go ahead.

204
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,240
I am the CEO and you are still the team leader. Go to your position.

205
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,950
I thought that was natural.

206
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,820
Deok Hwa.

207
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,570
You can't come in here. I'm sorry.

208
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,530
Just now... that person called me right? "Deok Hwa."

209
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,820
- Deok Hwa.<br>- Please go out.

210
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,960
Let him be. Let's hear him out.

211
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,200
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you again. It's good to see you like this.

212
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,660
Just talk from over there. From there.

213
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,230
Who are you? Do you know me?

214
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,120
I was your uncle and your brother...

215
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,170
It's a crazy person?

216
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,950
I am not a crazy person.

217
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,510
I am hungry. Let's go. What will you have?

218
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,970
I already made reservations in the place that you like.

219
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,720
Deok Hwa.

220
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:55,790
No matter how I think about it, it's strange. He clearly said he was Uncle...

221
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:01,350
Uncle's existence is the top secret of Cheon Woo Group. <br>In South Korea, it's a secret only Grandpa and I know about.

222
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,630
Then one more person just got added to it.

223
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,190
Who?

224
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,910
That... is the name of your uncle perhaps Kim Shin?

225
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,070
CEO Kim, why would my uncle's last name be Kim? It's got to be Yoo.

226
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,990
- Who is Kim Shin?<br>- Eat.

227
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,300
Birth secret... for a third generation conglomerate this kind of tragic...

228
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:32,680
CEO Kim, don't worry. How did I work myself up from the bottom? How many years have I been eating seolleongtang (beef bone stew) for lunch?

229
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:37,300
I'll eat this and protect my company, just like a chaebol.

230
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,860
Mr. Deok Hwa, it's not your company...

231
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:47,390
It's the company of all the employees. Since those people are<br> protecting the company well, lay low on the excessive energy.

232
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,960
Lunch time is over. Thank you for lunch.

233
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,740
I haven't...

234
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,060
Here's your gift set.

235
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,990
Yes.

236
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,500
Thank you.

237
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,400
Enjoy the food.

238
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,810
<i>Over here!</i>

239
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,070
Yes.

240
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,160
Just a moment.

241
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,820
<i>You were right by me</i>

242
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:09,090
<i>and I was not able to recognize you. You are Wang Yeo.</i>

243
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:15,290
<i>You, your woman, your loyal subjects, your Goryeo and<br> even yourself... you were not able to protect any of them.</i>

244
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:21,960
<i>The use of this sword in the end was that,</i>

245
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,640
<i>to kill Park Joong Hun.</i>

246
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,230
<i>Please forgive me. Dying an honorable death...</i>

247
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,440
<i>Only now... I am able to take heed.</i>

248
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,880
What a crass hat he's wearing. Like always.

249
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,970
Are you the Goblin that was rumored to have gone back to nothingness?

250
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,820
My rumors are pretty exaggerated.

251
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:08,210
I guess you didn't scatter as dust or wind or rain.

252
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:18,440
Of course... you also did not become a radish that could be eaten. (wordplay on nothingness)

253
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,570
What happened?

254
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,060
Your memory...

255
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:36,030
I thought you wouldn't remember. Everything should have gone back to nothing.

256
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,990
It happened to everyone. But my memory was sound.

257
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,540
I don't know well...

258
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,700
but I have a hunch.

259
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,390
<i>I will stand on the same side as Uncle down the hall to the very end. I swear.</i>

260
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,830
<i>That time I was weak-hearted, for real.</i>

261
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:02,520
<i>If you are going to be on his side then just leave Yeo's memory.</i>

262
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,920
<i>Why?</i>

263
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,820
<i>It's too sad for Shin and Tak. One world closed.</i>

264
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,660
<i>I think at least one that's not one of us should remember that love's whole history.</i>

265
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:22,990
<i>But then you see... why does it seem like I discovered the door that would open that world?</i>

266
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,000
<i>Did I not close it tight enough?</i>

267
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,820
What happened to you? How did you come here again?

268
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,040
Because of A's tyranny.

269
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,790
Welcome back.

270
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,830
Really... welcome back.

271
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,680
It's nice that you're welcoming me.

272
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,540
Even though it shouldn't be.

273
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,910
Although it's too late...

274
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:11,550
Even though it's very late, I should have done this 9 years ago,<br> I should have done this 900 years ago...

275
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:17,420
The words I am saying now... I hope you will forgive me.

276
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:25,930
You who have protected my lover and my Goryeo...

277
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,670
Forgive me for the sin of not being able to protect you. I was loved...

278
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:41,130
but for the sin of not loving anyone... forgive me.

279
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,690
I should say this first...

280
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,870
I'm finally back my home.

281
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:27,250
It's my house. I still have 10 years on my lease.

282
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,110
What about my sister?

283
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,190
I haven't seen her in 9 years.

284
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:43,220
Longing for her is my punishment. Because anyway, I'm forever a sinner.

285
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:50,290
What about Miscellaneous Omitted Person? Have you seen her?

286
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,290
Yes.

287
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,960
She doesn't remember, right?

288
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,280
Yes. She became a Radio PD.

289
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,090
I was happy.

290
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,990
I sometimes listen to it.

291
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,800
Let me know, too, so I can listen.

292
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,580
Deok Hwa! Deok Hwa! Deok Hwa! Deok Hwa!

293
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,640
Hide quickly. Here, Here!

294
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,650
Uncle down the hall.

295
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,270
<i>Yes. You came? What is it?</i>

296
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,920
I met a strange person at the company, so my mind feels confused.

297
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,260
I wanted to see if you were doing well.

298
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,740
- But Uncle down the hall? <br>-Yes?

299
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:39,340
If you were my uncle, you'd be "Uncle." But why is Uncle, "Uncle down the hall?"

300
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,560
Come to think of it, since when did Uncle down the hall live in our house?

301
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,560
You'll know if you look at the real estate contract.

302
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,910
Ah. But why is there two bottles of alcohol? Did someone come?

303
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:59,840
I prefer to drink with one bottle in each hand.

304
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,230
So... whose feet are those behind the sofa?

305
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:13,570
Yah, this sofa is really pretty. The owner has good taste.

306
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,760
I like the finishing.

307
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,570
Oh! That strange... that weird... did you get your hair done?

308
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,570
My hair turned out well. I am his friend, to play in this house.

309
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,290
He's leaving. He was just about to go.

310
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,320
I had a good time. Go.

311
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,810
Yes. Okay.

312
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,110
Go.

313
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,060
- Nice meeting you. <br> - Yes.

314
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,660
You are wearing such bad clothes.

315
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:45,210
What? Is Uncle down the hall a part of my birth secret?

316
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,910
Did you hear something on the second floor just now?

317
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,030
- I didn't.<br> - I did.

318
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,520
- I didn't. <br>- I'm sure! I did.

319
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,790
You did not. Deok Hwa! Deok Hwa! Will you look in my eyes for a bit?

320

324
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:50,870
I... wrote it wrong. It really shows, not having the writer for one day.

Don't worry. I'll take responsibility.

327
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:02,880
22℃? "The weather has fallen to 22℃, so it's very chilly."

328
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,860
"Be careful of the cold." Does this make sense, huh?

00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,450
<i> Today, in the area of Seongnam-dong, the temperature soared to 22℃ (72℉).</i>

343
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,390
<i> The last time the temperature was like this was 9 years ago.</i>

344
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,530
<i> The cherry blossoms in full bloom have caught the attention of the citizens.</i>

345
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,870
What is this really? It's so fascinating, isn't it?

346
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,170
Does this even make sense?

347
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:42,380
During the reorganization time, our number of listeners fell down a lot.

348
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:47,820
So before the reorganization, let's break the mood and keep our existing listeners hooked.

349
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,620
Yes, I get it. I will send you the plan for reorganization, so take a look.

350
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,780
Who in the world is that guy?

351
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,940
Ah, what's wrong with me?

352
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,900
The medicine only works just for a little while. I mean...

353
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,490
- What exactly was that? <br> - What do you mean?

354
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:45,250
Why are you sitting there?

355
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,010
- Because someone called me. <br>- That's your problem.

356
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,070
I'm not sharing this table.

357
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:58,370
That person... did she not come?

358
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,160
She came.

359
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,500
She came, but she doesn't recognize me.

360
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:13,950
Okay. I heard the story, but I feel uncomfortable because I have someone I'm meeting.

361
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,240
My boyfriend is coming.

362
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,670
I looks like you don't have a boyfriend.

363
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:20,750
Was the e-mail sent well? It's urgent.

364
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,750
You had a haircut. I almost didn't recognize you.

365
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,830
- You still don't recognize me. <br>- I did.

366
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,790
But... you were there earlier, weren't you?

367
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,010
I tend to be everywhere and nowhere.

368
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:41,770
Earlier, in front of the broadcasting station, when the temperature was 22℃.

369
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:44,130
I went to see someone.

370
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:49,560
I missed her. Very much.

371
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,120
When I see her, it seems like she would run in my arms.

372
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:01,050
But because I know that those things won't happen, my heart is hurting.

373
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:05,850
But why are you telling that story to me?

374
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,130
You asked.

375
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,010
Aren't you going to order anything?

376
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,140
Enjoy your drink.

377
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,250
Seriously,

378
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,580
how do you not have 5000 won... Why are you at a café?

379
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:30,860
Oh, that's because... my wallet is in my coat, <br>but I was called out before I could pick up my coat.

380
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,480
I'm sorry. I'll drink it well. I'll pay off this debt next time for sure—

381
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,320
There will be no next time. Which way are you going?

382
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,760
Ah, this way.

383
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,520
She should have stayed just a little longer.

384
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:57,360
Could I just have 5,000 won? ($5) So I could pay her back?

385
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,580
Close the door!

386
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,800
How am I supposed to fix this?

387
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,470
I need only 10, 000 won to buy a book.

388
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:32,920
How long has it been since the service guy's supposed to come?

389
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,390
Could I just have 100,000 won? ($100) So I could buy some meat?

390
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,580
Please?

391
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:44,370
I'm sure God had a plan to leave your memory with me.

392
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:49,150
Since you talk to me like that, it makes me feel very awkward.<br> I guess I have to use my last resort.

393
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,570
Don't think of the past and make gold bars appear.

394
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,820
They all have serial numbers so you won't be able to sell them.

395
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:01,090
So confusing. Then is that the only way?

396
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,820
What?

397
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,730
Our security's supposed to be the top. It's very safe. But how did you? Who are you?

398
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:21,330
I am... water, fire, light and dark.

399
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:25,550
To you, I'm Yoo Shin Jae, and Kim Shin to you.

400
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:29,980
Are you the uncle that Grandpa talked about?

401
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,870
That person in Chairman's will.

402
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,980
In Grandpa's will?

403
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:41,380
It's the Chairman's will and the will that's been handed down from your ancestor's ancestors.

404
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:47,510
<i>One day when a person with the last name Kim and name Shin comes</i>

405
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:52,460
<i>and says he's here for his things, give them to him.</i>

406
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:56,540
<i>Everything I left belongs to him.</i>

407
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:01,590
<i>He will walk in rain and leave in blue flame.</i>

408
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,660
<i>Then know he's Kim Shin.</i>

409
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,180
It's a night I miss Chairman Yoo.

410
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:13,590
I don't need the company. Yoo family carved up the company <br>so it cannot be not yours, Deok Hwa.

411
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:18,480
But I need my house, identity, credit card, and nephew.

412
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,390
Following the Chairman's will, I will prepare the house, identity, and credit card.

413
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,570
- The nephew is you. <br> - Umm, but...

414
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,180
If you haven't realized, then it's okay.

415
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,200
What do you mean?

416
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,490
Ji Eun Tak!

417
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:44,500
How did you answer the phone call?<br> Because of your response, the listeners' BBS is going crazy!

418
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,750
I sent the chef's knife set as the prize,

419
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:51,650
but he kept on calling to exchange it to a clothing shop gift card,<br> that the writers couldn't work. What was I supposed to do, then?

420
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:53,240
It's not like we're a clothing company.

421
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,890
Then what are you going to do with the clothing company? Do we pay your check from a money tree?

422
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:03,860
Both the clothing company and the knife company are pulling their ads. What are you going to do?

423
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:09,160
You take responsibility to get sponsors and ads

424
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,800
and make up for it. If you don't, you'll be fired!

425
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,660
- Manager! <br> - What?

426
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:21,550
I will try my best. This is not easy, but I will do it.

427
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,790
That-That... bi...

428
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,810
I got a confession from Sang Hyun today!

429
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:58,630
Really?

430
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:01,340
From the pretty Sang Hyun in the next classroom.

431
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,850
Hurry and reply!

432
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:05,170
Good times.

433
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,550
Why are you smiling?

434
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,130
It's because I find it cute.

435
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,120
I know.

436
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,920
Not them.

437
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,420
But then... aren't you going to give me my 5,000 won?

438
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:29,550
If I don't give it, perhaps will we see each other again? Do you want it now?

439
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,970
I have to go and get it. Payment. You know what I mean, right?

440
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:36,990
I don't.

441
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:40,490
If there is a next time, it means I will be reporting it to the police.

442
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:44,660
I don't know why we keep crossing paths.

443
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,650
Why are you smiling this time?

444
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,290
Because it feels good.

445
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:53,440
Because I can't believe this moment.

446
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,200
Everything is perfect.

447
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,950
What is this? Avoiding is just common sense. Which direction are you going?

448
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:06,480
You're going again.

449
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,120
I will listen to the broadcast well. I'm always listening.

450
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,010
How did you know I work in broadcasting?

451
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,340
It's a bit suspicious at this point. I thought you were an actor last time.

452
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,580
You're not an actor, are you?

453
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,460
I'm sorry but what do you do?

454
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,460
So... that...

455
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:29,100
Over there... that company.

456
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,840
That furniture company? What work do you do there?

457
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:41,060
That is... that... the highest person?

458
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:41,700
Excuse me.

459
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,630
Earlier, you were looking at that company's documents. <br>Give it to me. Those were for ads, right?

460
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:49,700
Give it to me. I will prove to you that I am the highest person in that company.

461
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,180
Originally the staff would be the one to sign this, but the CEO asked me especially.

462
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,190
So that person is the CEO.

463
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,730
Does he work here in the main branch?

464
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,700
He doesn't go to work.

465
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:10,320
Then how should I relay my thanks to him...

466
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,040
To be honest, I don't know his number.

467
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,120
But then, he asked me to sign this kind of document?

468
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,880
Why is that?

469
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,250
So... why would it be?

470
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:28,420
Then, will you please leave your contact information? Then I will give it to him.

471
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:31,200
Thank you.

472
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:37,800
But then... that person's name... I'm a bit strange, right?

473
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,420
It would be if you would get entangled with that person.

474
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,640
His surname is Yoo and his name is Shin Jae.

475
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,690
Yes. Thank you.

476
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:51,450
PD Ji! PD Ji!

477
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,530
So cool!

478
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,480
What happened? How did you get an ad?

479
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,820
I don't know. It feels like I was lured and it seems like a miracle.

480
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,680
Aside from that, I can't explain it.

481
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:09,990
It doesn't matter how. What matters is our program is saved.

482
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,510
You're the best, PD!

483
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:18,130
Now, now. In front of this good energy, let's do well on this new item.

484
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,370
I am looking for a person.

485
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:23,040
I am looking for a person who's picture is inside my phone for 10 years. I am looking for that person I am separated from.

486
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,710
I am looking for the forgotten face and the forgotten memories.

487
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:32,300
If you send in your story, we will introduce the story and get you connected to that person.

488
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,980
It's good.

489
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:39,010
First, look for a picture in your phones and we will have a meeting next.

490
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:43,040
Sincerity, you know? Sincerity. I know at once when I see the story.

491
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,790
Right. Writer Oh knows right away. Work hard.

492
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,250
Yes.

493
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,610
Whose call are you waiting for?

494
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,740
It's not coming.

495
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:15,080
Nice plan. I should find my first love this time.

496
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,530
You should look for that person, Kim Shin.

497
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,270
Should I?

498
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:28,300
But then, that... Is that really your handwriting?

499
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,460
I told you. That's why it's strange.

500
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:37,320
Is it not a ghost? You used to see ghosts in high school.

501
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,630
About 9 years? 10 years?

502
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:44,310
I haven't seen them and now I start to see them again.

503
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,010
Behind your back right now!

504
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,070
Hey!

505
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,750
I'm asking for the napkin.

506
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,090
You're going to die!

507
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,620
What exactly are you?

508
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,760
Why am I your bride?

509
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,310
<i>You are that person's bride.</i>

510
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,290
Who are you?

511
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,200
<i>Uncle!</i>

512
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,290
This came to the address on the first floor of the building that I own.

513
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,700
I'm not sure about an English letter.

514
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,680
It was the chicken store before. I feel strange throwing it away.

515
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,160
<i>Because I have something to do. I don't know when I will be back.</i>

516
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,450
<i>You can wait well, right?</i>

517
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,090
This person can throw it away then.

518
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:50,130
Uncle, your name is Ji Eun Tak?

519
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:54,020
Why do you have so many names, Uncle?

520
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:58,560
You should give it to her. What would I say when I give it to her?

521
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,640
Then I will give it.

522
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,860
Then give it to Sunny and tell her to give it.

523
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:07,690
Whatever happened, they have been living as neighbors <br>since she moved to the rooftop of Sunny's house.

524
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,120
It's just the same. That would be more suspicious.

525
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,550
Me! I am the least awkward. Since I own the building.

526
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:20,690
Now that it is strange. I think it would be better if you would go since you are the strangest.

527
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,600
Me! Me! The Boss there was pretty.

528
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,730
Hello?

529
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:33,710
After 9 years, you now have an excuse.

530
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,320
No, can you uncles not hear me?

531
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,700
Who am I talking to?

532
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:53,890

00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,960

Oh.

538
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,690
She didn't come today, either. What's the matter?

Your boss?

She's not here. What is your name? Should I call her?

00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:47,530
No.

546
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:51,030

I know. What is that?

566
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,410
It did not arrive at the current store but at the old store.

567
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:52,010
The owner of that building left it with a handsome man

568
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,990
and that man brought that,

569
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:57,380
and I checked on the CCTV...

570
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,280
He was really handsome.

571
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,220
At the old store? Where is that?

572
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:06,800
That's why it's strange. It came via international mail.

573
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,430
You have never been to that store, though.

574
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:13,890
It's so strange. He's so handsome to the point that it's strange.

575
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:18,620
What is it? It is my handwriting, though.

576
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:25,020
<i>Mom, hello. My pretty mom who has been always worrying about me.</i>

<i>How is Heaven? Would it be like this place?</i>

578
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:33,330
<i>I am in Canada right now writing you a letter.</i>

579
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:37,720
<i>If you knew how I came here, you would be so surprised.</i>

580
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:42,230
<i>If I cross over through the door, a Heaven-like place such as this would be there.</i>

581
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,480
<i>If I am with Mister, that is.</i>

582
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,680
<i>I now have someone who asks about my well-being.</i>

583
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,220
<i>The things that you don't want me to see,</i>

584
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:55,470
<i>you might be worried and sorry about, but you don't have to now.</i>

585
01:01:55,470 --> 01:02:00,170
<i>Thanks to that, I became special to someone.</i>

586
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:04,930
<i>I am living well, and it will get better.</i>

587
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,630
<i>More than anyone else, I will be happy.</i>

588
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:11,220
<i>Let's meet again. I love you, Mom.</i>

589
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:15,590
<i>From Canada, from Mom's daughter, Eun Tak.</i>

590
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,930
From Canada?

591
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:23,260
I don't even have a passport.

592
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,140
What is this?

593
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,460
This would be so scary.

594
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:53,160
The person. Mister... is he Kim Shin?

595
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:03,180
What on earth happened 9 years ago?

596
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,430
What on earth did I forget?

597
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,110
Hello?

598
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:31,090
<i>This is Yoo Shin Jae.</i>

599
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:37,240
Hello. Wait a moment.

600
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,740
Yes, hello?

601
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,210
Hello?

602
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:54,100
Yes, hello?

603
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:59,550
Hello?

604
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:04,430
Perhaps, were you waiting for my call?

605
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:13,490
I was busy so I forgot that I left my phone number.

606
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:15,720
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

607
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:21,810
My thank you greeting is late but I'm thankful for last time.

608
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,750
Then what about a walk with me?

609
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:27,070
PD Ji, where did you say you live?

610
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:33,570
Me? I never told you where I lived though.

611
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:38,060
So, where do you live?

612
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:46,670
<i>Near Incheon Art Platform.</i>

613
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:48,550
Where near Incheon Art Platform?

614
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:52,710
It's kind of complicated how I live.

615
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,470
CEO, where are you?

616
01:04:55,470 --> 01:05:01,340
I will be going near Incheon Art Platform later. In about 30 minutes.

617
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:08,170
Are you asking me out for a date?

618
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:18,230
Yes. I made up my mind to go on a date with you.

619
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:22,720
Call me if you are near. After about 30 minutes.

620
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:55,050
I also like that scent.

621
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:03,410
This is a scent that women like. You must be good with women's perfume.

622
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:08,110
Do you not like it that I know well about women's perfume?

623
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:11,570
What am I?

624
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:16,890
You are the only woman who knows my number.

625
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,850
Really? Why?

626
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,200
That's a bit strange.

627
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,590
There's nothing strange about it. We just talked on the phone a while ago.

628
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:27,210
Because I had no use for a phone recently.

629
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:31,180
I was in a place where there was no use for a phone. There was just a lot of snow.

630
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,150
Wait a moment.

631
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,880
I keep forgetting. I should take this regularly.

632
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,030
What is that medicine for?

633
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,530
A medicine for a sickness of the heart?

634
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:00,500
Starting when?

635
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,740
The reason... could I ask?

636
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:10,890
Honestly, I don't know when the start was.

637
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:12,530
You can run away.

638
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:16,770
I am being honest so I can give you the chance.

639
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:19,850
I am strange, right?

640
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:23,580
I will show you how I'm more strange.

641
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,220
I am going on a vacation.

642
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:36,530
Just in case you would suddenly come near the Art Platform...

643
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:39,470
I am telling you in advance.

644
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:40,610
Where are you going?

645
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:42,350
Abroad.

646
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,980
It's my first time going abroad so I'm so nervous.

647
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,030
I'm so tacky, aren't I?

648
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,170
You won't be nervous even though it's your first time.

649
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:55,460
You will be very natural as if you didn't come for the first time.

650
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:59,600
You will be like someone who lives there so don't worry.

651
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:04,070
You don't know me well though.

652
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:05,970
Believe me.

653
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:10,630
Now, I'm taking it.

654
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:13,570
One, two...

655
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:27,430
No matter how I think about it, there must be something there. So I'm going to find out.

656
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:29,390
What is there?

657
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:31,340
I am going because I don't know.

658
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,840
Right. If you don't know you should go and ask.

659
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:37,010
While you're a year younger, go and ask.

660
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:42,520
You know if you wear a hoodie when you go abroad, <br>you'll get in trouble with international law, right?

661
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,710
Yes.

662
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:48,360
Let's match your TPO. It's your first trip abroad after all.

663
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,510
Yes.

664
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:55,940
But then, you earned a lot of money since your business boomed.

665
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,290
Why aren't you moving?

666
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:00,870
PD Ji, you didn't know? This building is mine. I bought it.

667
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,830
Why wouldn't I know? You told me over 100 times already.

668
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:07,360
I'm asking why you are not moving.

669
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:11,540
A new house is bothersome. And I have a fear of new houses.

670
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,220
I don't mean it that way.

671
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,710
You didn't? The tangerines are delicious.

672
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:19,210
They are really delicious.

673
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:34,210
Excuse me. I have received this letter. It is from this hotel.

674
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:40,670
It is right, we sent it.

675
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,270
Ah, you're Korean. That's a relief.

676
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:47,170
The owner of this hotel is also Korean.

677
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:49,980
Ah, yes.

678
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:53,330
There was a development construction

679
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:56,130
and there were a few letters found inside.

680
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:58,820
Though it's a first that a 10-year-old letter was found.

681
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:00,550
How did you know it was 10 years ago?

682
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:03,350
The design of the envelop is from 10 years ago.

683
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:07,530
It must be a precious memory. We are sorry it came late.

684
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:15,360
It's okay. There must be a reason for it to come in late.

685
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:19,520
God has a reason for each step...

686
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:27,360
Someone probably said that?

687
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:50,260
Nice.

700
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,550
Today is really strange.

701
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:38,870
How could we bump into each other here?

702
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:39,990
I am in the middle of a business trip.

703
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:44,900
For the furniture edge, that... style reference. I need it.

704
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,830
What are you saying?

705
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,550
Have you been well?

706
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:57,590
Perhaps, did you follow me?

707
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:59,570
If I did, will I be taken away?

708
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:00,490
What should I do?

709
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:01,460
I'm not a bad person.

710
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:02,470
How would I know that?

711
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:03,920
Won't you know the more we go together?

712
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,140
I don't have a reason for us to go together though.

713
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:09,930
Our company sponsored your program and last time you said <br>you would be treating me for a meal.

714
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:17,390
CEO, it's your first time in Canada, right? Then, let's head this way.

726
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,720

730
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:34,320
<i>I give one vote that there is one.</i>

731
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,630
<i>Which side are you betting on?</i>

732
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:37,230
