♬ <i> Which made everyone pass by me <i> ♬</i></i>

8
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:52,190
Then what am I now? Am I still not the Goblin's bride?

9
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,390
Am I not?

10
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,350
I think you are.

11
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,040
Really?

12
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,870
Then... do I get the effective value now?

13
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,190
Will you not leave now?

14
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,110
For now.

15
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,340
I might prepare to leave somewhere further.

16
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,610
What does that mean?

17
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,430
It means you're the Goblin's bride.

18
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,860
I don't think that's what you meant.

19
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,190
You've been seeing it from the beginning, so why did you pretend not to see it all this time?

20
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,460
At first, as courtesy, then because I was scared.

21
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,210
In detail.

22
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,650
I thought it was not courteous to ask something painful to someone I just met.

23
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,790
And after that, if I say that I see it, I was scared that something might happen.

24
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,790
"What if he asks me to get married right away?"

25
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,310
"What about my college? Would I become a goblin?"

26
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,500
Above that, I wondered if you had money.

27
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,600
Pretending not to see it came after those. Because I got mad. It was for a short time.

28
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,680
What do I need to do now? As a bride.

29
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:29,120
The first thing you need to do as a bride... Wait here for now.

30
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,530
<i>- Episode 4 -</i>

31
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,200
She sees the sword. She just pointed to it. Like this.

32
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,770
Alright. So leave.

33
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,890
She sees the sword. She's my bride! I'm going to die now!

34
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,660
So what? Isn't that good?

35
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,540
Weren't you looking for your bride to die? The bride that would return you to nothing?

36
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,490
That's right. For most of my life.

37
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,140
Then what is the problem? Why? She wants to kill you?

38
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,560
I'm not in the mood for jokes!

39
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,390
What exactly are you feeling? Are you happy because she sees the sword or are you afraid?

40
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,670
I don't know. A part of me thinks that it's a relief that I can end this tiring immortal life.

41
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,950
Then it wasn't always that tiring so I feel like living a little more.

42
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,180
Just say it. I can take her anytime.

43
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,150
She's someone I have to take anyway.

44
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,010
Even though, I would have to stay up for nights to get the documents ready.

45
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,220
- Did it sound like that?<br>- Yeah.

46
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,910
You're right on point. I'm glad we finally have a friendship.

47
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,340
Death is calling me.

48
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,060
If it's ringing the doorbell then it's a friendly death.

49
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,060
Calm down. You didn't say anything mean to her that she would hold a grudge, right?

50
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,380
<i>One way is to die according to your actual life</i>,

51
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,310
<i>since this is a bonus life, like a side effect.</i>

52
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,350
I'll just die. That's simpler.

53
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,760
Right. Let's do that.

54
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,390
You can't even wait for that short while I told you, too? You really have no patience.

55
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,630
<i>Go harder. You only die once.</i>

56
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,810
I'm sorry but I can't wait any longer.

57
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,130
After I found out that I am the Goblin's bride, I have been waiting only for you.

58
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,460
For a long time.

59
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,090
My aunt left the house and she also took the house deposit.

60
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,400
Therefore, I have no house to live in.

61
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,340
So, since you said that you will not be leaving--

62
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,960
Did you really decide not to leave?

63
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,770
I will grow in this house.

64
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,970
Adoption is fine, too. I will grow like a cactus.

65
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,410
I will grow well by myself. Please.

66
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,210
I approve.

67
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:41,560
I want to be an ordinary senior high school student in Korea taking the college entrance exam, but

68
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,900
I lost my mother when I was nine and I didn't have anyone to rely on.

69
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,920
I know this story. I saw that drama.

70
00:05:52,030 --> 00:06:00,630
Without a mother... Under the sky with no mother, being abused by my aunt and her children for the past 10 years...

71
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,480
I wish it ended with a happy ending.

72
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,190
Then I finally realized, "There is no god."

73
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,960
While in this hodgepodge world filled with all sorts of misfortune,

74
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,620
I met you. Just like fate.

75
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,960
So, save me. Please.

76
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,460
Hey, you're asking me to save you but you want to live here after you've seen who lives here?

77
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,550
If it's not this house, I'll die wandering in the streets or from starvation.

78
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,960
If I die here or there, I would rather die beautifully in this house.

79
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,650
They say the darkest place is under a lamp. Starting from today, be my lamp

80
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,370
so that this ahjussi can't get me.

81
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,300
I'm sorry but between us our friendsh--

82
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,000
Go inside for now.

83
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,250
Stay in the living room. Don't misbehave.

84
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,960
Yes.

85
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,760
See me for a moment.

86
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,990
How could a friendship not go on for 5 minutes? How could you tell her that?

87
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,530
- Ah! You asking me to take her is supposed to be a secret? I didn't know.<br>- You did it on purpose, didn't you?

88
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,540
To a kid who has no place to go and is really pitiable.

89
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,950
Ah, is that why you made her stand outside when it was cold?

90
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,020
Don't ever come out.

91
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,950
What will you do? Do you have a way?

92
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,160
There is a way. Although it's a bit secular.

93
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,940
Among 1, 2, 3, I pick 2. Here is $5000.

94
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,720
Why are you looking at me like that?

95
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,980
What does that mean?

96
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,180
This money... keep it.

97
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,030
I, who said that, was the one who didn't know what was what.

98
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:19,260
Now, I've seen this house.

99
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,640
So what does that mean?

100
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
This house is perfect for raising kids.

101
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,220
Let's have kids and live a good lovey-dovey life.

102
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,150
What type are you?

103
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,270
W-What?

104
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,140
What type of wife do you prefer? A good wife and wise mother? Sexy?

105
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,080
A professional? Should I change it up every day?

106
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,820
You said I was no good, that I was really no good!

107
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,770
I was saying all sorts of things. Cancel.

108
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,600
<i>Ahjussi, you are really handsome. You are really cool.</i>

109
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,110
<i>Ever since I met you I never look at stars.</i>

110
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,010
<i>Why would I look at the stars? I could just look at your eyes.</i>

111
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,490
<i>Ahjussi, do you hear my loud thoughts?</i>

112
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,600
What are you doing?

113
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,470
I know you heard it all.

114
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,030
I'm sorry. I keep on thinking to myself loudly.

115
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,560
I lied about that.

116
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,800
A lie? You said you could hear my thoughts.

117
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,050
That lie started there.

118
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,640
Then that time when I was abducted, how did you know?

119
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,740
I just felt it. I don't know exactly but it seems to be because of the mark on your neck.

120
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,140
Scammer. In case my thoughts get caught, I really thought of you quietly.

121
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,630
I did it in parts. I did it while singing in between, even while looking at the leaf,

122
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,550
"I'm not thinking of Mister, I'm thinking of autumn foliage."

123
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,120
I made excuses like that. I was even cautious when I thought about myself.

124
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,650
Why? What?

125
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:55,170
Why are you confessing about thinking about me, making me all confused.

126
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,740
What makes you confused? I really am the bride.

127
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,800
So... should I unpack or not? I'm also confused.

128
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,130
It seems like you are not confused though. Put down the money and don't unpack your things.

129
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,680
Is there a number 4, by any chance?

130
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,320
It must be something better, right?

131
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,760
<i>Grandpa!</i>

132
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,850
- Huh?<br>- Oh!

133
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,720
Why is she here, Grandpa? Why are you here with her?

134
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,510
He's the grandson that I was talking about.

135
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,930
He'll be living a floor below you so

136
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,610
if you have something you need, you can just ask him.

137
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,710
Me? Me?

138
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,200
Hey, there are a lot of people in your secretary's office.

139
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,000
Do you not want your card usage released?

140
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,570
Among them, I'm most competent so I will assist you.

141
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,780
I am Yoo Deok Hwa.

142
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,100
As you can see he's not so trustworthy.

143
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,080
If something unfavorable happens,

144
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,540
please call here.

145
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,080
Thank you.

146
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,430
<i>[Yoo San Woo, CEO]</i>

147
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,530
Are you the Chairman?

148
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:27,120
The Chairman and his biological grandson, third generation chaebol.

149
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,070
You must be tired. I will be taking him as I go out.

150
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,140
Why? I have something to talk to her about.

151
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,000
Grandpa! Grandpa!

152
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,630
Goodbye.

153
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,970
Suite Room.

154
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,140
Wow!

155
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,900
Ah, so nice.

156
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,790
Feels nice.

157
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,070
So this is a suite room.

158
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,260
It's a nice suite room but I'm by myself.

159
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,880
It's so spacious.

160
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,210
It's scary to be by myself.

161
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,350
Grandpa, who is she?

162
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,860
You don't need to know.

163
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,190
Just mind assisting her to be comfortable.

164
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,290
Something really important relies on her.

165
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,190
Something important? What?

166
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,130
Your card.

167
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,130
So unbelievable.

168
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,110
I'm the chaebol.

169
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,640
Why is my card usage in the hands of a high schooler?

170
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,740
Seriously.

171
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,210
Uncle! Uncle! Grandpa has some young girl...

172
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,180
Uncle, what's wrong? What's going on?

173
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,840
This medicine is for my nerves. This is for bipolar disorder. This is for insomnia.

174
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,680
So, I'm asking why are you taking them?

175
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,220
I am really fickle these days, happy, sad, lonely, splendid...

176
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't sleep.

177
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,160
Why are you lonely then splendid?

178
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,250
I lost weight.

179
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,240
That man... my uncle... What on earth...

180
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,620
Uncle, what's wrong?

181
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,810
I have the same symptoms. If I shed a tear after seeing a woman for the first time,

182
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,310
what could that be?

183
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,450
<i>Hello, viewers. Today we have a family medicine specialist with us.</i>

184
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,720
<i>We will spend time learning about mental health.</i>

185
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,730
<i>Yes. Physical health is important but compared to that, many people </i>

186
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,570
<i>overlook their mental health.</i>

187
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,260
<i>Bipolar disorder and insomnia due to nervous exhaustion</i>

188
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,710
<i>are chronic illnesses that stick to modern day people like a shadow.</i>

189
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,270
<i>First, a sign of bipolar disorder</i>

190
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,270
<i>is impulsive shopping.</i>

191
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,990
<i>If a person close to you suddenly buys many items, be suspicious.</i>

192
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,680
<i>Other symptoms include...</i>

193
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,540
<i>excessive self-confidence.</i>

194
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,220
Anyone want to go to the sauna with me?

195
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,610
Forget it if you don't have the confidence.

196
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,210
Wow, he's really excessive.

197
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,680
Uncle, let's tie him up.

198
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,010
Challenge accepted.

199
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,350
<i>One of the representative symptom of nervous exhaustion is hypochondria.</i>

200
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,000
I think the reason I have heartburn is because I have a stomach ulcer.

201
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,540
At least give me that.

202
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,330
You won't die by not having a stomach. You just won't be able to eat.

203
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,100
You said you'll die when your bride pulls out the sword.

204
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,300
Ah, so you're telling me to die?

205
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,010
- That was all we talked about. <br>- What's news?

206
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,030
If someone overheard, they'd think that I'm the only weird one. Only I'm small-minded. Someone like me doesn't have the worth to live.

207
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,880
Why don't you go to her and tell her!

208
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,550
To pull the sword and kill me! That I deserve to die!

209
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,790
- You look like you'll cry. Really.<br>- I'm barely keeping it in.

210
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,130
Is the bus stop this way?

211
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,920
Or that way?

212
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,720
Is Mister depressed?

213
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,890
But it's funny.

214
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,310
You'll hurt my feelings if you're depressed now.

215
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:19,110
If you don't like it, just say so! What's with the rain during commute time that causes everybody discomfort?

216
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,180
Hello.

217
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,930
I'll escort you to school. Please get in.

218
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,750
Please drop the formal speech.

219
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,530
No, I don't want to

220
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,250
because I'm afraid you might tell my grandfather.

221
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,300
I won't tell him.

222
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,650
Even if you don't tell him, someone will.

223
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:06,390

226
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,290
What are you doing? Get off, we're here.

227
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,680
I told you not here. Over there by the 4-way intersection.

228
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,570
Absolutely never.

229
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:31,560
It's natural for a chaebol to drive a sedan in front of the school to gather attention.

230
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,360
If you don't get off, I'll do it again tomorrow.

231
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,360
- You're really not going to do it tomorrow?<br> - Tomorrow wouldn't be fun.

232
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,200
I've already drawn all their attention.

233
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,780
Isn't that Ji Eun Tak?

234
00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:00,230
Hey!

235
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,800
- Please go.<br>- You're Ji Eun Tak?

236
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,410
Yes. I was late introducing myself, wasn't I? I'm Ji Eun Tak-

237
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,990
Then you're that shabashaba eyeshaba...You cried a lot, didn't you?

238
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,170
Then, that time, that goblin book...

239
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,020
Ah, so you know my uncle?

240
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,230
All the pieces of the puzzle have come together.

241
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,250
- Uncle?<br>- Ah! What happened to your aunt?

242
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,390
That punishment (beol)? That gold (geum)? I mean that punishment (beol).

243
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,660
A fine (beolgeum)?

244
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,620
Is my aunt paying some kind of fine?

245
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:42,350
I don't know. I'm just curious about how he carried out her punishment.

246
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,050
Where did you get this?

247
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,580
Why are you asking that kind of question?

248
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,590
Do you want to buy it or not?

249
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,410
It's because this is very high quality, that's why.

250
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,630
I received it as an inheritance. An inheritance.

251
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,370
- What's wrong with your face?<br>- My mom hit me. Since I'm pitiful, so please give us a good offer.

252
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,550
- You crazy...<br>- She hasn't been beaten enough. She needs a thorough beating.

253
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,070
Shut up!

254
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:34,310
One moment. This is a precious item so I have to properly appraise it with some equipment.

255
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,040
<i>[Soo Jewels]</i><br><i>[Gold . Silver . Jewels . Watches]</i>

256
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,000
Why are you hitting me?

257
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,240
- Just get out.<br>- Keep your mouth shut, girl! You're embarrassing me!

258
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,700
<i>What do you mean by stealing?</i>

259
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,710
Stolen?

260
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,730
I said I brought this from my niece's drawer! How many times do I have to tell you?

261
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,270
- That's stealing, Mom.<br>- Shut up, punk.

262
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,300
You were the most thrilled. This punk was.

263
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,900
Sit.

264
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,220
- So this gold is your niece's?<br>- Yes.

265
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,200
Why did you lie to the jeweler saying they were an inheritance?

266
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,220
How did I lie?

267
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,060
I never said it was inherited by me but it was inherited by my niece.

268
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,220
Her mom, so, as my sister was dying--

269
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,490
Yes. That's enough.

270
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,270
I got it. What's your niece's name and birthday?

271
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:35,930
She's in high school. She's a senior. Her name is--

272
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,270
What was her name again? What was it?

273
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,870
- Eun Ji?<br>- Eun Hee?

274
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,710
Ah, these crazy punks. Are you going to come to your senses?

275
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,160
Do you think this is a joke?

276
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,070
Listen carefully. So,

277
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,000
your niece in high school whose name you don't know,

278
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,180
stole these gold bars made by the bank of Korea and which should be kept in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

279
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,170
And you stole these again. Isn't that what you're saying?

280
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,960
No, it's not that we stole them!

281
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,910
Ah, if you can't believe me, go to our home and ask her yourself!

282
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,250
I've been asking you the whole time.The address, give me the address.

283
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,500
The address is Seongbuk-gu, Seoul.

284
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,780
Wait. Seongbuk-gu, Seoul...

285
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,820
Seongbuk-gu, Seoul...

286
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,250
What was it?

287
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,420
What was our home's address?

288
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,240
We had a home?

289
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,730
We lived somewhere?

290
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,370
These crazy people. What is this?

291
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,580
Is she really Uncle's bride?

292
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,380
Why is she his bride?

293
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,900
Who knows. Probably god's joke.

294
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,300
Ah. That's why Uncle is depressed.

295
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,650
She's not his style.

296
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,860
God's joke went a bit far.

297
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,950
But, Uncle down the hall, my Uncle cherishes that plate very much. The one you just froze.

298
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,350
Uncle said he bought that himself from Louis the 14th.

299
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,290
- That's what he said.<br>- Deok Hwa.

300
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:28,420
I won't tell on you.

301
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,200
Is it because of that girl? The girl who brought tears to your eyes the first time you met her?

302
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,320
Think carefully. Are you sure that was your first meeting?

303
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,200
That's not what a man should do. Take responsibility.

304
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,660
Even if you don't, that girl might remember something.

305
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,110
- But...<br>- Yes?

306
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:50,620
- She was too carefree.<br><i>- I'm Sunny.</i>

307
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,540
She did this to her hair.

308
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,390
She flipped it like that. And her lips.

309
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,010
She did this.

310
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,870
Like this? What?

311
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,520
I really never met her before.

312
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,270
Why would you not finish your sentence?

313
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,830
Ah, what did she do with her lips?

314
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,310
I won't ask.

315
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,340
Oh my, look at the time.

316
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:36,690
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

317
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,400
Why are you suited all up? Is it a marriage or funeral?

318
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,270
Ah, is this why they say marriage is a tomb?

319
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,840
I'm a little reverent right now.

320
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,230
I wish that you would answer honestly to the questions I ask.

321
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:52,110
You also do international work, don't you? Or is your English too limited?

322
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,060
What? Pardon?

323
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,720
That's good enough. Unfortunately, I need your help.

324
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,680
Why? Are you going to die abroad?

325
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,090
He's too mean.

326
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,070
Why is he avoiding me?

327
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,480
Why aren't you coming?

328
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,030
Why aren't you contacting me?

329
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,620
Open the door! I'm in front of your house! Why are you avoiding me?

330
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,990
Come out! I know you're inside!

331
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,100
You're not coming out?

332
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,380
If you don't come out, I'm going to blow this out!

333
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,180
Do you know what this is? It's a very long and big candle.

334
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,960
I'm going to blow it out. I can't assure you where I'll do it.

335
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,240
I'll summon you at a place where you'll be embarrassed.

337
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,850
How long do I have to wait for now?

338
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:57,010
- It's been a while.<br>- You haven't aged at all.

339
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,890
I told you 4 was the answer to problem #17, but you still wrote down 2.

340
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:13,860
No matter how much I solved it, it turned out to be 2. Even though I knew the correct answer.

341
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,290
So I couldn't write down 4.

342
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,280
That was a problem I couldn't solve.

343
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,750
No. You solved it very well.

344
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,660
In your life, only your decisions are the correct answer.

345
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,440
Ah. It was that kind of problem.

346
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,600
I see you became a lawyer. You helped a lot of people in need.

347
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,980
I wanted to pay you back for the sandwich you gave me then.

348
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,710
And I didn't have any other choices.

349
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,930
I knew you were there.

350
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:54,740
Ordinary people don't forget miraculous moments.

351
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,350
I know.

352
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,240
I gave thousands of people sandwiches.

353
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,190
But it's rare to see someone who progressed like you.

354
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,940
Ordinary people stay in that miraculous moment and ask for another moment of assistance.

355
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,470
"I know you're there."

356
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,760
As if they left their miracles up to me.

357
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,300
You changed your own life.

358
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,720
For that reason, I have always cheered you on.

359
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,000
I knew you would do that.

360
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,320
Where am I going now?

361
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,850
You can leave through the door you came through.

362
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,830
Afterlife is on the other side.

363
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,080
It's obvious that he's going to a nice place.

364
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,970
I guess. Thanks for today.

365
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,780
Why do you bother doing this?

366
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,530
You don't have to do it. No one's asking you to.

367
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,500
I don't need to. But if I don't work, I'm not cool.

368
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,590
Sure, of course.

369
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,470
Where were you? You were not at home.

370
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,210
Did you come to my house?

371
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,810
Why do you avoid me?

372
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,330
Not avoid... I was busy?

373
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:33,040
You were busy avoiding me. As far as I know, you don't even have a job.

374
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,070
Otherwise, was I a girl who was

375
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,770
- abandoned by her husband? <br>- What?

376
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,320
Then what?

377
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,760
You avoid me because you're a goblin, then avoid me because you're not. You avoid me because I don't see the sword, then you avoid me because I see the sword.

378
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,510
Really petty! Petty!

379
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,960
Try to run away, I will blow all this.

380
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,020
Really pretty.

381
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,300
I am really serious now.

382
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,150
Me, too.

383
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,870
You don't have money but where did you buy all these candles?

384
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,100
Yoo Duk Hwa Oppa.

385
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,070
This jerk.

386
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,820
Can't I just live at your house? You have plenty of vacant rooms.

387
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,290
How do you know the rooms are empty or not?

388
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,400
- Yoo Duk Hwa Oppa.<br> - This jerk...

389
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:21,590
You said "wait for now." "For now" usually means about an hour to half a day, at most.

390
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:26,600
But how many days passed? In the meantime, it rained. Because of me, were you sad?

391
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,630
No.

392
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,860
You can tell me.

393
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,520
I've been preparing myself these past few days. I'm determined to take in whatever you say.

394
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,980
Why are you getting determined?

395
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,410
I'm the one who should be determined.

396
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,420
What, determined?

397
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,210
You do not need to know.

398
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,610
Did you have dinner?

399
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,760
Why? Did you already eat.

400
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,850
Now that you know that I can see the sword, I can't see you.

401
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,430
I didn't tell you so you'd be like this.

402
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,410
What kind of determination do you have to make? Don't do it alone but let's do it together!

403
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,600
Do you want some steak? Should I order room service?

404
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,830
Looking at you, changing the subject... I am going to let it go.

405
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,780
I don't feel like beef today. Let's eat something else.

406
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:38,930
All the expensive things in the room were enticing me but I didn't give in.

407
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,730
This is it.

408
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,730
Will that be enough?

409
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,220
Choose anything that you want.

410
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:53,210
I can buy you everything from here to there.

411
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,780
In a single payment.

412
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,350
Stand up straight. How can two cans of beer make you like this?

413
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,510
Should I buy you toothbrushes? From here to here.

414
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,980
Ta-dah!

415
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:17,560
Extra fine brushes.

416
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,600
Can you please just go. Go.

417
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,760
I don't want to. I will take you home.

418
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,260
Am I really your bride?

419
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,440
Yeah.

420
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,060
Then I can't meet with another man?

421
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,700
I don't want to recommend it.

422
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,810
Then what are you going to do about my third wish?

423
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,860
Part-time job, my aunt's family, boyfriend. Boyfriend!

424
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:58,440
In this lifetime, that will never happen. Don't put your hopes up.

425
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,770
Why?

426
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,100
Because I don't like it.

427
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,830
Where is there such a thing? Do you like me?

428
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,930
No.

429
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,200
Your "no" isn't necessarily a no.

430
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,250
How did you live until now? Doing what?

431
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,990
I lived waiting for you.

432
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,460
Be quiet.

433
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,580
I said it quietly.

434
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,920
Then, if you're depressed it rains. What happens when you feel good?

435
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,010
Pass.

436
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,840
Don't tell me flowers are going to bloom or something.

437
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,290
No. Next question.

438
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,470
- Can you fly?<br>- That's a piece of cake.

439
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,660
Show me next time.

440
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,320
I will.

441
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,540
About me... What place bride am I?

442
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,230
You're the first and last.

443
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,740
Let's say it's the first but how do you know it'll be the last?

444
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,490
Because I've decided it to be.

445
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,530
What if... I decided not to be your bride, what happens?

446
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,630
Ahh...

447
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,730
Then this sword won't get pulled out.

448
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,330
Only you can do it. You need to take this sword out for me...

449
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,520
for me...

450
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,290
to be pretty. I'm not pretty now.

451
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,150
Ahhh. Is it that?

452
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:22,320
In fairy tales, the cursed prince meets his true love and turns back to himself. That?

453
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,000
In The Frog Prince, from frog to prince. In The Beauty and the Beast, from beast to prince.

454
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,190
For a goblin, from a goblin to a broo...

455
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,960
Let's pull it out some other time. At the moment, when we need a broom.

456
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:44,300
You have no idea. I'm the crazy one for laughing at this situation.

457
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,100
Fine. Some other time, then.

458
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:58,420
Not today. Tonight, just let me laugh with you.

459
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,840
When the first snow comes?

460
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,060
First snow?

461
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,470
You need a broom then.

462
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,490
When the first snow comes.

463
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:24,860
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

464
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,650
When will the first snow come this year?

465
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,790
<i>It looks good, really.</i>

466
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,370
<i>Let's take it together.</i>

467
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,280
What's that?

468
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,210
Something good must have happened last night.

469
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,140
In this autumn, and in a matter of a day, flowers this big are just

470
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,850
crazily... blooming beautifully.

471
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:18,900
Rain and snow can be explained as a change in weather. What will you do about the flowers? You drank, didn't you?

472
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:24,770
"What are you going to do about the flowers?" "Flowers" "Uncle you drank, right?" All those three things you said informally.

473
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,260
Should we just comfortably be brothers?

474
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,490
- Should we? Hyung, what did you do last ni-<br>- You insolent...

475
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,830
Just say that you don't remember!

476
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,280
What are you going to do?

477
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,930
It's not because of the alcohol but because of the antidepressant. It's time for me to stop taking...

478
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,620
Why are you suddenly lowering your voice?

479
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,050
You won't even know if I tell you.

480
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,370
What is this?

481
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,630
It's a vacant seat. Let's sit there.

482
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,390
- How could we meet in a place like this?<br>- Who?

483
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:11,050
It's the last episode. I can't miss the last episode of the morning drama.

484
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:16,070
<i>Everyone lives with at least a wound in their hearts.</i>

485
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,540
<i>Wound? Do you even know what that is?</i>

486
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,890
<i>Death is the only way I'll leave you.</i>

487
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,900
I asked you to buy snacks last night, right?

488
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,020
No.

489
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,200
Don't think lightly but think properly.

490
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,600
Just wake up from your hangover.

491
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,390
You can't remember? With two cans of beer?

492
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,770
It's not because of alcohol but because of the medicine.

493
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,100
Uncle, what's wrong with you? You're scaring me.

494
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,380
Is there something there?

495
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,700
<i>Eun Bi is Hye Jin's daughter.</i>

496
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,400
<i>What?</i>

497
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,690
Holy cow!

498
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,390
She's her daughter?

499
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,670
Oh my! I really didn't know!

500
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,680
You're going home, right?

501
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,090
Are you finally surprised that Eun Bi is Hye Jin's daughter?

502
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,400
What is this? What kind of memory is this?

503
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,250
What is? What is it?

504
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:28,570
<i>What if... I said I wasn't going to be the bride. What would happen?</i>

505
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,800
<i>This sword can't be pulled out. Only you can pull it out.</i>

506
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,490
Ah, you crazy goblin! Agh!

507
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,380
- What should I do?<br>- Why? What's the matter?

508
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,500
I told her about taking out the sword!

509
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,370
Uncle, what are you looking at? Are you ill?

510
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:50,670
Since it turned out like this, I think it's for the better. It's good even if you die now.

511
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:55,030
Just try talking like that. I'll burn your hat down!

512
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,390
I don't know him. He's a stranger. A total stranger.

513
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:04,130
Work hard. I'm going first.

514
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,860
Ah, Uncle, what's the matter with you?

515
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:12,170
Who are you? Do you know me?

516
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,730
Uncle! Wow, during that ruckus, he heard that?

517
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,880
Uncle!

518
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,780
Even if you smear crap all over your face, it'll be pretty!

519
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,620
It's all in the past. "If you cherish it, it becomes poop."

520
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,730
What are you talking about? It's still fine. It's okay.

521
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:47,750
Unni, what's that shadow? It's so pigmented.

522
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,910
Please give me one of those.

523
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,170
Yes. Please come this way.

524
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,230
I got you a purchase.

525
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,840
Thanks.

526
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,110
Do you have an appointment today? Where are you going, looking so pretty?

527
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,920
Perhaps, did you get a boyfriend?

528
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,240
I'm looking pretty and waiting for a call so I can get one.

529
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,720
But it's not coming. Why is that?

530
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,730
He must be pushing and pulling with you.<br> <i>(Playing hard to get)</i>

531
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:15,330
Did he get pushed? But I pulled.

532
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:32,760
But, owner, why do you always look out the window? Is there something out there?

533
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,250
I'm waiting.

534
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,450
For what?

535
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:42,750
I don't know. I'm always just waiting for someone.

536
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,340
A customer?

537
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,680
No. Sir.

538
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,310
A prince charming on a white horse?

539
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,220
I don't like younger men.

540
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,670
Since it came to this, it would be better if it's a king on a white horse.

541
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:07,710
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

542
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,390
You're the only one without a name on the tombstone.

543
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,470
<i>[Yoo Jeong Woo]<br> [Don't bother this Goryeo person's rest]</i>

544

<i>[Yoo Seo Won]<br> [I hope the dirt over you is light]</i>

545
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,270
What is it? Did you pick it up?

546
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,220
Someone gave it to me. Hand it over.

547
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:44,010
Who did? That man who drove you this morning or that old man in front of your house?

548
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,290
You are really so diverse.

549
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,460
Do you know what this name card is before saying things?

550
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,900
It's written on there. Chairman of Yoo Shin.

551
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,460
Exactly. He's deceiving you, dumbass.

552
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,530
Did that man tell you he's close with the Chairman?

553
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:02,080
Let her be. As if she would be scared.

554
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,860
Why?

555
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,490
What?

556
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,200
Aren't you going to look down?

557
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,240
What is this?

558
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,700
What is this cigarette?

559
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,740
Right. It's your first time seeing a cigarette, right?

560
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,240
You must be crazy!

561
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,910
In the school. Even more, in the classroom.

562
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:33,300
Teacher. No.

563
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,310
Hey, hand me a lighter.

564
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,490
What did I just say?

565
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,320
Lighter? You really won't do.

566
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,000
Come out. Follow me.

567
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,380
Teacher, no. This isn't mine. This is Ji Eun Tak's!

568
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,790
She was going to smoke it, so I took it from her! Search her. I said this was Ji Eun Tak's!

569
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:58,200
Hey, Park Seo Jin. That is yours.

570
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,840
Ji Eun Tak doesn't even smoke. Just stop.

571
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,160
Hey, class president, are you crazy? Do you want to die?

572
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,790
You are the one who wants to die. You. You know where the faculty office is, right? Go.

573
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,340
Go.

574
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,620
Straight.

575
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:36,510
Revenge on the girl that bullied you. Blood revenge.

576
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,750
I did it.

577
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:43,260
That bitch was so mean. That feels so refreshing.

578
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,850
Hey! You say you're lonely. Why don't you take her with you?

579
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:49,380
How could you say mean things? I wouldn't take that girl if I was dead—

580
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,250
You are dead...

581
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,000
If I wake up from the dead, I wouldn't take her, Grandma.

582
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,130
We did well, right?

583
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:55,980
Hey.

584
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,070
I put the cigarette...

585
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:04,220
Thank you, everyone.

586
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,880
I did it.

587
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,950
We'll be going first.

588
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,290
Why? What?

589
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:21,260
♫ <i>How can I get over you?</i> ♫

590
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:44,280
I thought you said you don't go around in cars.

591
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,090
I'm just bragging about my car.

592
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:49,600
- Do you have a license? <br>- What do you take me for?

593
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,550
I took you for a drunkard last night.

594
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,670
Yesterday, I didn't make any mistakes, right?

595
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,960
You don't remember?

596
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,030
Can't you see that I regretfully remember everything?

597
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,530
Have you had hangover soup? Aren't you hungry?

598
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:10,590
Why do you ask me whenever you see me? Can't you eat before seeing me?

599
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:15,600
It's because I want to eat with you. If you don't want to, then don't.

600
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,860
What do you want to eat together? Beef?

601
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:22,790
Beef? I haven't even thought of it and I think it's such a good idea.

602
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,860
Stay here for a while.

603
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,350
We're here. Get off.

604
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,760
This is my way of saying thanks for the maple leaf.

605
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,010
Awesome. You took me to the maple nation for giving you a maple leaf.

606
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,200
Mister, is this a honeymoon?

607
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,520
Get back in. Let's go back.

608
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,860
No. Let's go this way. I know Quebec well.

609
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,510
As if you know. Beef is this way.

610
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:10,090
Huh? What did you say?

611
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,350
Thank you for the meal.

612
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,290
There's a lot of swords.

613
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,620
Put that down and talk.

614
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,210
Look at him all scared.

615
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,780
Eat. I thought you were hungry.

616
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,870
Yes.

617
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:41,750
Then... as you eat, listen to what I say without any misunderstandings.

618
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:44,610
It's because I am really curious.

619
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:53,030
This sword, what does the handle look like?

620
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:57,650
Are you doubting me?

621
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,220
Why are you getting mad? I'm just the cautious type to make certain about these kinds of things.

622
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,530
That's called doubting.

623
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:14,160
The handle... there's a tiger.

624
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,300
Right? A white tiger. It's really cool, isn't it?

625
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,320
Of course.

626
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:27,800
But then, I found out more about you.

627
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,460
But no matter how hard I look, I couldn't find anything about that.

628
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,230
What about?

629
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:34,830
About being stabbed with a sword.

630
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,630
Why did that happen? Did you do it yourself? Others?

631
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:42,980
By someone who I never thought would do it to me.

632
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,300
It's a really painful story.

633
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,150
Then, nevermind. What about your age? How old exactly are you?

634
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,190
939 years old.

635
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,460
I see it's a more painful story. I'm sorry.

636
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,620
But still... it must be nice to live so long.

637
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:17,720
You don't age, you have a lot of money, and you meet your bride like this.

638
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:22,900
Do you want to live long? Even if you're the only one that's staying the same and everything else flows?

639
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,370
I have you, though.

640
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:30,570
Since you will always be there so I think living long would be okay.

641
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:46,920
You're awfully cheerful for someone who has such a traumatic story.

642
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:52,920
It's been almost a thousand years. I can't be sad for a thousand years.

643
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,530
I'm just an energetic goblin who humbly accepts his fate and lives cheerfully.

644
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,720
Where would you find sadness that goes on for thousands of years?

645
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,880
Where would you find a love that goes on for thousands of years?

646
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,110
I give one vote that there is one.

647
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:17,820
Which side are you going to put it on? On sadness or love?

648
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,610
A sad love?

649
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,170
If you don't believe me, should we have a bet?

650
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:29,920
What bet? How far did you research? What else do you know?

651
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,120
You have lived alone for a long time, you are very lonely,

652
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,850
fickle, ill-tempered, like dark and humid places...

653
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:39,110
You researched mainly on bad things...

654
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,790
You bring good fortune and misfortune to people,

655
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,870
and you don't have a family.

656
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:47,060
Maybe that's why you left me alone in the hotel.

657
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,040
I was taking appropriate measures. You should think about it yourself.

658
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,560
What thoughts?

659
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,930
If you don't want to then you don't have to. You don't need to force it.

660
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,940
- What?<br>- Being a Goblin's bride.

661
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:06,390
What is your motive? The more I hear about it, I keep noticing you wanting me to hate it.

662
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,850
Why are you saying those now? Ah! You don't want me being the Goblin's bride?

663
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,930
Or you have another woman?

664
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:16,090
"Even if I have another woman, I don't like you, so don't do it."

665
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:19,960
Seeing the sword, taking the sword out. That's the order, right?

666
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,730
I will prove being the bride by pulling that sword out.

667
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,230
Let's see if you become pretty.

668
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,790
Hey! Talk while you're there.

669
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:31,090
Then make me gold bars with your magic club.

670
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:33,160
Why should I?

671
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,580
Hey! I don't have a club!

672
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,800
You don't have one? How could a goblin not have a magic club?

673
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,680
Wow! The water became a sword!

674
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,780
Wow! So cool!

675
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,090
The sword has been misrepresented as a club.

676
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:06,960
I see. So that's why they say love quarrels are like cutting water with a sword.

677
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,510
It's not.

678
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:15,500
Right. During a honeymoon, it should be a water fight.

679
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,090
Stand right there.

680
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,610
Hey!

681
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:34,550
Good for you, winning against a high schooler. You use your powers to win over a high schooler?

682
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,430
Can't I use it them?

683
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,720
Do I not have abilities?

684
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,980
You can do all sorts of things.

685
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,680
Don't I have any special powers other than being able to see ghosts? After all, I'm the Goblin's bride.

686
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,820
Do you wish you had one?

687
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,010
I want gold to come out this much.

688
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,310
- Can you do it?<br>- No.

689
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:08,420
Stay here and wait.

690
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,560
- Why?<br>- I have something to do.

691
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,810
I don't know when I will be back. You can wait, right?

692
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:17,990
Ah! And also, since you said you're always near books.

693
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,510
Have it near you.

694
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:25,570
I will be sad if you leave me behind.

695
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:26,880
Just so you know.

696
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,710
I won't leave you behind.

697
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:31,330
Why? Because I'm the Goblin's wife?

698
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:45,760
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

699
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,680
Please deliver it to him.

700
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,930
Mister!

701
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,690
<i>Mass is not proportional to volume.</i>

702
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,800

703
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,050
<i>A girl who moves like a flower petal</i>

704
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,800
<i>is pulling me toward her with more force than Earth's mass.</i>

705
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:49,860
<i>Just then, like Newton's apple,</i>

706
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,630
<i>I rolled toward her without stopping until I fell on her...</i>

707
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,560
<i>with a loud thud.</i>

708
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:07,040
<i>With a thump.</i>

709
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,990
The red carpet is awesome! You were the one who did it, right?

710
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,760
It's so fascinating!

711
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,870
Mister...

712
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,990
<i>My heart keeps bouncing between the sky and the ground.</i>

713
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,780
Mister, are you mad?

714
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,110
<i>It was first love.</i>

722

723
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,990

728
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,310
