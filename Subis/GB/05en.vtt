I'm sorry for startling you. I want to ask you for a favor.

38
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,780
I'm really sorry for asking this, but can you fill up the refrigerator that's in the room where I used to live?

39
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,280
The refrigerator?

40
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,500
It hasn't been too long since I passed away. Mom was busy with the funeral and hasn't been to my place yet.

41

00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,720
I should at least know the name of the Goblin who's going to be my husband.

174
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,490
Us... I guess there's no "us" yet.

175
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,820
I think it started before you were born.

176
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,610
Us.

177
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,980
Sometimes Yoo Jeong Shin; other times, Yoo Jae Shin.

178
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,970
Currently I'm Yoo Shin Jae.

179
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,760
My real name is... Kim Shin.

180
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,700
We can go...

181
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,760
It's green light.

182
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,820
Today... is the day we put out the trash.

183
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,540
You are refreshing every time I see you.

184
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,380
Give it to me. I will do that from now on.

185
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,020
What's with her? Why is she trying to impress me all of a sudden?

186
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,810
She will be living with us starting today.

187
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,260
<i>For your sake, the choice that I have to make...</i>

188
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,640
<i>it's to end my life.</i>

189
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,190
I'm rooting for the path that's ahead of you and the things you will do. Let's go inside.

190
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,700
Yes. Please take care of me.

191
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,550
So, the thing that I will be doing in the future... there must be a lot of housework.

192
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,500
It must be 4 digits, right?

193
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,430
Probably have to press the star (*) at the end...

194
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,990
You don't know the passcode? Both of you?

195
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,340
We've never keyed in the code before going in.

196
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:52,430
It reminds me of that moment... Right before you go in the haunted house at an amusement park.

197
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:57,490
You feel scared and nervous, and you don't know what's inside.

198
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,870
And you wonder if you'll be able to come out safely once you go in.

199
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,800
Come in.

200
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,010
You... Why here... ? Why is she... When and how is she here?

201
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,310
She's going to be living with us starting today.

202
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,910
Please take care of me.

203
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,990
Tell her the passcode.

204
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,720
1004 (Angel). But why is she living here?<br>(T/N: "cheon sa" - 1004 and angel are homonyms in the Korean language.)

205
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,260
Why? What about me? About me?

206
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,150
You drink that in one go. Sober up.

207
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,400
We should get a cozy chair right about there.

208
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,970
Is this a photo studio? It would be better to have pastel colored wallpapers that soothe your emotions.

209
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,540
Is this a kindergarten?

210
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,560
We'll put a 19th-century romanticism art. And a fireplace here would be good.

211
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,510
Is this a hotel? Over there, we should have a Scandinavian style wallpaper.

212
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,090
- Is this a model house? She's my guest!<br>- It's my house!

213
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,330
It's my room.

214
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,220
I'm okay with everything.

215
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,880
We'll put up some 19th-century romantic art style wallpaper on this side.

216
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,300
And we'll put a pastel-toned fireplace over here. To be fair.

217
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,470
Then for now, should I sleep on the living room sofa today?

218
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,500
If you are uncomfortable having me in the living room, the flower garden is okay, too.

219
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,230
I'm not in the position to discriminate where to sleep.

220
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,190
- So, if you are going to bring someone in, you should get a bed fi--<br>- Sleep in my room tonight.

221
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,560
With you?

222
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,050
No!

223
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,340
Then what about you?

224
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,720
- What does this mean?<br>- I shall sleep on the bed,

225
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,840
so don't worry about me and sleep comfortably on the sofa.

226
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,000
Look at how strangely this Goblin talks. Never. It's my bed. You'll make it unlucky.

227
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,180
I know. I told you not to concern yourself.

228
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,430
- Go and sleep in the sofa in the living room.<br>- I can't sleep on the sofa.

229
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,790
- She'll probably be going in and out.<br>- Then go sleep in a hotel!

230
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,540
I can't sleep at a hotel. She's in that room alone.

231
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,930
Where are you going?

232
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,990
The miscellaneously omitted... I'll make her sleep in the flower garden.

233
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,060
- Were you always this inconsiderate?<br>- Yeah.

234
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,830
- Then I will sleep on the sofa.<br>- Don't talk to me.

235
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,870
Please help her a lot when she's around.

236
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,010
Aigoo. It's so comfortable.

237
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,100
Do I have to sit like this?

238
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,730
My book.

239
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,420
I told him to look at it. Did I tell him he could have it?

240
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,550
<i>[The stars might take your grief away]</i>

241
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:22,960
He didn't throw it away.

242
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,790
He's preciously cherishing it.

243
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,750
What book is this?

244
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,920
I don't know Chinese characters.

245
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,540
<i>Even in a foreign land, the war does not stop.</i>

246
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,370
<i>With swords and arrows, snatching the land and the grains. </i>

247
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,600
<i>Taking lives.</i>

248
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,910
<i>The god of the foreign land and the god of Goryeo are all the same. </i>

249
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,930
<i>The child who left Goryeo with me...</i>

250
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:13,790
<i>I buried him and his grandchild's grandchild.</i>

251
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,300
<i>I, in a chair in a corner of a room,</i>

252
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,800
<i>I spent days and weeks.</i>

253
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,880
<i>My will is not words that are left in the face of death.</i>

254
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,470
<i>Dear God, </i>

255
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:36,960
<i>my last testament is to ask you for death. </i>

256
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,900
<i>Though I have at times regarded this life as a reward, in the end my life was a punishment. </i>

257
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,190
<i>Anyone's death...</i>

258
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,280
<i>I couldn't forget one.</i>

259
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,000
<i>So I...</i>

260
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,840
<i>am to end this life.</i>

261
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,210
<i>However, God is not listening as always.</i>

262
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,350
Have you seen God?

263
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,740
Perhaps, are you looking at him now?

264
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,850
I told you not to talk to me. How could someone like me see God?

265
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,300
I have seen him before.

266
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,650
- What does he look like?<br> - Just...

267
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,630
It was a butterfly.

268
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:45,670
It's always like that. It makes you not able to touch a passing butterfly recklessly.

269
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,550
If he had at least shown me his face,

270
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,740
then I could resent him objectively.

271
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,400
I know.

272
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,310
If God really does only give you how much you can handle,

273
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,800
I wonder if he didn't overestimate me.

274
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,170
Are you having a hard time?

275
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,880
Don't worry. I won't cry in your arms.

276
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,630
God whom humans see that often...

277
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,830
how could we not see him even once?

278
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,930
Right, this is the Goblin's house.

279
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,850
I wonder what they do for breakfast.

280
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,790
I wonder if there's any groceries.

281
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,060
They have everything that's needed,

282
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,860
but it feels lonely somehow...

283
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,340
How beautiful.

284
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,060
I wondered how it would be since it's a men's household.

285
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,920
It's been such a long time since I've had a meal prepared by someone.

286
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,260
I didn't say I was going to give you any.

287
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,820
Thank you for the meal.

288
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,270
I will earn my own allowance. And starting tomorrow, I will take care of my own meals.

289
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,050
- I will also do the laundry myself. <br> - That's how we usually do it.

290
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,920
A wealthy household like this usually has helpers that do--

291
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,740
What's this? Did you practice without me knowing?

292
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,580
You seem to be in top form.

293
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,890
Since you two are like this, I see why you can't get any helpers.

294
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,300
So I wrote down a few things in a similar context.

295
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,900
I wish you would abide by them.

296
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,580
My appeals. First, I hope it doesn't rain often.

297
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,360
Since the citizens would be uncomfortable, so as long as I am living here, I wish you would be happy.

298
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,750
2. If you have any complaints, please say them. Saying that you'll take me

299
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:54,580
or you would make things that could make you take me, I hope there would be none of those.

300
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,790
3. If you have something urgent, please call first. Don't just suddenly appear in front of me.

301
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:03,290
Ji Eun Tak. 010-1234-1234. And you can't do so during class hours.

302
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:07,840
Not during work and I turn it off in the library. That's all.

303
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,400
I will be going to school.

304
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,440
Could she be telling us to call her?

305
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,070
Is she looking down on us because we don't have cellphones?

306
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,950
Really?

307
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:42,510
I want this one in chic black. I like it. You have this bluish-blue. You like it?

308
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,750
This punk is over-excited since it's his first time seeing something like this. Explain it.

309
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,770
Now, now. Take your time memorizing your numbers. This is called a smart phone...

310
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,410
I'm okay, so just explain it to him who's never seen this before.

311
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:01,830
What he said is right. You only need to explain to me.

312
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,430
Uncle, do you know how to use it? This thing is very smart--

313
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,590
Do you think I didn't use it because I don't know how?

314
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,750
- It's because I don't have any need--<br>- When I watch dramas,

315
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,420
they look at each other's faces when they call.

316
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,750
If you were that desperate, you should have bought this 300 years ago!

317
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,030
These uncles, seriously. I will teach you that later.

318
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,540
Now, first. Let's go to the Play store.

319
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,030
- Now?<br>- What?

320
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,810
W-Why are you getting up?

321
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,090
- You said let's go to the Play store. <br> - Oh.

322
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,590
Is it far?

323
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,150
What are you doing? Go get dressed.

324
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,760
You said you wanted to call while seeing each other's faces.

325
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,540
I know. I can't see your face, though.

326
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,390
Are you holding it against your ear? Move it away.

327
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,050
Move what away?

328
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,050
Your arm! Hold it at arm's length!

329
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,900
Like this.

330
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,650
Arm?

331
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,230
Okay.

332
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,030
Like this?

333
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,080
Like this?

334
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,180
I can't see.

335
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,400
What should we do about you?

336
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,200
<i>[Kim Shin]</i>

337
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,080
When they say military officer... A general?

338
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,790
Oh, public service. A stable job.

339
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:58,270
But why aren't there any articles? Were there not many accomplishments?

340
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,310
What is this? I don't know this number.

341
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,430
Hello?

342
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,140

00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,200
proud on its strong materials with a light and slim body.

346
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,270
What did you memorize it?

347
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:30,350
What do you need? There are a lot of toothbrushes and towels at home.

348
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:34,240
Ahjussi, you don't know what this it, right? Actually, this is you.

349
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,190
The cheeks are pink, so why is it me?

350
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,360
Not that. He's actually a goblin, but since people are scared of him

351
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,090
he's wearing his favorite buckwheat hoodie and pretending he's not a goblin.

352
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,460
Isn't he so cute? You understand what I mean, right?

353
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,100
Ahjussi, this is something that people use to study at night.

354
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,580
Ahjussi, this!

355
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,360
Do you have anything else that you need?

356
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,500
This is a lot. When I think about having to carry all these when I move out, it's nothing but luggage.

357
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,650
- What do you mean?<br>- You never know with a relationship between a man and a woman. I could leave.

358
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,220
Not that? I'm asking what you mean by carrying them all when you leave.

359
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,320
Who said I'm going to let you have them when you leave?

363

364

371
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,440

372

I'm not who I used to be. I have a family now.

It's not Ji Eun Tak.

424
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,260
Not your name. A man's name that women like.

425
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,190
What?

426
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:21,660
I don't have a name.

427
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,630
So I want a suggestion. What name would be like that?

428
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:29,690
You don't have a name? Mr. Goblin had one.

429

00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,310
Kim Shin. Isn't it pretty?

431
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,110
Jerk.

432
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,690
Well, do you have a name you thought of?

433
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:46,650
Hyeok, Joon...

434
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,640
Min?

435
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,640
If it's a name that women like, there are three that best represents it.

436
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:05,420
Hyun Bin, Won Bin, Kim Woo Bin.

437
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,230
Bin...

438
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:19,060
It's not possible that he's really using Hyun Bin, Won Bin or Kim Woo Bin, right?

439
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,230
But your name is Yoo Deok Hwa, isn't it?

440
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:29,430
There's a backstory to that which I've been deeply upset over. Why did Uncle have to be so into Yoo Deok Hwa (Andy Lau) in '92?

441
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,690
That's why I haven't even watched the Moogando (Internal Affairs) yet. I'm boycotting.

442
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:36,460
Even if I become the head of Cheon Woo Group, I'll probably still come up behind that guy in search rankings who was born in '61.

443
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,820
But then again, I would lose even to you.

444
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,890
What does that mean?

445
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,530
It means that a really important thing lies in your hands.

446
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,550
- Something important? Like what? <br>- My card!

447
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,760

00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,420

That's why I'm saying this, but could there be something that Grandpa told you to give me?

462
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,950
There is.

463
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:52,340
Ji Eun Tak's college entrance exams aren't too far away, so he said she should take good care of her health.

464
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,550
W-What you have to give me is not a card?

465

First, don't talk to Ji Eun Tak. Second, remember that silence is golden. Third, be silent. Fourth, keep the mouth shut.

466
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,890
He asked me to relay this message with the hopes that you could handle these difficult tasks very well.

What is your dream? What do you want to be?

481
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,130
While eating this much and not taking out the sword and just studying, what is your dream?

482
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:36,600
A radio PD (program director). For the rolling admission, I studied that department as well.

483
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,690
That's not what I'm saying. How will you get accepted to college when lacking such comprehension?

484
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,490
Why would you wish me bad?

485
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:49,970
Actually I thought about it carefully,

486
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:54,430
and about you getting pretty, I put it on hold for now.

487
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,400
On hold? Are you sure you thought about it carefully?

488
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,700
What if you kick me out after I lose my effective value? The thought of that is so stressful that I can't study.

489
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,400
If you can't even study, then why are you finishing up the snacks every time?

490
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,110
See! Your true colors are showing. You begrudge it?

491
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:13,310
That's why, how nice would it have been if you gave me the $5000 when I asked?

492
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:20,700
Hey, still, I am water and fire and someone who's here but not, so how can I be so crass as to bounce it off with cash?

493
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,710
I'd accept it with refinement, of course.

494
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,960
But... why does it have to be $5000?

495
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,340
The amount is too ambiguous. It'll be hard to even rent a place with that in Seoul.

496
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:39,950
I don't even dare to dream about renting a place. Until I grow up, it's money to stay at a sauna,

497
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:44,900
and if ever I do get accepted into college then I would need tuition.

498
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:52,170
I came up with that exact amount after careful calculation of student loans and various living costs.

499
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:59,430
That ambiguous $5000 is like $5,000,000 to someone like me who has nothing. Happy?

500
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,570
Give her $5000. How could you do that? So coldhearted.

501
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:09,670
<i>I have something I am curious about.</i>

502
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:10,830
<i>I won't give you $5000 (ohbaek).</i>

503
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:13,940
<i>That startled me. I heard it as confess (gobaek).</i>

504
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,650
Give her $5000.

505
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,640
Make your pronunciation clear. I got startled!

506
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,810
He said to give me $5000.

507
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,630
Go and study.

508
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,350
But, then, is your name Kim Shin?

509
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:38,890
Yeah. Why?

510
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:44,550
Your name... is really cool.

511
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:01,770
Seriously, he's not calling. Call.

512
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,170
Boss, are you busy?

513
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,900
I don't even remember when I was last busy.

514
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:17,560
Then... can I call you Unni for a while? I have no unni that I can confide in.

515
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:22,190
Wanting to call me unni... then there's only one genre.

516
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,270
Are you pregnant?

517
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,930
No!

518
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,950
- Then? <br> - Just...

519
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:30,970
What do you think about marrying early?

520
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,240
How old is the guy? 19? 20?

521
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,370
A bit more.

522
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:39,940
It's not much even if you say so. What kind of kid is he?

523
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:48,910
He's always near books, he has deep taste in music and art, and he also used to work for the country back then...

524
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:53,130
Not that, what does he do to you? Does he treat you well?

525
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,500
Ahhh...

526
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,860
For now. Since he needs me.

527
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,590
Then what about you? Do you like that punk?

528
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:03,500
No.

529
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,410
Then what about that punk, does he like you?

530
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,880
No.

531
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:16,600
What's that then? Both of you don't like each other. Why do this marriage?

532
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,760
I know, right.

533
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,630
What's with this marriage?

534
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,230
Continue with your work.

535
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,770
<i>Mister, do you love me?</i>

536
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,410
<i>If that is needed, I will do that, too.</i>

537
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,730
<i>I love you.</i>

538
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,230
I don't need that love.

539
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:57,360
Make sure you're not the one who needs it.

540
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,930
Just wait and see if I let him become pretty...

541
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,690
I'm back.

542
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,160
Are you folding laundry? I will do it, too.

543
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,720
You were always doing this by yourself before, right? I can tell.

544
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,160
Thank you for recognizing it.

545
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:39,240
So all the bathroom towels are washed by Mr. Grim Reaper. No wonder it felt killer.

546
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:43,960
Can you please refrain from the expression "killer".

547
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,560
I'm sorry.

548
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:52,760
I really like the towels in this house. They are soft and fluffy.

549
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,980
Thank you.

550
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:00,580
Netherland's representative painter of the 17th century royal family.

551
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:06,070
Rembrand van Rijn's painting best known as "The Night Watch" unveiling the spectrum of light and darkness.

552
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:12,290
But actually the true name of the paiting is "The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq." Where should I hang it?

553
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,990
That scarf, I think I saw that when you were 9. It's the same one, right?

554
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,730
You're right.

555
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,540
It's a keepsake from my mom.

556
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:35,330
My mom thought that I could see ghosts because of the mark on my neck.

557
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:41,280
So she always placed this around my neck since I was a child in hopes that I wouldn't see ghosts when it's covered.

558
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:48,660
But it was no use. But it became a habit. Now this is like my mom.

559
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:54,910
- Give her $5000 (ohbaek).<br>- Why do keep on telling me to confess (gobaek)?

560
00:54:54,910 --> 00:55:00,020
And also you! You've got a story to every question. I'm too scared to even ask you a question now.

561
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,470
- What's with him?<br>- I didn't reply to you though.

562
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,720
He has a really bad personality.

563
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,670
You must have had a hard time.

564
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,790
But, have you decided on a name?

565
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:11,970
Hey, Senior. Aren't you going to study? You might not get into college if you do well (keep it up).

566
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:14,730
Why would I not get in if I do well? If I do well then I would go in.

567
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,860
Nevermind. Go in and study. Would you be a radio PD if you do that?

568
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,200
Oh, you want to be a radio PD? So cool.

569
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,420
Yes, I liked radios since I was a child.

570
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,430
I was the one who mentioned about radio but why are you talking to him?

571
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:29,930
Talking with people that I live with--

572
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:35,330
People? See if there are any people that you live with. Look at the sword here!

573
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:41,540
Mister, perhaps if you haven't decided on a name, how about Park Bo Gum? Park Bo Gum (gum=sword)?

574
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,790
What "gum?" Just because I have been lenient because you see the sword!

575
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,460
Seriously.

576
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:54,720
Whose fault is it that I have this mark and that I can see ghosts?

577
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,060
Have what? It's pretty.

578
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,410
Mister, did you just lift my hair?

579
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:06,740
Ahh! That's why you got stabbed with a sword. People get stabbed for a reason.

580
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,510
How could you poke a person where it hurts? <br>Are you a psychopath?

581
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:15,850
Mister, do you think you weren't like that at first? You said I wasn't the goblin's bride, don't live in rumors but in reality.

582
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,740
You must think you've never poked where it hurts and you're all soft and fluffy!

583
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,430
I said that for your sake! For you.

584
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:27,610
If it's for me, give me a boyfriend! Part-time work, my aunt's family, and boyfriend!<br> My wish for a boyfriend has not come true yet!

585
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,800
- It's here! Your boyfriend!<br>- Where? Where here?

586
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,740
Here! Right in front of you! Me!

587
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:18,350
He must be crazy. What boyfriend?

588
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:21,890
With whose permission? Does he like me?

589
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,700
So outrageous.

590
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,350
That was a slip of the tongue for the first time in 900 years.

591
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:36,080
Technically, it would be husband not boyfriend.

592
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,340
Should I go and make the correction minutely?

593
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,930
This is troublesome.

594
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,590
Someone can't even make a phone call because he has no name.

595
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,900
They are just...

596
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:11,250
Someone can't even make a phone call because he has no name.

597
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:13,520
They are just...

598
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:18,510
- It's so dark in here.<br>- What are you doing?<br>- You're still at that?

599
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:20,010
Leave. Both of you.

600
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,420
What's wrong with Uncle down the hall?

601
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:25,470
It a face that's thinking of a woman.

602
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:27,690
What did I do? Where?

603
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:31,060
This must be that woman's number.

604
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:32,870
Put that down while I'm talking.

605
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:36,450
Uncle, this kiss mark, did you try kissing it or not? Honestly?

606
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:40,100
You need to follow me. That place won't be a good one.

607
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,010
- Uncle.<br> - It's going.

608
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:43,850
Hey! Don't!

609
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,240
If you won't call then why get her number?

610
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,250
To appear human. You never know when I would call.

611
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,430
Now is that time.

612
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:50,590
<i>Hello?</i>

613
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,070
Like a human. Hurry.

614
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:08,460
<i>Not Seon Hee, but Sunny</i>

615
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,090
Hello, I am...

616
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:18,790
No. Should I go roughly?

617
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,900
What are you doing? Don't you recognize my voice?

618
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,440
Not this, either.

619
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,780
Hello. Oh my! Hello.

620
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:32,470
- I go for the third.<br>- You were listening?

621
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:33,400
Why aren't you getting caught?

622
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:39,030
Isn't it cool? Fascinating, right? I could do this, too.

623
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,950
Ding.

624
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,800
- What's this?<br>- Eat, eat.

625
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,980
Freeze.

626
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,340
<i>Hello.</i>

627
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:05,420
Hello.

628
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:09,090
You know how to call.

629
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:12,070
I thought you didn't or maybe you broke a finger.

630
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:17,090
Ah, yes. I learned. My finger is not broken. Thank you for the concern.

631
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,070
So my number was there.

632
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:22,400
Yes. Your number is here.

633
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,250
I waited for your call.

634
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,110
Ahh... yes.

635
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:35,950
"Ahh... yes." Is there nothing after?

636
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:39,030
<i>Don't you have anything more you want to say?</i>

637
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:43,120
- For example?<br>- Morning, lunch or night? When is the most comfortable time to meet or something like that.

638
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,990
Morning, lunch or night? When is the most comfortable time to meet?

639
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:49,150
I find it comfortable to meet in the morning and separately at night.

640
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,540
I must seem human, so I'll walk.

641
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,660
Get in.

642
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:59,090
A human won't be able to walk all the way to Incheon.

643
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,790
Ah!

644
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:14,400
<i>- It's here. Your boyfriend!<br>- Where? Where here?<br>- Right here! In front of you! Me!</i>

645
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:22,700
I was startled because you were in front of me.

646
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,580
I was thirsty... that... I have to go to work.

647
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,630
Ji Eun Tak...

648
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:37,570
Yes?

649
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,110
You called me just now.

650
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:43,210
- I did?<br>- Yes.<br>- Why? <br>- I know. Why?

651
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:47,820
Because it's awkward.

652
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,180
Me, too.

653
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:05,870
Then... should I say I'm hungry, naturally?

654
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:12,310
Will you? Then I will naturally say, "Do you want to eat beef?"

655
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:18,400
I will go and get my coat then come out. Go and wear your coat.

656
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:27,230
I'm done wearing. Let's go.

657
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:31,640
Wow! This is my second time here. I might be a regular at this rate.

658
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:35,310
We sat there back then.

659
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,400
<i>Welcome to Quebec. Please have a seat.</i>

660
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:15,080
<i>I know, right? I've never been abroad before so I didn't know.</i>

661
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:21,510
<i>So why travel abroad at 29? When I was 29, I didn't even go to the supermarket in front of my house. </i>

662
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:24,040
<i>- Really?<br><i>- Yeah, becauseI didn't have any appointment.</i></i>

663
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,950
<i>I've been traveling around just fine, for someone who's never been abroad before.</i>

664
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:33,500
<i>I'll only get lost a little, I won't skip meals and I will eat a big chunk of cow.</i>

665
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:37,510
<i>I'm at a nice restaurant with some man.</i>

666
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:41,170
<i>It's the man that has to be nice, not the restaurant. I have to go. I'm sleepy.</i>

667
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:44,070
<i>Okay. Have a good night.</i>

668
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:52,540
<i>CEO, over here.</i>

669
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:23,440
<i>At the age of 29, you're still shining.</i>

670
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:33,150
<i>But I'm not... by your side.</i>

671
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:43,100
<i>My life of eternity has finally come to an end.</i>

672
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:49,060
<i>In the time after my death, you are still here.</i>

673
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:59,080
<i>You've forgotten me and your life is perfectly complete with me gone. </i>

674
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:04,270
<i>I have to disappear</i>

675
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:08,280
<i>to make you smile.</i>

676
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,740
<i>This is the decision I have to make.</i>

677
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,610
<i>I have to end my life.</i>

678
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:40,250
♬ <i> Where I am, who I am </i> ♬

679
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:43,190
♬ <i> This loneliness like a prison <i> ♬</i></i>

680
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,170
In the end,

681
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:50,030
that's the decision I made.

682
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:56,640
♬ <i>This place that everyone just passes by me </i> ♬

683
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,180
♬ <i> Oh, where I am </i> ♬

684
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:08,500
♬ <i> Who are you? Who are you ? </i> ♬

685
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:15,350
♬ <i> This happiness I cannot hide </i> ♬

686
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:25,850
♬ <i> Even if I dig around the world like I am crazy </i> ♬

687
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:29,740
♬ <i> Dearest, where are you </i> ♬

688
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:33,480
♬ <i> I will find you </i> ♬

689
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,220
♬ <i> I will recognize you </i> ♬

690
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:44,540
♬ <i> No matter what you look like I will recognize you </i> ♬

691
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:52,060
♬ <i> I will remember it. I will recognize you. </i> ♬

692
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:56,680
♬ <i> Even if you are somewhere I am not </i> ♬

693
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:06,800
♬ <i> I will not forget. Your speech, expression, everything </i> ♬

694
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,560
<i>- Preview -</i>

695
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,980
<i>He's still handsome and still strange.</i>

696
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:24,980
<i>I know he's strange but when I see his face, I forget all that.</i>

697
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:29,580
<i>You don't press down the head like that. </i>

698
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:36,560
<i>You're supposed to brush it gently.</i>

699
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:43,220
<i>Can you make me prettier now?</i>

700
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:48,470
<i>- Yes.<br>- You shouldn't get hurt anymore.</i>

701
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:52,040
<i>You've been hurt many times.</i>

702
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,190
<i>I left the deed of the property in the room.</i>

703
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,010
<i>This is really your house now.</i>

704
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:06,150
<i>Have a long and happy life.</i>

705
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:08,920
<i>And I have a favor to ask.</i>

706
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:15,360
<i>When I disappear, her mark will disappear, too.</i>

707
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:23,470
<i>When that happens, erase her memories. Don't let her blame herself.</i>
