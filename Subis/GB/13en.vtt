00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,710
<i>- Episode 13 -</i>

3
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,510
<i>As expected... I seem to be the worst memory.</i>

4
00:01:51,510 --> 00:02:00,860
<i>- To you... and to Kim Shin, too. <br>- You hear my voice, right?</i>

5
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:10,360
I can hear your voice. Very clearly.

6
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,370
General Kim Shin...

7
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,050
is here to see Your Majesty.

8
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,140
After 900 years

9
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,210
I am seeing you, Your Majesty.

10
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,300
Whether my eyes were covered by the 900 years of time

11
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,960
or by God's dislike for me, I could not recognize you even though you were next to me.

12
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,910
You...

13
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,720
are Wang Yeo.

14
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,400
In the end...

15
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,610
am I him?

16
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,750
Am I...

17
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,570
Wang Yeo?

18
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,530
The young and foolish face...

19
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,640
in the end...

20
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,350
is it me?

21
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:18,640
The battlefield was always hell, and we came back from that place.

22
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,610
Even the enemies were not able to kill us.

23
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,570
But those men... my young sister...

24
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,530
and my relatives who had no sins...

25
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,750
they were stabbed with swords and shot with arrows in front of my own eyes.

26
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,370
By an order,

27
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,900
with one word from the young and foolish king.

28
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,600
Am I...

29
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,690
him?

30
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,670
So I really am... Wang Yeo?

31
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,160
I still remember every single moment of that hell every day.

32
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,270
But since you have no memory,

33
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,840
it must be comfortable for you.

34
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,580
Even after 900 years has passed...

35
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,110
<i>When did the heavens side with you?</i>

36
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,220
The heavens, as always, are on your side.

37
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,530
What on earth... did I do?

38
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,610
What memory did I erase?

39
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,750
What choice did I make?

40
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,460
Exactly...

41
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,150
how much of a coward was I?

42
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,260
How did it go? Did you meet Park Joong Hun?

43
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,530
I met him. Park Joong Hun and Wang Yeo, too.

44
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,500
Pack your things lightly and come down. Let's go.

45
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,570
- Where to?<br>- We are going to Chairman Yoo's main house.

46
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,170
Yes. Just give me 10 minutes.

47
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,620
Ji Eun Tak,

48
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,240
why aren't you asking anything? Did you know...

49
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,420
that he was Wang Yeo?

50
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,050
It was something that the deceased told me. I wasn't sure about his intentions,

51
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,350
so I thought it shouldn't be relayed to you carelessly. However,

52
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,130
whether I told you or not, I thought that a fate that's meant to be avoided will be avoided

53
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,690
and if it's a destined meeting, then you would meet it.

54
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,900
I'm sorry.

55
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,220
Pack your things and come out.

56
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,200
We're going to stay here for now. Let the helpers have a break for the time being.

57
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,350
Okay. But, Uncle, why are you staying here?

58
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,700
We will use a guest room each on the second floor. You don't have to worry.

59
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,230
Okay. But, Uncle, why are you staying here?

60
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,560
I... will go to Boss' place.

61
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,200
I'm worried. I'm sure she must be full of questions.

62
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,500
Okay, then I'll ask that of you.

63
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,420
- If something happens...<br>- I know.

64
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,760
Rest a bit. Deok Hwa Oppa will take me there.

65
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,480
I will?

66
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,360
What is it? Why did you pack your things and leave? Did he fight with Uncle down the hall?

67
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,350
I mean, even if they fought... he should chase out Uncle down the hall. Why leave?

68
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,760
Won't it be consideration? Since Mr. Reaper has no place to go.

69
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,020
Ah... If you put it like that, it's sad.

70
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,790
<i>The phone is turned off. You will be connected to voicemail.</i>

71
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,930
<i>Charges will be made after the beep.</i>

72
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:27,330
<i>You... in this lifetime, too, you are protecting that dummy.</i>

73
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,430
What about Orabeoni? Where is he?

74
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,950
He came out of the house with me.

75
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,140
Then what about that person?

76
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,770
I think... he's at the house.

77
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,800
That means he's at least alive.

78
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,350
I don't think he's someone who was alive to begin with...

79
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,330
Right.

80
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,750
But then, about you getting the memories from your past life...

81
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,350
how did you remember them?

82
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,830
In an erotic way.

83
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,330
What?

84
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,660
It means, let's drink. Soju or beer?

85
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,330
Part-timer, if a person really has four lives...

86
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,120
I have thought about it, and I think I am living the fourth one.

87
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,660
- Why?<br>- I know at least two lifetimes.

88
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,130
And since I met my Orabeoni

89
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,630
and my lover in this lifetime...

90
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,780
What about you?

91
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,720
Me... I wish this would be my first life.

92
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,000
Why? In the second life, third life,

93
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,660
and fourth life, you want to meet my Orabeoni, too?

94
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,820
You should have seen his horrible stubbornness during the Goryeo Dynasty.

95
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,660
He knew he would die, so why did he have to return?

96
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,610
He should have just lived by himself.

97
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,910
I mean, it's unfair for us to have to split the utility bill according to the number of people in the household.

98
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,980
Ever since that woman downstairs came, it went up 4000 won more.

99
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,530
She said she got her apartment's deposit and moved here. She's pitiful.

100
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,840
Then what about me?

101
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,720
I just barely got the deposit together to live on my own for the first time in my life.

102
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:47,100
Well... be it the first or fourth, it's still important.

103
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,770
Isn't that so?

104
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,020
What are you talking about?

105
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,450
And also, the pipes are frozen so water does not come out.

106
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,910
So why do I have to pay equally per person?

107
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,370
Exactly...

108
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,090
It's sad... fate is.

109
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:08,490
In the end, will they end up paying so dearly?

110
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,660
I really should not be like this...

111
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,240
What is your name?

112
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,940
Give me cash, the card is not accepted.

113
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,330
<i>Send me the word that you died a heroic death. I will send word that I am in deep mourning.</i>

114
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,100
<i>I don't want you to die.</i>

115
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,330
<i>Those two are not here for the graduation but to see someone who's here to see the graduation.</i>

116
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,750
About Reaper Kim from Jangamdong,

117
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,520
it is just a rumor

118
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,730
but because of some soul's whispers

119
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,610
he held a dying person's...

120
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,480
hand.

121
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,360
Could that spirit be the one that you lost?

122
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,680
That Miscellaneous Omitted Person?

123
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,940
Are you listening?

124
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,640
Senior!

125
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,410
Huh? What did you say?

126
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,850
What's wrong with you these days?

127
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,630
With a Miscellaneous Omitted Person...

128
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,710
what happened?

129
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,850
<i>Here you are.</i>

130
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,470
Seeing your face,

131
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,520
in the end, you held

132
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,850
that hand.

133
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,140
So what did you see?

134
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,240
What sins were in there?

135
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,280
I wasn't in there.

136
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,390
It was only that woman.

137
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,150
That woman, in the past, in some era

138
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,330
was a queen.

139
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,410
In there, was I there?

140
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,340
Perhaps...

141
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,360
is there a hand that brought tonics beside me?

142
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,520
Just like yours, slender and white.

143
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,990
<i>Do you know what was in that tonic?</i>

144
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,790
My sin is your sin.

145
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,430
No. No, there's no way.

146
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,650
The owner of the hands that brought that tonic was you.

147
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,960
How pitiful is this?

148
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,830
Since you have no memories

149
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,160
you don't even recognize yourself.

150
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,870
No...

151
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,670
There's no way.

152
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,000
Don't worry.

153
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,780
I will keep your secret.

154
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,770
More than that, if it gets known that you used your abilities as a reaper

155
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,210
then you will be in trouble.

156
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,630
So your sins, too,

157
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,830
and my sins...

158
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,750
let's keep them a secret.

159
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,390
As expected, you are Kim Seon.

160
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:45,280
Even in this life, you will have to die in my hands.

161
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,940
Miscellaneous Omitted Person,

162
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,800
we have met before.

163
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,760
I felt it 20 years ago, too.

164
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,710
You are an evil soul,

165
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,630
a human's dark heart.

166
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,630
You take their evil energy and live off it.

167
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,710
I just change their black greed

168
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,930
to action.

169
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,980
<i>If I covered their eyes...</i>

170
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,160
<i>Is that why you pushed me on that rooftop?</i>

171
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,600
<i>...or if they covered their eyes.</i>

172
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,710
Stop all that nonsense.

173
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,360
What is your name?

174
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,010
Don't waste your time.

175
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,370
Even if you know my name, you won't be able to do anything to me.

176
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,720
Wouldn't that be the reason I am still here after 900 years?

177
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,720
Stop that nonsense...

178
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,930
and say your name.

179
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Do you even know your name that you're asking for mine?

180
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,870
Should I tell you?

181
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,300
You still hold a lowly thing in your hands.

182
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,570
Seeing how you're holding onto her thinking she is precious,

183
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,890
even in this life, too,

184
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,370
she will die without fail.

185
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,340
Does he... know me?

186
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:31,530
<i>- I thought you'd laugh.<br>- I thought you'd laugh.</i>

187
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,730
<i>I shouldn't laugh.</i>

188
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,290
<i>Ah! I shouldn't laugh though.</i>

189
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,930
<i>Hello?</i>

190
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,770
<i>Deok Hwa, it's me.</i>

191
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,330
Hello?

192
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,810
It looks like this.

193
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,680
So the king... gave him this sword...

194
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,650
Seeing how you're not asking anything,

195
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,880
you must be on the Goblin's side.

196
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,280
I'm sorry, but just once...

197
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,160
couldn't you be on my side?

198
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,280
What is it?

199
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,020
This... can you please give it to Sunny?

200
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,870
I thought there shouldn't even be such an excuse...

201
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,830
for me...

202
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,910
I will.

203
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,570
She will... probably not remember me.

204
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,320
The ring... make up an excuse for me.

205
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,580
I'm going.

206
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,570
But... I think she remembers...

207
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,640
Are you still waiting... for the king?

208
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,580
I can't wait now.

209
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:37,050
Why? Because you remember your past life?

210
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,690
Because the woman who loved the king...

211
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,990
is a traitor's sister.

212
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,400
That's why she died in that person's hands.

213
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,690
I keep getting confused.

214
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,410
The pain that is felt in the chest from the arrow

215
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,700
if it is me...

216
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,680
or if it was me from the past life.

217
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,910
I wonder if he was sad, too.

218
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,450
I only saw him turning his back.

219
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,550
He told me to cherish only happy moments...

220
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,770
but I must have liked all of it.

221
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,480
Seeing how I remember everything.

222
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,860
What about that person?

223
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,400
Did you meet him?

224
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,260
It's all in the past. It's far away in the past since it's a lifetime ago.

225
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,550
For you, it's your past life,

226
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,050
but, for me, it's still my present life,

227
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,410
because I am living that life.

228
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,350
I have nowhere to retreat to,

229
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,070
so I can only go forward.

230
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,220
And he killed you.

231
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,820
He didn't kill me but he killed Kim Seon. Not me.

232
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,840
I am Sunny. My life...

233
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,230
is this lifetime.

234
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,040
But if you insist on going forward...

235
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,880
then as always, even crossing lifetimes,

236
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,100
my answer will be the same as then.

237
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,590
Go, Orabeoni.

238
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,190
This time, if I go forward,

239
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,080
what I intend to do to Yeo,

240
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,830
it will not be forgiveness.

241
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,200
Don't worry about me.

242
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,420
In this lifetime,

243
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:08,280
I will really be happy, Orabeoni.

244
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,800
With this sword in his chest...

245
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,330
he lived 900 years.

246
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,710
That person...

247
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,880
We're the Grim Reaper Auditors Team.

248
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Have a seat.

249
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,600
While you were on duty,

250
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,460
we have confirmed that you used your abilities for personal reasons.

251
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,990
Aside from erasing a human's memory,

252
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,900
revealing a name card,

253
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,330
not reporting that your identity was revealed,

254
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,470
giving the memories of a past life back to a human being,

255
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,270
et cetera...

256
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,380
<i>You guys fought. You did not see anything.</i>

257
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,790
<i>"I will be going first," say it.</i>

258
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,490
<i>I will be going first.</i>

259
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,730
<i>I will go first.</i>

260
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,850
<i>Can you please look at my eyes?</i>

261
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,870
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

262
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,490
<i>but can you please look to my eyes?</i>

263
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,200
<i>Miscellaneous Omitted Person's name card arrived.</i>

264
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,960
<i>A name card arrived.</i>

265
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,280
<i>Miscellaneous Omitted Person.</i>

266
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,700
<i>There's something I didn't tell you about. Something I saw in Sunny's past life.</i>

267
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,760
<i>- I thought it was a secret.<br>- It seems like she's the reincarnation of your sister.</i>

268
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,020
<i>I am a grim reaper.</i>

269
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,480
Do you acknowledge everything?

270
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,420
- I do.<br>- Now that you've acknowledged it,

271
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,110
we will impose a severe disciplinary action.

272
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,960
So face the severity of this matter.

273
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,650
I will accept the punishment.

274
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,920
It won't be so easy to accept.

275
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,670
<i>Grim reapers are those who have</i>

276
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,160
<i>committed great sins in their past lives,</i>

277
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,050
<i>and while living through 200 years of hell,</i>

278
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,310
<i>they are those who chose to erase their memories.</i>

279
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:34,140
Thus, you should face your sins again.

280
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:38,790
That is the punishment for all that you have violated.

281
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,270
<i>Since you destroyed the band of traitors and showed them how robust you are,</i>

282
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:12,220
<i>the people are finally able to sleep well through the night,</i>

283
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,070
<i>so their praise of you has spread throughout the nation.</i>

284
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:22,510
<i>In case your mouth feels prickly, I ordered wine for you before the meal.</i>

285
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:28,050
<i>The scent is beautiful and with sweet and bitter flavors<br> mixed together, it will give you an appetite.</i>

286
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,900
<i>People are worried that your mind and body are not well.</i>

287
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,150
<i>Starting tomorrow, decrease the King's food and present him with a tonic.</i>

288
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:15,230
<i>Please take it even if it's bitter and make your body and mind <br>more clear so you can show your robust...</i>

289
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,950
<i>Is this... robust enough?</i>

290
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,110
<i>If ever one day you would be looking for this...</i>

291
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,690
<i>These silk clothes</i>...

292
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,580
<i>who should I put them on?</i>

293
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:38,640
<i>This beautiful jade ring, whose hand do I put it on?</i>

294
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,790
<i>These silk clothes...</i>

295
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,230
<i>who should I put them on? This beautiful jade ring...</i>

296
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,590
<i>whose hand should I put it on?</i>

297
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,700
<i>That beautiful jade ring...</i>

298
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,460
<i>give it to me.</i>

299
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:18,390
<i>That beautiful jade ring, give it to me.</i>

300
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,410
<i>I have a use for it.</i>

301
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,570
<i>Do you want to have it?</i>

302
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,070
<i>Fine.</i>

303
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,750
<i>Then I should give it to you. Have it.</i>

304
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:08,170
<i>These silk clothes have no owner, it seems.</i>

305
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,180
<i>Perhaps...</i>

306
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,140
<i>are you looking for them?</i>

307
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,420
<i>Then...</i>

308
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,440
<i>take them.</i>

309
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,530
<i>Your Highness, your tonic.</i>

310
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,320
<i>My people, my subjects,</i>

311
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,210
<i>my woman, too...</i>

312
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:47,430
<i>and even I myself... no one...</i>

313
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:54,670
<i>loved me. Till the end, from anyone,</i>

314
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,750
<i>I was not able to receive love.</i>

315
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,370
<i>Get more tonic.</i>

316
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,010
<i>I know what is in there.</i>

317
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,330
<i>Pardon?</i>

318
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,860
<i>Let's end it all at once.</i>

319
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:24,780
<i>The tonic... Bring me more.</i>

320
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,430
<i>It's an order.</i>

321
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,790
Your sins from this world,

322
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:49,950
and within all your sins, the greatest sin, which is taking your own life,

323
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,700
and 600 years of hell,

324
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,020
you have received all of them back.

325
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,230
Thus, as your duties as a reaper are suspended,

326
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:05,110
be on standby until your next order is given.

327
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,620
I...

328
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,390
was Wang Yeo.

329
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,720
I...

330
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,330
killed them all.

331
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,820
I killed myself...

332
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,370
<i>Kim Seon. Wang Yeo.</i>

333
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,120
<i>What are all your thoughts?</i>

334
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,230
What should I do?

335
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,990
What should I do with him?

336
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,500
Don't touch this again. You have no right to look at this and cry.

337
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,690
I...

338
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:06,010
gave the sword... to you.

339
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,990
I killed...

340
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:18,290
I killed everyone. I remember now.

341
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,590
I...

342
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,310
I was Wang Yeo.

343
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:44,550
That's right. It was you. You did it. You killed everyone! <br>You killed and killed and then you...

344
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,720
even killed yourself.

345
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,830
You... Your woman, your loyal subjects, your Goryeo

346
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,500
and even yourself, you weren't able to protect any of them.

347
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:02,560
Seon... my young sister protected you with her life.

348
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,090
You should have lived! You should have remained alive to the end and died by my sword!

349
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,360
So that crime of treason that you put on me,

350
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,420
you should have given it proof with your death!

351
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,150
Yes.

352
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:19,200
My sister probably knew that when my name came out of Park Joong Hun's mouth,

353
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,950
the next would be her name. That it would make a myriad of excuses for you.

354
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,230
So that fool... rather than become your weakness,

355
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,590
on that spot, she died as the sister of a traitor,

356
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,200
to save you.

357
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,540
The ring...

358
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,130
That ring... I...

359
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,850
put it on her in such a cruel way.

360
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:58,310
In her hand... that ring...

361
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:05,470
came and went in this lifetime, too... I ask of you...

362
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,790
please...

363
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,120
kill me, please...

364
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,080
As expected,

365
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,020
you want to abandon yourself this time, too.

366
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:42,290
The sins you have committed... seem to be enough of a punishment for killing yourself...

367
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,830
I thought about it a lot, if it was right that I should give this to you.

368
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:09,120
So I had it for a couple of days. I'm sorry.

369
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,430
Why would you be? I'm the one who's sorry.

370
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,390
Aren't you going to ask more?

371
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,500
What about? I know it all.

372
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,830
Though... I didn't know I would be receiving it like this.

373
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:32,300
Someone's grudges, crimes, and longing were all mine?

374
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,640
That shaman was quite skilled.

375
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,850
But then... what sin did you commit?

376
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,410
Huh?

377
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:46,980
You said you are my Goblin Orabeoni's bride. That person and I were lovers in the past...

378
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,750
But why are you entangled with my Orabeoni?

379
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,140
It's just fate.

380
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,330
Do you also do something strange? Do you perhaps fly? Like a bird?

381
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,920
I don't do those things.

382
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:07,330
<i>An extinction tool to end the Goblin's immortality,</i>

383
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,370
<i>that is the Goblin bride's fate.</i>

384
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:15,860
<i>The moment you pull the sword out, like dust in the wind,</i>

385
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,720
<i>he will scatter. In this world...</i>

386
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,860
<i>or to another world somewhere, forever.</i>

387
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,130
Part-timer?

388
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,490
I... just can make it rain less,

389
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:42,190
so it isn't inconvenient for people. I can also make the first snow come sooner

390
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,270
to excite the world's people.

391
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,100
You do the most important work.

392
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:53,490
But, why did my brother become a goblin?

393
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:58,570
Because the world needs miracles

394
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,030
- that are weird and beautiful. <br> -Says who?

395
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,030
Me.

396
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,950
Okay. Then what about the Grim Reaper?

397
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,010
Because people all die in the end?

398
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:18,310
Since life is splendid because there is death.

399
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,800
Look how good you are with words. As expected of a university student.

400
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,710
Long time no see.

401
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:43,110
The lowly warrior's sister, a queen from a lowly military family...

402
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,660
Why? Is something there?

403
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:55,400
You stay out of it. It's not your turn yet. Yours is after that wench's.

404
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,080
Don't come close. Boss, get me the lighter from my coat, quickly!

405
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,650
Lighter? Why a lighter?

406
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:06,930
Yeo was like my son.

407
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,680
That wench ruined everything.

408
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,850
I will kill her.

409
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:14,000
- Boss, quickly! <br> - Alright.

410
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,310
This wench!

411
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,120
Part-timer! What's wrong? What? What is it?

412
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,180
Come to your senses! Part-timer!

413
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:44,030
Are you okay? Can you walk?

414
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,870
Yes, I'm fine. You must have been startled.

415
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:51,570
Of course, I was startled. Who were you talking to earlier?

416
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:55,930
That blue thing, that thing like light, what was that? You said you were human.

417
00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:01,260
Perhaps, are you a human that isn't a human that is similar to a human?<br> (referring to the song, "Some")

418
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:06,760
That was a first for me, too. Boss, you go inside first.

419
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,830
I'll come in after seeing your Orabeoni.

420
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,210
He's coming?

421
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,750
If I call him, he has no choice.

422
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,020
How are you?

423
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:40,390
♬ <i> Heaven is in your eyes, heaven is in </i> ♬

424
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,700
- I missed you. <br>♬ <i> Your sound </i> ♬

425
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,450
♬ <i> You show me </i> ♬

426
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,390
- Me, too. <br>♬ <i> All of the world </i> ♬

427
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,350
- Have you been well? <br>-♬ <i> Heaven is in your kiss </i> ♬

428
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:58,140
- I'm sorry. I'll soon come to get you.<br>♬ <i> Even though tears fall down <i> ♬</i></i>

429
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:06,240
♬ <i> My one and only laugh underneath the sky </i> ♬

430
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,050
The mark on your neck...

431
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:10,570
Why?

432
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,110
It's almost invisible.

433
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:14,920
Is that so?

434
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:18,940
- I wonder why? <br> - The fact that it's this faded

435
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,150
means that I've put you in that much danger.<br> And that I might not be able to sense you from now on.

436
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:28,040
Don't worry. I will be more cautions and careful.

437
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,930
Perhaps, did you see him again, Park Joong Hun?

438
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,240
I did but...

439
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,720
I wasn't his target.

440
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,650
My boss was his target.

441
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,430
That isn't something for you to worry about, either. Just worry about yourself

442
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:47,240
since someone else will protect my sister.

443
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,490
Just two more days.

444
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:54,300
<i> Fate is the question I threw. The answer...</i>

445
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,270
<i>you two find it.</i>

446
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,990
We received a question,

447
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:07,270
and the Grim Reaper and I have to find the answer.

448
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,940
<i> [Park Joong Hun] </i>

449
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:31,880
<i> [Park Joong Hun, died in the 14th year of the sexagenary cycle, April.] </i>

450
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,620
<i>[He did not respond to the call by the Grim Reaper and fled.]</i>

451
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,890
<i> [I met the man again in the year 1997 </i>

452
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:46,540
<i>but he fled again and I was not able to capture him.] </i>

453
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,350
What is it about?

454
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,250
The papers for the Miscellaneous Omitted Person I told you about...

455
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,150
The one that got away 20 years ago?

456
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:02,630
But since I am on standby, I can't process it.

457
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,260
So you have to do it. Listen to me carefully.

458
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,430
- I'm listening. <br> - He's a soul that's been wandering around for 900 years

459
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:13,430
and feeding off of the dark emotions of humans. He has managed to stay alive until now.

460
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:17,380
Even if we come across him, it will be hard with just our own strength.

461
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,380
But if we put his name on the list, I think we can at least control him for now.

462
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,320
Please take care of it quickly. It is an urgent matter.

463
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,120
- Until noon tomorrow-- <br>- Today by midnight.

464
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:33,140
- Thank you. <br>- I have something to say as well.

465
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:37,790
I thought you should know. I saw this when I was assigned to your area.

466
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:40,150
The name on the list, Ji Eun Tak,

467
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:44,200
this person, isn't she the Goblin's bride from before?

468
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,450
I saw the date, and--

469
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:50,740
Don't say it. Take your hand off the name card.

470
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,660
I looked at it. You don't know anything.

471
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,870
<i> [Ji Eun Tak] <i></i></i>

472
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,120
It's in a week...

473
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,790
<i> It's not your turn yet. Yours is after that wench's.</i>

474
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,390
In the end...

475
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,640
is he saying that he's after me?

476
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,900
<i>[Yoo Shin Woo]</i>

477
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,450
Eun Tak's name card came.

478
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:59,340
- It must be... <br>- Related to Park Joong Hun, right?

479
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:05,840
- In the 14th year--<br> - That date has no meaning anymore.

480
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,300
- You know that. <br>- But still...

481
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,370
I thought it would be good if you knew.

482
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,840
Park Joong Hun...

483
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,690
is lingering around my sister.

484
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,360
Protect her.

485
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,490
At least once protect my sister, like how my sister protected you.

486
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,340
That day...

487
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:42,630
<i>the path to the king was too far...</i>

488
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,580
<i>and in the end I couldn't reach him.</i>

489
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:52,500
<i>I knew I couldn't get to him. I knew that but all that I could do was to keep going forward.</i>

490
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:57,420
That day, for what did you keep on going forward?

491
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,350
When that place...

492
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,450
you knew all too well that it was going to be your grave.

493
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,290
To tell you what I wasn't able to before.

494
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,200
After I received the sword,

495
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,380
I asked to see you countless times, but the king who was also my brother-in-law

496
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,550
only ordered for me to travel to west-by-southwest.

497
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:39,060
Only when you were sure that I would die, you showed your face.

498
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,790
So...

499
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:45,100
by going that far... what did you want to say?

500
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:49,090
- The former king--<br><i>- By not taking care of him</i>

501
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:52,050
<i>I took care of him, tell him that.</i>

502
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:55,240
He took care of you by not caring for you.

503
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,600
From the late king who was your half-brother,

504
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:04,440
from your lover who was my sister, from me who protected your Goryeo,

505
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,460
that you received love.

506
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:21,150
And to tell you just one thing, "I will give you a sword filled with rage and concern,

507
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,350
so behead Park Joong Hun."

508
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:27,920
Just that one thing...

509
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,410
But that sword...

510
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:41,340
I didn't know would be in my chest, instead.

511
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,770
How could it...?

512
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:06,870
<i> It's been 900 years for you and I both. </i>

513
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:11,280
<i> You can't kill me with a mere sword.</i>

514
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,200
I came this far...

515
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,850
but I end up holding this sword again.

516
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,070
What's wrong?

517
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,410
Is the sword hurting again?

518
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,540
The purpose of this sword, in the end...

519
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:55,360
was that.

520
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,490
To take out Park Joong Hun.

521
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,380
<i>Are you an engineer?</i>

522
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,290
<i>The final point to a phone number... are the lips.</i>

523
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:48,050
<i> ♫ I don’t know why ♫ </i>

524
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,740
<i> ♫ My tears keep falling ♫ </i>

525
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:52,530
I'm going crazy, seriously.

526
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:55,710
You need to look pretty. Stop crying.

527
00:55:55,710 --> 00:56:03,970
<i> ♫ You always turned around and came back to me♫ </i>

528

533
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:55,330

538
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,090
It's been a few days already. Are you a stalker?

539
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:21,270
<i> ♫ I love you, love you, love you ♫ </i>

540
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,800
It's nothing like that.

541
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,730
I think our paths just cross by chance...

542
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:32,550
Thanks to you, it felt like I was having a date

543
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:33,740
with Mr. Kim Woo Bin.

544
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:38,630
<i> ♫ And I miss you, miss you ♫ </i>

545
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:42,540
Exactly why?

546
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,100
How could you remember?

547
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:50,530
Because you put the wrong spell on me.

548
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:56,850
<i>The hard and sad moments... forget them.</i>

549
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:03,240
<i>Be it the past life or the present life.</i>

550
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:08,610
<i>And also... forget me, too.</i>

551
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:14,420
<i>And in this way... I hope that at least you will have a happy ending.</i>

552
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:24,440
<i> ♫ Don’t leave my side ♫ </i>

553
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:32,330
Asking me to forget you after telling me to forget everything<br> except for happy moments... It doesn't make sense.

554
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:38,490
All the moments that you were in... even the sad and hard moments, everything...

555
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:42,290
Even those moments, I liked them all.

556
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:50,980
So... protecting you with my death... did it become a happy ending for you?

557
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:59,060
Looking at how young you look now, it seems like you weren't able to live long.

558
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:06,440
Every day... with bitter regret...

559
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:11,100
I longed for you.

560
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,130
Then why, if you were going to do that?

561
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,110
Because I was foolish.

562
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,280
I wish you had realized it sooner.

563
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,630
But how did I...

564
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:37,650
even in this lifetime, too, fall for you?

565
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,470
Maybe because your royal face is so bright?

566
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,040
Here.

567
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,100
Let's really break up.

568
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,700
I won't fall for you in this lifetime...

569
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:07,250
The punishment that I can give you... is only this.

570
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,020
Goodbye, Your Highness.

571
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,090
Give it to me!

572
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:42,920
You don't even have money, so how did you get snacks? Did you steal?

573
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,570
No! My grandmother bought it for me!

574
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:46,750
Did she get it by begging?

575
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,960
Don't put my grandmother down! Gust of wind!

576
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,800
He's doing this again. Seriously...

577
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:56,010
Hey! That's not how you do gust of wind. You do it like this.

578
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:57,910
Gust of wind!

579
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,420
Gust of wind!

580
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,000
Hey, you rascals, again!

581
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,030
Gust of wind!

582
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,200
What? It was real?

583
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,000
Are you okay?

584
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:28,790
Noona, how did you know?

585
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:32,230
You said to me last time that I would be able to shoot a real gust of wind.

586
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:35,620
I really shot it! Gust of wind!

587
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:39,940
When I was your age, I also thought how I should become a Goblin's bride

588
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,100
and I really became one.

589
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:48,670
But it's a secret. Gusty winds and such are very dangerous so you can't just shoot it anywhere.

590
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:50,430
Understand?

591
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:54,870
I will tell just my grandmother.

592
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,130
That's pretty cool.

593
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,450
If it's cool then let's go on a trip.

594
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,860
- Wow!<br>- Why?

595
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,210
My heart just dropped.

596
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:15,210
That's good. You said you liked that.

597
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:18,320
You seem to be in a good mood.

598
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:25,190

Oh! This.

620
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:09,960
Now that you are an adult, remember. Usually each person gets one.

621
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,700
So that's why I forged it,

622
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,920
but then I got caught.

623
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,600
But which one is the original?

624
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,220
So it's that one?

625
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:26,610
- Give me that.<br>- I don't want to.

01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:32,280
I will be back.

692
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:43,400
<i> ♫ We go where... apart... ♫ </i>

693
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:04,090
Didn't I tell you already...

694
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:08,430
you can't take me out with a mere sword made from water.

695
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,360
I know that.

696
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,010
So should we go to our last war?

697
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:21,120
How do you know where I will be going?

698
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:55,140
<i>But buckwheat flowers... what do they mean?</i>

699
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,900
<i>Lovers.</i>

700
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:35,860
As expected, you can't see me anymore.

701
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:57,590
<i>[Ji Eun Tak: 20 years old, March 11, 2017, 18:47. Heart attack.]</i>

702
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:00,310
<i>[Ji Eun Tak: 20 years old, March 11, 2017, 18:47. Heart attack.]</i>

703
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:14,500
It was because of me.

704
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:21,590
He was waiting for my mark to disappear...

705
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:23,950
Impressive.

706
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:26,330
However, it's too late.

707
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:28,470
By using me...

708
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:34,890
he plans to take the sword out.

709
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:42,250
It's now. Summon me.

710
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:55,070
Don't be resentful.

711
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:58,550
This is your fate.

712
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,390
Don't be resentful.

713
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:19,750
This is your fate.

714
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,330
Are you alright?

715
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:48,590
Ji Eun Tak!

716
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,370
I found out. I found out the reason why he appeared now.

717
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:59,750
Strike me. Hurry.

718
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:03,610
It will be the end if he goes into my body. He's trying to use my hands to take the sword out!

719
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:08,500
If not for you... I was fated to die anyway...

720
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,470
Hurry up and strike me!

721
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:18,620
<i>What this child said was right. You should have killed her.</i>

722
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:21,840
<i>Now it's either you die or I die.</i>

723
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,050
<i>But because you keep looking back...</i>

724
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,640
<i>I guess you will die by my hands.</i>

725
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,970
<i>Park Joong Hun,</i>

726
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:01,610
a deceased should answer the call of the Grim Reaper.

727
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:04,390
- Insolent!<br>- Park Joong Hun!

728
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:06,870
Park Joong Hun!

729
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:22,730
So I go like this.

730
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:29,390
However, it is not for naught since I killed you again.

731
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:36,500
Look.

732
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:43,230
In the end... it is destruction.

733
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:28,830
Please forgive me.

734
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:38,480
Dying an honorable death...

735
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:44,790
Only now... I am able to notify you.

736
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:03,540
You can't!

737
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:28,110
No! No!

738
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,000
You can't!

739
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:42,150
♬ <i> And I'm here, like I used to be </i> ♬

740
01:19:49,130 --> 01:20:00,080

♬ <i> All my fears </i> ♬

743
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:13,190
Because I met you, this life...

744
01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:17,030
was a reward.

745
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:18,910
No, I don't want this...

746
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,060
Please...

747
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:27,470
♬ <i> No matter </i> ♬

748
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:32,020
You promised you wouldn't let go of my hand.

749
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:36,100
You promised.

750
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:41,370
I will come as rain...

751
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:45,030
♬ <i> When you feel </i> ♬

752
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:48,790
I will come as the first snow.

753
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:52,160
So that I could at least do that...

754
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,590
♬ <i> I'll be here </i> ♬

755
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:56,940
I will beg God.

756
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:00,870
Don't!

757
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:06,550
Don't go like that!

758
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:15,070
I love you...

759
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:19,360
I love you. I love you.

760
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:24,110
I do, too.

761
01:21:28,570 --> 01:21:31,940
♬ <i> If I could fly above the clouds </i> ♬

762
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:37,740
I love you.

763
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:41,550
♬ <i> I can hold you for a while </i> ♬

764
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:43,140
Even that...

765
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:46,930
♬ <i> To let you feel my pulse </i> ♬

766
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:51,720
I already did that.

767
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:55,880
♬ <i> All alone </i> ♬

768
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:06,290
♬ <i> My whole life and all my heart </i> ♬

769
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:16,670
