2
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,120
It's a new face. It's the one that I told you before who was wandering for a long time with a lot of know-hows.

3
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,670
Ah...

4
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,510
20 years ago,

5
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,650
he met a grim reaper and ran away.

6
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,330
Was it about 20 years ago? I bumped into a deceased person.

7
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,480
It was a deceased person without any information.

8
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,610
Really? I also had a similar experience when I was nine years...

9
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,690
<i>It seemed like he was wandering this life for a long time. He seemed to have no fear.</i>

10
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,020
<i>It was my first time seeing a deceased person <br>that was not afraid of a grim reaper. It was fascinating.</i>

11
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,950
Nice to meet you.

12
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,480
So you are that Goblin's Bride.

13
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,180
Yes. Same to you.

14
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,410
Now, if you gather in someone else's business place

15
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,220
there won't be any customers. Now we have to do business so you should all leave.

16
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,720
- Cold-hearted girl.<br>- Starting with you, Unni. Hurry, hurry.

17
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,460
<i>That unfriendly brat!</i>

18
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,710
The feeling is a bit...

19
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,450
In my horrorific life of 20 years, it's my first time seeing that.

20
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,110
Let's forget it. Forget it. I'm so busy so I have no time to think about a ghost.

21
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,340
If I move it all to the middle of the week...

22
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,050
I should push my part-time hours...

23
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,690
A love letter? What nonsense.

24
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,560
I am too busy living, and what? A love letter?

25
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,680
<i>I am...</i>

26
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,190
<i>a grim reaper.</i>

27
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,080
I want to meet him.

28
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,250
I don't want to meet him.

29
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,060
I want to meet him.

♫ <i> I love you, love you, love you </i>♫

31
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,390
How could I run out of it after 7 glasses?

32
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,790
<i>Even after knowing I would finish it in 7 glasses,</i>

33
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,720
I started with I wanted to meet him.

34
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,320
I want to meet him. I don't want to meet him.

35
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,110
I want to meet him.

36
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,920
You... have you ever been hit by a peach blossom?

37
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,930
I have. I went to see a shaman and I got beat up. The effect lasts a long time, you know.

38
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,620
The earlier one was better.

39
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,080
Right? The one before was better.

40
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,350
But then... have you ever thought of wanting to find your memories?

41
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,690
No.

42
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,680
What are forgotten memories? Isn't it the same as no memories?

43
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,920
It wasn't there from the beginning, so why...

I... miss that.

47
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,830
Don't. We are all sinners.

48
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,560
How do you know what's behind that longing?

49
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,080
I know.

50
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,040

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,380
You seem to be drinking too much today.

57
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,470
I got caught... That I'm a grim reaper by Sunny.

58
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,490
Nice going. Good job.

59
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,120
In the middle of winter, where could she have found a peach blossom branch?

60
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,450
- I know, right?<br>- What do I do now?

61
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,200
- She must be so confused.<br>- About what?

62
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,160
Since it came to this, hold her hand once more. See if I am in there or not.

63
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,350
- I got caught, I said.<br>- Since you're caught, hold her hand.

64
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,020
See if my face is there or not.

65
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,980
You have no idea. Do you know how hard it is to see a past life?

66
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,240
It's like someone pushing forcibly in. In an instant!

67
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,540
The face that I only saw in a painting, to see it vividly in person, was so beautiful that it made me lose my...

68
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,780
It's my sister.

69
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,740
...mind.

70
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,080
I just saw one young and foolish looking face. That young king's.

71
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,810
She must have thought of that dummy, my ugly.

72
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,630
She doesn't care about her Orabeoni.

73
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,230
I am here. Why?

74
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,210
No, next time.

75
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,660
Give it to me! Why are you going through someone else's notebook?

76
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,750
Why is my writing in someone else's notebook then?

77
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,220
What is this? Did you forge a document without me knowing?

78
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,380
Feigning ignorance. It's a love letter. The one that you wrote.

79
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,090
You wrote a love letter?

80
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,240
He did. To his first love. What kind of grand love story is it?

81
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,640
I was curious about the ending, so I was going to ask for your help.

82
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,870
What do you mean? This is not a love letter.

83
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,500
As if! It was very well written.

84
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,600
"One day after living a hundred years,

85
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,530
on a day that was just right..." Huh?

86
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,310
- It's not the contents though.<br>- Yes, they are.

87
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,070
- Deok Hwa Oppa read it all to me.<br>- <i>One day after living for a hundred years like that,</i>

88
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,360
<i>on a day that's just right...</i>

89
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,980
That can't be. There's no way Deok Hwa can read this even if he came from the dead.

90
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,360
Those are words that I kept to myself that is not recorded anywhere.

91
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,280
<i>One day after living for a hundred years,</i>

92
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,940
<i>on a day that was just right,</i>

93
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,380
<i>I wish I could confess that it was first love...</i>

94
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,930
That's right. It's not what it says.

95
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,500
That's not right. Deok Hwa Oppa translated it for me.

96
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,150
<i>It's a love letter.</i>

97
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,540
Last time,

98
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,130
when you wrecked a lot of cars, did you perhaps tell Deok Hwa

99
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,180
that I could help with erasing memories?

100
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,030
- No.<br>- <i>Uncle down the hall, you have to go somewhere with me.</i>

101
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,330
But how did he know to ask for me to help?

102
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,440
Now that I think about it, Deok Hwa Oppa also found my maple leaf.

103
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,720
Something that I completely lost.

104
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,830
<i>This maple leaf, try to guess where this is from.</i>

105
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,710
What is this?

106
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,040
<i>Wow. That's pretty cool.</i>

107
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,920
<i>Wow. That's pretty cool.</i>

108
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,260
Why did I not know?

109
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,080
He even dared to put the Goblin's house for rent.

110
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,960
<i>If it was the king, God or me.</i>

111
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,120
<i>This character is to hear, "cheong."</i>

112
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,240
<i>I found that girl. She's at a ski resort.</i>

113
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,480
<i>That is because your boss was my uncle's younger sister in her past life.</i>

114
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,530
<i>Should we have a drink?</i>

115
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,960
<i>Finally, the Goblin and the Goblin's Bride meet.</i>

116
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,010
<i>It's fate.</i>

117
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,910
<i>Why involve Wang Yeo?</i>

118
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,220
<i>How could you make the person who got stabbed meet the person who stabbed him?</i>

119
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,390
<i>- What brings you to my house?<br>- You live here?</i>

120
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,510
<i>That is also fate.</i>

121
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,690
<i>- He was also coincidentally looking for a house.<br>- You should bring it down a notch.</i>

122
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,680
<i>What on earth are you thinking?</i>

123
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,130
<i>I love him particularly.</i>

124
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,910
<i>Kim Shin has been punished for 900 years already. Is that still not enough?</i>

125
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,150
<i>Such is the weight of a person's life.</i>

126
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,250
<i>You should have just created a perfect world without sins from the first place, then.</i>

127
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,380
<i>Then they won't seek God.</i>

128
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,790
<i>They are children I've blessed with love. Stop bothering them.</i>

129
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,750
<i>Stop covering that child's eyes, too. Leave them alone to recognize each other,</i>

130
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,260
<i>whatever decision they make.</i>

131
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,330
<i>That's too bad. I liked his good looks.</i>

132
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,430
They're finally here.

133
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,840
Deok Hwa, you...

134
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,760
Who are you? Let's introduce ourselves.

135
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,010
<i>God of stars! God of heavens!</i>

136
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,490
<i>Don't pray to anyone. God is not listening.</i>

137
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,810
"God is still not listening."

138
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,800
You were complaining.

139
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,700
"God must have a reason to erase my memories."

140
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,580
<i>If we remember, then we do, if we don't, then we don't. It must be God's intentions.</i>

141
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,780
You were guessing my intentions.

142
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,680
I was always listening. Since you were pleading for death, I gave you a chance.

143
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,270
But then, why are you still alive?

144
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:18,830
I have never erased your memory. You chose to have it erased. Even then,

145
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,280
does it seem like God's plan or a mistake?

146
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:30,590
God just questions. Fate is the question I throw, the answer...

147
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,660
you can find it.

148
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,620
My goodbye to this child,

149
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,570
you can, too... Then,

150
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,360
I'll get going.

151
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,120
Uncles, why are you here? When did you come?

152
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,110
Why am I on the ground?

153
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,430
Awesome! Did I just black out?

154
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,280
With just one drink?

155
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:50,080
Whoever you are, let me hit you once.

156
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,270
Why are you doing that to the child? He's innocent.

157
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,280
That person?

158
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,430
- I am sorry for always saying, "Let's go somewhere." <br> - What?

159
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,450
What's wrong with him, Uncle?

160
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,350
How can you say... Are you really Deok Hwa?

161
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,750
Hey! The butterfly! Butterfly man!

162
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,290
- Uncle, you're drunk!<br>- Come here!

163
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:17,260
Time. I'll talk. Let go of me. Let go.

164
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,720
So hot. Hot.

165
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,330
But it's really delicious.

166
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,940
The man turns out to be a grim reaper.

167
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,410
- How did you know?<br>- How did you know?

168
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,650
I witnessed a very strange moment.

169
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:41,770
I somehow had a connection with him since I was young.

170
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:46,540
I'm sorry for not telling you. But then, Mr. Kim Woo Bin as a grim reaper

171
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,760
is really kind and gentle.

172
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,100
Are there any obsessive girl ghosts that follow him?

173
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,520
That was the first thought I had.

174
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,400
He doesn't match with my conditions. I'm out of his league. It's this life and the afterlife.

175
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,100
How could you think of those?

176
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,690
I thought of this, if that person is a grim reaper,

177
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:13,090
then the person who claims to be my Orabeoni must have really lived close to a thousand years.

178
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,030
Is that right? So are you the wife?

179
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,930
- Goblin's wife?<br>- Technically,

180
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,990
I'm the "husband," since I'm the breadwinner.

181
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,110
This is crazy.

182
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,970
But you know, Boss, even if you hang around our house

183
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,590
the probability of meeting Mr. Kim Woo Bin is slim.

184
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,750
It's an occupation that requires a lot of overtime. Just call him.

185
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,850
How could I call after hearing him say that we broke up? If he calls

186
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,790
then I'd force myself to answer it. Just cooperate.

187
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,880
Yes.

188
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,100
But then, Boss, I'm so sorry.

189
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,420
- Sure, do that.<br>- I haven't said anything yet.

190
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,380
Weren't you going to ask to have your hours adjusted <br>since you're a college student, now?

191
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,230
Wow, awesome!

192
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,820
Boss, you are a human, right?

193
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,930
Welcome.

194
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,800
That startled me. It's been a long time since I was startled by a human.

195
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,080
Me, too. But why a chicken place all of a sudden?

196
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,430
That person just now, she lives a floor below me.

197
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,550
She knows me. It would be good to help her out.

198
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,750
That's good. Let's hurry and eat so that we can go.

199
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,210
There are so many incidents and accidents in the beginning of the year. I'm dying.

200
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,000
Please enjoy.

201
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,970
We didn't order that.

202
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,930
It's on the house. A new menu is out and you have a tough job.

203
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,250
Aigoo. Thank you for acknowledging.

204
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,600
Woah! The taste is killer!

205
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,590
What's wrong?

206
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,130
Eat. Dip in, too.

207
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,640
What's with you? How dare a soul appear before a grim reaper?

208
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,420
It's been a long time.

209
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,510
You were living as a grim reaper all this while?

210
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,420
What do you mean? Do you know me?

211
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,340
- I sure do know.<br>- Don't make things up.

212
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,260
Aren't you curious who am I?

213
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,240
How I'm so fearless in front of you?

214
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,520
But more than that,

215
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,100
aren't you curious as to who you are?

216
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,630
Go and hold that woman's hand.

217
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,110
The owner of the store you just came from.

218
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,360
People who have committed a huge sin in the past life become grim reapers, they say.

219
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,320
In her past should be your sin.

220
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,340
And...

221
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,150
inside that sin, I will be there.

222
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,830
<i>I did not erase your memories. You just chose to have them erased. Despite that</i>

223

224
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,640

225
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,470
What are you thinking so hard about?

226
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,370
A thought that I shouldn't do it.

227
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,700
Why do it when you know you shouldn't be doing it?

228
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,730
I think I might do it tomorrow if I don't do it today.

229
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,710
Don't do that. The atmosphere now is not good.

230
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:47,430
The department of grim reapers has issued a code of conduct after the incident with Kim Chasa from Janghang District.

231
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,650
- What is it?<br>- You all are sinners.

232
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,840
Don't forget that.

233
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:59,250
I feel so unsettled because of it. This is this month's rosters.

234
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,100
Did he give an answer

235
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,050
or give a question?

236
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,060
I gave you the register.

237
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,540
<i>[Yoo Sin Woo. 81 years old. February 22, 2017 17:10. Myocardial infarction]</i>

238
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,880
I'm home.

239
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,100
It's in 3 hours. The cause would be myocardial infarction.

240
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,960
You should go say goodbye.

241
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,010
I already said everything I wanted as he lived.

242
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,440
Even till the end,

243
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,900
I don't want to see him be sorry to me.

244
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,360
For sending off... you can do it in my stead.

245
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,350
Don't worry.

246
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,930
Tell him that he should be born again

247
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,950
and that in the next life

248
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,050
live freely and not be tied to anyone.

249
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,100
And that I was thankful.

250
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,350
That I am very grateful.

251
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,660
What's going on?

252
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,000
Prepare some black clothes. You will get news about Chairman Yoo's death, soon.

253
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,880
Please look over him, too.

259
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:09,690
I'm going to suggest really tacky clothes and make you always wear that.

Mr. Deok Hwa.

261
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,510
What?

262
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,140
Did Grandfather ask you to keep an eye on me so obviously?

263
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,040
You need to come with me. Now.

264
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,850
There's still a long time till I can get off work.

265
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,920
I prepared clothes, so you may change in the car.

266
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,700
What clothes?

I guess this is what it's like, being immortal.

271
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,420
Chairman Yoo will keep turning back,

273

I'm jealous of Deok Hwa. He has an Uncle.

354
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:14,350
Don't mind me. These days, I keep getting jealous and longing for something.

355
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:20,030

00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,850
Who? What face?

363
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,490
A face that shouldn't be in my sight.

364
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,740
Uncle! Sit, help out, or go to your room! Why are you loitering around?

365

I am in the middle of being proud of how useful you are.

00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,940
living with Kim Shin.

513
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,590
What kind of nonsense...

514
00:46:55,830 --> 00:47:00,060
That's right. The nameless grim reaper...

515
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,530
he is Wang Yeo.

516
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,420
If those two recognize each other...

517
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,640
what do you think will happen?

518
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,190
That's right.

519
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,620
The nameless grim reaper...

520
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:24,330
is Wang Yeo.

521
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:27,430
Then if the two of them recognize each other...

522
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,550
what do you think will happen?

523
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,120
Now, for Kim Shin to kill me or save me

524
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,850
is in your hands, it seems.

525
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:41,710
Just like how Kim Shin's death is in your hands.

526
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,830
Now that I look at it,

527
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,550
so you are a child that is in control of death.

528
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,930
You are wrong.

529
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,680
The Grim Reaper that we know

530
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:56,740
has a name,

531
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,310
Kim Woo Bin.

532
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:13,960
Did you ask what I want?

533
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,560
I...

534
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:22,330
want their destruction.

535
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,250
<i>What are you doing and not moving? Let's take one with just the two of them.</i>

536
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,340
<i>I don't want to! I sat here first.</i>

537
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,860
<i>Wang Yeo is now...</i>

538
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,150
<i>living with Kim Shin.</i>

539
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,550
I'm going crazy.

540
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,220
<i>Miscellaneous Omitted Person.</i>

541
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:36,970
Thanks for the drink.

542
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,820
I'm sorry for startling you.

543
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:43,890
Is there something wrong? Did you come on purpose?

544
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,230
I was frustrated.

545
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,140
I have no one else to talk to but you.

546
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,150
What is it? About my boss?

547
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,600
More or less.

548
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,430
In the past life, if someone commits a huge sin

549
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,870
they become a grim reaper.

550
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,080
What sin?

551
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:17,040
I don't know. But somehow,

552
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,530
inside the history of Kim Shin and his sister

553
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,680
it seems like I am there.

554
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:32,660
Inside that history, there are three people who committed huge sins.

555
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,340
Kim Shin who killed a lot of enemies,

556
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,230
together with Kim Shin,

557
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,040
the one who commanded to kill the Queen,

558
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,950
Wang Yeo.

559
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,580
And the one who controlled Wang Yeo,

560
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:51,770
the one who led to the death of Kim Shin and Kim Seon,

561
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,430
Park Joong Hun.

562
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:58,080
Kim Shin is still alive.

563
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:02,660
Kim Seon is reincarnated as Sunny.

564
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:07,490
Then I am... Wang Yeo

565
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,540
or maybe Park Joong Hun.

566
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,650
That's my thought.

567
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:17,240
<i>The nameless grim reaper...</i>

568
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:21,250
<i>is Wang Yeo.</i>

569
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,680
But then...

570
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,370
Among those two, whoever it is... I

571
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,250
am probably Kim Shin's enemy.

572
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,590
Among those two, whoever it is... I

573
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,220
and Sunny

574
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,660
probably can't date.

575
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,210
Oh! You startled me!

576
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,560
I almost hit you.

577
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,310
I am sorry, you must be startled.

578
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:14,870
Well... yes, a bit.

579
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,100
What should I do? We're already closed.

580
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:22,670
I see. So see you next time.

581
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,480
Yes. Come next time.

582
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,820
<i>You must never.</i>

583
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,530
<i>Don't give her any tonics!</i>

584
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,200
<i>Above the people is the King</i>

585
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,050
<i>and above the King is God. (shin)</i>

586
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:51,930
<i>And they say that that God is Kim Shin.</i>

587
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,080
Hello?

588
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,580
<i>Let us... meet.</i>

589
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:24,090
You said we should break up.

590
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,440
<i>I am in front of your house.</i>

591
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:31,280
Wait right there. I'm going crazy.

592
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:54,600
How could you come so suddenly like this?

593
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,450
I was barefaced at home.

594
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,740
I came out to get the ring back.

595
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,950
We still have that excuse left.

596
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:14,180
What's wrong?

597
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,140
Didn't you come because you missed me?

598
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,610
- You're right.<br>- But?

599
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:25,150
But... I don't know who I'll turn out to be...

600
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:32,450
with a frightful heart... I'm stepping back.

601
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,750
What are you doing now?

602
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,830
Everything about me is a wrong answer...

603
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,760
I sincerely hope this is the right answer.

604
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:54,700
- Don't do this.<br>- I, who is not alive, do not have a name.

605
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,370
Thank you for asking

606
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:06,900
about my well being.

607
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,060
I said, don't do it.

608
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:14,740
A grim reaper's kiss... will make you remember your past life.

609
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:22,620
In your past life, I am scared as to who I was.

610
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:28,690
However, I hope you remember only the good memories.

611
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:37,000
Inside... I wish you also have memories of your brother.

612
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,820
And also, I hope that person is Kim Shin.

613
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,680
<i>Your brother is returning in triumph again.</i>

614
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,670
<i>Among us two, who do you wish would stay alive?</i>

615
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:37,670
<i>- Your Majesty.<br>- Answer me.</i>

616
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:41,270
<i>Or have you already made up your mind?</i>

617
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:49,030
<i>Well... whether your brother lives or I live... you have nothing to lose.</i>

618
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,960
<i>You are a fool.</i>

619
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:58,700
<i>Do you wish to die! Why are you dressed like that?</i>

620
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:05,060
<i>You must be mourning in your heart already.</i>

621
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:08,250
Bring the Queen's jewelry box!

622
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:15,870
Why don't you wear them?

623
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:19,720
Do you think I granted you these for you to keep them here?

624
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:26,140
<i>I don't know anymore, whether those barbarians at the borders are the enemy or your brother is the enemy!</i>

625
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,290
<i>Park Joong Hun is the enemy.</i>

626
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,960
Your brother who the enemies could not kill. I will kill him today.

627
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,700
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

628
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:58,190
<i>Your brother's sin is treason!</i>

629
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:05,510
<i>So you should wear this and greet your traitor brother like a queen.</i>

630
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:33,820
<i>Whose side are you on? Even once, was there a time when you were on my side?</i>

631
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,510
<i>Even just once, did you have me in your heart?</i>

632
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:40,840
<i>Even for just a moment, did you ever love...</i>

633
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,240
<i>me?</i>

634
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:58,360
Do not stand by his side.

635
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,540
<i>That is... the only way you can live.</i>

636
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:11,540
<i>You'll have to decide.</i>

637
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:18,160
<i>If you'll live as my woman or die</i>

638
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:24,090
<i>as a traitor's sister.</i>

639
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:28,940
<i>The woman who loves the king</i>

640
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:34,790
<i>is a traitor's sister.</i>

641
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:19,100
What is this?

642
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:26,700
Those that I saw... what are they?

643
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,560
It is... your past life.

644
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:41,990
Perhaps... inside the memories of your past life, is Kim Shin there?

645
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:55,080
Perhaps... inside your past life...

646
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,660
am I also there?

647
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:26,910
For a little bit... can you please look into my eyes?

648
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:36,490
May all those shining moments of happiness remain

649
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:46,520
and the hard... and sad moments, forget them.

650
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:55,220
Be it in the past life or the present. And also...

651
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,430
forget me, too.

<i>[Open]</i>

667
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,810
Orabeoni, over there.

668
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:47,930
Why are you staring into my store again?

669
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:49,510
What is it today again?

670
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:53,600
Ornament? Cookies? Socks?

671
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:04,160
It's not that today, but for the payment for the sweet potatoes.

672
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,150
Let's just say that was my treat.

673
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,070
But Orabeoni,

674
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,930
did the King really say I was ugly?

675
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:47,940
Even though you were a brother in war... how could you not send a single reply.

676
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,560
Are you...

677
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,270
Are you really...

678
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:01,050
I'm sorry for belatedly recognizing you.

679
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:07,080
And the promise that I would be happy... I was not able to keep it.

680
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,210
I am sorry, Orabeoni.

681
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:40,610
Persimmon, traditional shoes, and silk... thank you.

682
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:04,510
Now, you should come and see this ugly sister of yours more often.

683
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,690
[Ji Eun Tak, age 20]

684
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:31,960
Uncle down the hall, if you're not busy come and see me.

685
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,620
Something wrong?

686
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:54,400
Just... there's something that's bothering me.

687
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,040
Did you fight with Uncle again?

688
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,600
No.

689
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:03,590
Even before that... since that day. Once in a while.

690
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,430
When?

691
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:20,230
<i>What's wrong? Are you sick?</i>

692
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:29,110
<i>[Wang Yeo]</i>

693
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:32,500
<i>[Wang Yeo]</i>

694
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:39,830
If it's that day, it's not because of my uncle. We were in the temple that day.

695
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:41,530
- Temple?<br>- Yes.

696
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:46,440
Uncle lit a lantern. He does that once a year...

697
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,460
I was told they were people whom he was indebted in his heart that's why he does that.

698
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:55,830
The names were two characters. It was Kim Seon and...

699
01:07:55,830 --> 01:08:00,410
Wang something... It was in Chinese characters.

700
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:05,700
What do you call this?

701
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,120
A horse surrounded.

702
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,810
Hey!

703
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:20,810
Look at her. She's pretending not to see me again.

704
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:28,440
You bad wench!

705
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:46,310
It's not that she's pretending not to see me but she really doesn't see me.

706
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,640
Me, too.

707
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,870
Huh?

708
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:09,680
I am also excited to be picking you up from school.

709
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:19,530
I'm so excited that you came to pick me up from school.

710
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:22,250
Forget it.

711
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:26,110
I have some stuff to think about.

712
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:29,190
Did something good happen? You seem to be since earlier.

713
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:31,770
You took so long to ask.

714
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:35,950
My sister... My Seon has remembered me.

715
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:38,210
Really? Really?

716
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:42,070
That's great. But how?

717
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,720
I didn't ask about that. That's right,

718
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,330
how did she remember her past life?

719
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,250
Why do you look like that?

720
01:09:53,250 --> 01:10:02,290
So... first, can you stop the car?

721
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:13,350
What I'm about to say, don't get mad and just listen.

722
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:16,510
I have been pondering about it all along.

723
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:18,080
What is it?

724
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:24,000
Mister is someone bigger than I think. I really believe that.

725
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,190
What is it?

726
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:33,310
I... met some soul...

727
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:38,520
and I think it's Park Joong Hun.

728
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,180
How... do you know Park Joong Hun?

729
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:48,930
I'm sorry. But I overheard when you were talking with Mr. Reaper.

730
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:52,590
At first, I thought it was just a bad soul...

731
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,520
but I'm not sure what his goal is.

732
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,780
I think that all the strange things happening are related to him.

733
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:04,420
Boss remembering her past life might be because of him, too.

734
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:06,770
You did good by telling me. Thank you.

735
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:09,870
First, I will take you home. Just stay there.

736
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:12,870
The Goblin's house is the safest.

737
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:14,490
Yes.

738
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:31,900
I was avoiding you for 900 years and meeting you like this...

739
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,280
How futile.

740
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:40,890
Don't worry. I'll get rid of you right away.

741
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:49,970
But... you avoided me for 900 years, and you shall answer why you appeared before me now.

742
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:53,170
Being a lowly warrior,

743
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:57,260
even after living for 900 years, you still haven't got the piercing eye.

744
01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:02,580
You are laughable for not being able to recognize your enemy right beside you.

745
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,130
I am here to let you know personally.

746
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:11,470
Indeed your tongue is still senile even after 900 years.

747
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:15,230
I will take your tongue out first.

748
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:19,820
After that I will rip your body apart.

749
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:25,330
I will do those now.

750
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:51,200
You or me... a life of 900 years,

751
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,580
you can't kill me with a mere sword.

752
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:07,820
Working as a guardian...

753
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:13,180
did you think that you became the Almighty?

754
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:22,400
Don't worry, I'll kill you somehow for sure.

755
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:54,210
Because you are so foolish, you lose your life so trivially.

756
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:57,920
For 20 years while you were rotting away,

757
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:03,910
he had grown so much that you would not be able to recognize... Yeo.

758
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:07,000
If you say Yeo's name once more...

759
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:13,100
Do you know who that grim reaper beside you is? The one who gave you the sword

760
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:19,230
and the one that stabbed you with the sword is precisely him.

761
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:25,100
He is precisely... Wang Yeo.

762
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:28,410
Insane words...

763
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:34,560
Your foolish sister fell for him in this lifetime, again.

764
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:38,890
So pitifully...

765
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:45,240
You can't even seek revenge.

766
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,560
<i>I heard you cried. Why did you cry when I don't even cry.</i>

767
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:03,570
<i>Who is she? The woman in this painting?</i>

768
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:07,260
<i>I don't have memories but just emotions.</i>

769
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:14,630
<i>It was just so sad. My heart hurt so much.</i>

770
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:19,070
<i>A really super good looking uncle.</i>

771
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:27,120
<i>Perhaps, have you seen a ring like this?</i>

772
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:06,810
<i>[Wang Yeo]<br>[Kim Seon]</i>

773
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:21,230
In your past life, is the grim reaper in there?

774
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,610
Have you seen the grim reaper?

775
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:27,960
Look here, Orabeoni. What are you doing in someone else's business place?

776
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:31,520
Just because I remembered my past life, you must think that I'm really your sister.

777
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:37,970
He... Is he really Wang Yeo?

778
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:42,380
I need to go home...

779
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:45,270
I asked if he really is Wang Yeo?

780
01:18:56,310 --> 01:19:01,630
You... in this lifetime again...

781
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,810
are protecting that dummy.

782
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:47,350
<i>Is that so? Was I Wang Yeo?</i>

783
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:55,300
<i>The emotion without memories... was so I didn't forget I was Wang Yeo.</i>

784
01:19:55,300 --> 01:20:00,820
<i>Was it the punishment I gave to myself?</i>

785
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:42,660
<i>As expected, I seem to be the worst one.</i>

786
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:50,670
<i>To you... and even to Kim Shin.</i>

787
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:53,120
<i>You hear my voice, right?</i>

788
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:02,700
<i>I also hear your voice. Very clearly.</i>

789
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,610
General Kim Shin

790
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:50,600
is here to see you, Your Highness.
