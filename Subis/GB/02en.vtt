00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,500
<i>[Lonely and Splendid Goblin]</i>

2
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,060
Wait.

3
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,910
But I'm not done talking.

4
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,380
Did you just come through that door, following me?

5
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,300
But what's with this place?

6
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,680
What's going on here? Where is this really?

7
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,390
Canada.

8
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:39,200
Canada? That maple nation? The aurora nation?

9
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,340
This is really abroad?

10
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,880
Amazing! You had this kind of power?

11
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,260
You do, too. What are you really?

12
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,530
If this really is Canada and if this is what your powers can do, I've made up my mind.

13
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,290
- On what? <br> - I'm determined.

14
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,090
- About what? <br> - I'll marry you, Mister.

15
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,190
No matter how I think about this, I really think you are a goblin.

16
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,210
I love you.

17
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,330
Look how you're acting like it's the first time you heard it.

18
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,190
- Don't! <br> - Oh!

19
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,600
Look how you're not saying no outright. Okay, let's go that way.

20
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,150
Think of it as our honeymoon.

21
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,700
Hey!

22
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,540
♬ <i> I only hear your voice loudly </i> ♬

23
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,010
♬ <i> I can't hear anything else </i> ♬

24
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,440
♬ <i> I can only see your eyes very well </i> ♬

25
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,810
♬ <i> Maybe I really am crazy </i> ♬

26
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,400
♬ <i> I think of you only all day long </i> ♬

27
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,740
♬ <i> And maybe it's made my head strange </i> ♬

28
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,150
♬ <i> Maybe I've fallen for you </i> ♬

29
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,930
I look really natural, right? I don't look like an illegal alien, right?

30
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,540
I don't look like someone who's come abroad for the first time, right?

31
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,100
♬ <i> You shake me up </i> ♬

32
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,530
♬ <i> You appear here and there and get me all confused </i> ♬

33
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,710
♬ <i> I keep seeing you even in my dreams</i> ♬

34
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,750
Merry Christmas.

35
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,720
♬ <i> It's everywhere </i> ♬

36
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,240
Merry Christmas.

37
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,050
♬ <i> Only I can see </i> ♬

38
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,560
♬ <i> Only I can see </i> ♬

39
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,050
Could you take a picture for me? I want to have a trace of me in this scenery.

40
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,800
- If you look here, and you push this, and you hear a click...<br> - I know.

41
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,030
Oh, unexpected. Then, take it after you go one, two, three.

42
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,700
I don't want to.

43
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,240
Seriously! Where are you going?

44
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,650
Hey, wait for me.

45
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,460
Maple nation, for sure.

46
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,840
Is this the place? The red carpet for me?

47
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,490
You feel honored to be walking with me, right?

48
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,780
Good. I was nervous you might say, "honored, my foot."

49
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,190
By the way, what's that sign?

50
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,810
Fairy sighting zone.

51
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,900
This is? Fairies come out? Awesome. It's romantic.

52
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,220
How great for you.

53
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,260
Why is it great for me?

54
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,890
Fairy sighting. You met a fairy. Tinkerbell.

55
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:27,350
I'm a little upset that I got caught. How did they know I'd come?

56
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,870
They put that stuff there so people can make romantic memories like this.

57
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,170
What's the name of this neighborhood?

58
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,550
Quebec.

59
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,740
Even the name's dashing. But did you know this?

60
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,710
If you catch a falling maple leaf...

61
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,800
You caught it? Hurry and throw it away.

62
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,070
Why should I?

63
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,240
If you catch a falling maple leaf, you'll fall in love with the person you are walking with.

64
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,120
Be honest. You just made that up, right?

65
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,750
I didn't. It's in the same category of a catching a falling cherry blossom and your first love comes true.

66
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,000
You said you loved me.

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,550
- Are you a goblin? <br> - No.

68
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,550
That's why you should hurry and throw it away.

69
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,230
Why did you want to catch it then?

70
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,830
I thought I was walking with that other guy.

71
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,830
Other guy?

72
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,230
I'm going to go close to the handsome guy and take a closer look.

73
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,100
Ghost. Canadian ghost!

74
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,810
Scary.

75
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,880
I made eye contact with the ghost. I'm nauseated.

76
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,370
You said you see ghosts often. What's so scary?

77
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,640
He tried to talk to me in English. When a ghost talks to me in English, it's scarier.

78
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,710
But this, Mister! Isn't this a hotel?

79
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,560
I know we are abroad, but don't you think this is too much with a high schooler? You were saying this and that way.

80
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,190
You said you were going to marry me.

81
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,240
Are you a goblin, Mister?

82
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,170
I'm not. Rest here.

83
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,080
- Where are you going? <br> - I've got something to do.

84
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,600
What thing do you have to do? Can't I come with you?

85
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,510
It's my first time abroad so I'm very scared.

86
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,860
A kid who's so scared runs around everywhere really well.

87
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,690
That's because... you were by me and I trust you.

88
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,040
Will it take long? Who are you meeting?

89
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,240
Oh, you're meeting a woman then.

90
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,720
Right? To come all the way to Canada must be because of some promise.

91
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,200
You must have had your reason to say I wasn't the goblin bride.

92
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,120
I got it. See you later.

93
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,500
I have no money and no passport and nobody I know.

94
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,530
My breathing's unstable, too, but I'll just have to wait alone.

95
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,440
You know what I'm saying, right?

96
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,290
I don't.

97
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,340
It means, could you lend me $10?

98
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,360
You could abandon me. Well, intentionally or accidentally. In that case, I'll need to call the embassy.

99
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,280
If I abandon you, summon me. That'll be faster than the embassy.

100
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,250
It's not even $100 but just $10 but he reasons it like that. Yeah, don't give me any.

101
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,210
Okay! Yeah? You're not. You can't give it to me.

102
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,350
Give me a break!

103
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,230
Your change and receipt.

104
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,020
I'll enjoy it.

105
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,480
This is the miscellaneous omitted person document you asked for.

106
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,930
They said it must be hand-written.

107
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,630
Okay.

108
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,400
But how does a miscellaneous omitted person happen?

109
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,350
I only heard of the existence of a miscellaneous omitted person,

110
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,560
- I never handled one in real life. <br> - It's like a god's whim.

111
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,990
Humans call that a miracle. And we call that

112
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,270
a miscellaneous omitted person.

113
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,000
Then, is your case a miracle, too?

114
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,250
It's even more peculiar. Her name isn't on the list of the living or the dead, so I don't know how to apply this.

115
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,650
It sounds like a headache. When will you ever get the papers done?

116
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,860
I know.

117
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,640
Anyway, Sunbae, I heard you moved. You're not doing a house warming party?

118
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,340
It's a lease.

119
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,990
I need to move, too. I can't seem to save money.

120
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,770
I don't know if the owner has supernatural sense but she keeps saying the grim reaper appears in her dream. It's killing me.

121
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,230
That's why I keep telling you you need to pick a good location.

122
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,360
It's just that I really want to experience living in a rooftop house.

123
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,540
But isn't it really weird? We're grim reapers, but we need a place to live. We get sleepy if we don't sleep, and we get hungry if we don't eat.

124
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm so tired now from working late these past few days.

125
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,100
These days, I live on this.

126
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,720
Oh, right. There's a really pretty girl in the new '23 class.

127
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,110
Where are you trying to run away to after hitting someone?

128
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,940
What?

129
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,770
Right? You drank alcohol, didn't you?

130
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,620
Work hard.

131
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,390
That's it.

132
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,710
Are you nuts? Who drank?

133
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,640
Hey, your limbs are fine so stop throwing crap.

134
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,930
Let's go to the police. To the police!

135
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,690
Let go. Let go!

136
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,780
Let go, I said.

137
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,910
- Try to kill me! <br> - Let go.

138
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,440
Na Kyeong Won, Kim Eu Ryong. Byeongshin Year, Moosul Month, Gimi Day.

139
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,410
02:22, car accident deaths. That's you guys, right?

140
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,080
Drink it. It will erase your memory of this life.

141
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,980
Must I really forget everything?

142
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,410
My resentment towards him, too?

143
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,910
Listen, woman. It's your fate. You're dead already. Why bother depending on that now?

144
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,380
It's better that you do.

145
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,290
Oblivion is also a consideration from god.

146
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,520
But why do you only give this to her and not me?

147
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:41,150
You need to remember what crimes you committed. It's not even the first time you hit and killed someone.

148
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,120
First, you will regret this moment you couldn't drink the tea.

149
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,650
Next, you will think about why you couldn't drink the tea and you will come to a realization.

150
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,930
That you can't undo this moment.

151
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,090
And that you are already

152
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,220
in hell.

153
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,820
Your body will be ripped in pieces every day.

154
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,540
Every second you feel pain you will regret what you did.

155
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,940
But that pain will never cease.

156
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,840
Forever.

157
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,110
I did wrong.

158
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,300
Forgive me.

159
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,060
Well, he's quite impulsive.

160
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:59,110
I know someone who is living in hell with all the memories of his life intact.

161
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,750
I'm sure he's begged countless times for forgiveness, too.

162
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,850
<i>But there was no use,</i>

163
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,690
<i>he was still standing in the middle of hell.</i>

164
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:23,780
<i>The young grandson of the grandson of the grandson who left Goryeo with me</i>

165
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,220
<i>is buried here. </i>

166
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,970
<i>I've once thought of this living as a prize. </i>

167
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,080
<i>But in the end, my living was a punishment. </i>

168
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,760
<i>I could never forget any of the deaths. </i>

169
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,410
Have you been well?

170
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,470
<i>[Yoo Geum Seon]</i>

171
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:47,900
And you guys, as well? I'm still alive like this

172
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,290
and was not able to be in peace.

173
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,190
<i> [Letters] </i>

174
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,720
Found you.

175
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:46,580
♬ <i>Through the endless daydream, I saw you on the way back </i> ♬

176
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:53,780
♬ <i> There I walk with you in my arms</i> ♬

177
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:01,420
♬ <i>Through the blurry darkness, Who's veiling to the twilight</i> ♬

178
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:08,800
♬ <i>We've been far away from my fears</i> ♬

179
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,640
I told you to stay quietly.

180
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,950
I was. You didn't even realize I came.

181
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,000
You had business here?

182
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,890
I'm done now. I was just about to leave.

183
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,080
But why is it that your grave is the only one that doesn't have a name?

184
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,240
You always leave where you live like this? How many times?

185
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,680
I haven't counted.

186
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,620
Hello, I'm Ji Eun Tak.

187
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,990
In about 200 years, I will be your bride.

188
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,470
That's not true.

189
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,020
Maybe not.

190
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,200
But even after 200 years, you will still be dashing.

191
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,090
You're mean at times but you're growing up well so don't worry too much.

192
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,370
Well then.

193
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,080
Let's go.

194
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,330
Did you live here for a long time?

195
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:42,560
From the time that place went from a cabin in a desolate backwoods to a hotel, I went and came back and again.

196
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,950
This was the first place I settled in after leaving my hometown.

197
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,410
What a shame. You should've bought the cabin then.

198
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,390
Then that hotel would be yours.

199
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,370
Is that hotel possibly yours... ?

200
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,570
What's with that look?

201
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,970
Do you want to eat this?

202
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,640
Where did you get this from? You don't have any money.

203
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,960
So I stole it.

204
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,380
Hurry, eat up. We have to eat and get rid of it.

205
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,640
What?

206
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,220
You believed that?

207
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,590
I stared at it because I was in awe and they pitied me and gave it to me.

208
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,360
But is that hotel really yours?

209
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,800
- Aren't you running late? <br> - For what?

210
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,210
For school.

211
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,330
What's the time now in Korea?

212
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,770
10 am.

213
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,910
My teacher's going to kill me.

214
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,660
Should I just live here?

215
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,650
I mean, being an illegal immigrant is better than being tardy, right?

216
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,920
I think that would be better.

217
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,170
I slept well.

218
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,180
I feel like I woke up from a dream.

219
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,180
I never imagined traveling abroad,

220
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,520
but thanks to you I could even go abroad. Thank you for today.

221
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,870
Well then...

222
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,150
Since I've woken from my dream, I should get going to school.

223
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,070
Even if I was a pest to you today, forgive me for once.

224
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,320
It was probably because I was so excited.

225
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,190
What time is it now? The time, now!

226
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,110
I'm sorry.

227
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,110
You're a senior. How can a senior come to school at the 3rd hour?

228
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,590
Did you come for school lunch? Or is it that you don't want to attend school?

229
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,680
You've turned in your application and you're done with your senior year? Like you already got into a college.

230
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,670
You said you didn't have tuition money.

231
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,500
I'm sorry.

232
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:20,410
I asked why you were late. I know you're living a hard life under supervision by your aunt, but you're not the only one who's having a hard time.

233
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,480
Everyone lives hard.

234
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,050
Just because the SAT is almost over and you can't go to college, you can't bother other kids.

235
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:32,070
I'm going to university.

236
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,910
What's with the look.

237
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,500
Go! Did someone stop you from going?

238
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,610
You are always this way even when I'm being nice.

239
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,790
Wait a minute.

240
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,780
How have you been, Ji Soo's mother. Oh, yes, yes.

241
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,600
You're too kind.

242
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:11,740
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

244
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,830

245
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,790

00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,580

250
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,330
<i>I'm talking to you. </i>

251
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,140
- Are you busy? <br> - Yeah, I'm busy.

252
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,590
Then follow me outside.

253
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,760
Follow closely, but not too close.

254
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,550
- It needs to be something so important that I should follow you closely or else you're dead.<br>- I'm verifying that, too.

255
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,800

256
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,060
What are you talking about?

257
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,700
How come you came out from there?

258
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,790
It's surprising, right?

259
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,060
That girl was able to do something that even the reaper finds surprising.

260
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,690
What, who? Who did what?

261
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,910
Do it again. I'm going to stick even closer.

262
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,150
- What are you doing? <br> - What, why? I'm being competitive. Where am I going to?

263
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,090
I'm just a monster. Get lost. Go.

264
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,950
Get lost!

265
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,770
What am I if you just leave like that?

266
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,890
What is it? What can I not do?

267
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,610
- Mr. Tenant? <br> - Oh, you scared me.

268
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,550
Why is our Mr. Tenant out? It's cold outside.

269
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,730
What about Uncle?

270
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,480
Inside.

271
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,210
No, no. Actually I came to see you.

272
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,020
- Stay there. <br> - Oh, yes.

273
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,690
You must really hate physical contact.

274
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,270
Well, it's nothing serious, but I was just wondering if there was any problems that you're finding uncomfortable in living here?

275
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:19,950
Like it gets damp suddenly or really bright outside the room?

276
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,300
I just wish your uncle would suddenly leave home.

277
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,790
I know, right? To be honest, I really wish my uncle left to go abroad as soon as possible.

278
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:33,120
If you get to know him, he's actually quite a big person, but I don't know why he's staying in Korea like that.

279
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
You feel that too, right?

280
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,480
- No. <br> - Oh, you don't.

281
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,890
But I think I'm going to come here quite frequently in the future, so what should we call each other?

282
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,150
It might sound really distant to keep calling you a tenant.

283
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,890
Uncle... is probably too close.

284
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,590
I'll get straight to the point.

285
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,900
Uncle down the hall, save me once.

286
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,080
If some grandfather comes and asks who you are, can you just say you're visiting?

287
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,130
He would really kill me if he knew I gave out the room for rent to you.

288
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,580
Who's that grandfather?

289
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,760
My grandfather.

290
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:12,150
From the first to the very last, I'll stand by your side.

291
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,200
Really.

292
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,330
I mean it.

293
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,460
If I open this door, it will be Canada.

294
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,600
It will be Canada.

295
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,970
Are you going to use it, student?

296
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,850
No, it's okay.

297
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,600
Senior in high school?

298
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,840
How did you know?

299
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,510
When you're wearing a uniform and have dead fish eyes, then you tend to be seniors.

300
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,390
Oh... fish eyes.

301
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,530
Where do you live?

302
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,420
I live nearby.

303
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,880
That's good. Take this to eat.

304
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,150
- It's spinach. <br> - It's nothing great.

305
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,150
I got it from a guy.

306
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,790
Spinach?

307
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,070
Take it home and make sure you share it with your family, okay?

308
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,600
I'm home.

309
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,570
Where the hell have you been all evening?

310
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,780
It's this time when I finish school and then come home straight away.

311
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,740
Stop talking back.

312
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,220
- Mom, I'm hungry. <br> - Me, too, you rascal.

313
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,850
Oh, geez. Other families' kids are good at staying out.

314
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,610
Hurry up and cook! How many people are waiting because of you?

315
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,270
Yes, yes.

316
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,930
Reply only once.

317
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,370
<i>Take it home and make sure you share it with your family, okay?</i>

318
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,930
Mom, mom, look at this. She's probably planning to go abroad.

319
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,530
I researched this place, and it's Canada.

320
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,660
What? Give me that. Oh, yeah, I knew you would be like this.

321
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,570
You were going to run away abroad with the insurance money? And you say you don't have the bank book? Huh?

322
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,910
Give it back, please. I was just going to keep it as a souvenir.

323
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,870
Why is this a souvenir? When have you been here for this to be a souvenir?

324
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:54,710
Oh good. I'm glad I got you today. This is how you repay me for raising you?

325
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,570
Like this? Like this?

326
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,360
Give it. It's mine so give it please.

327
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,810
She's all excited about running away, I guess. Looking at how she made kimbap.

328
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,010
- It looks good. <br> - Where is it, b*tch?

329
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,790
Blood, blood.

330
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,170
What looks tasty? Your finger?

331
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,650
Blood.

332
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,910
Why the hell are both of them like that?

333
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:29,280
Mom, blood! Here! Blood!

334
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,290
Blood.

335
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,100
Blood.

336
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,620
Where are you running to? Stop there.

337
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,970
Aigoo. Aigoo.

338
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,590

Huh?

350
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,720
We've only just seen each other recently. Why do you call me again in the middle of the night?

351
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,600
I was very busy at the moment doing something important. What are you going to do now?

352
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,630
I didn't call you.

353
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,440
- You did. <br> - I didn't! I'm being serious this time.

354
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,380
Did you just think about me now or not?

355
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,580
Ah, that is...

356
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,950
See! I was right? You thought about me, right?

357
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:10,780
Because you keep thinking about me like that, I was brought out here when I'm busy. How tiring.

358
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,340
You get summoned even when I just think about you?

359
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,820
It's not exact, but I'm sensitive. <br>So let's be aware of that, the two of us.

360
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,920
Oh.

361
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,090

363

That is...

364

It would be wonderful to live there.

366
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,470
I was still happy for a moment.

367
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:59,730
Those kind of thoughts obviously reminded me of you.

368
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,050
Your clothes look expensive and your watch looks even more expensive,

369
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,600
and it seems like the hotel is yours. It seems like you've got everything that's good,

370
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,720
but why do you still look sad?

371
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,320
It lead to those kind of thoughts...

372
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,650
Well, that's that.

373
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,130
But why were you going round and round in circles, during the night? It looks suspicious.

374

How did you know that?

375
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,480
I wish I didn't know, too.

376
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,810
I was waiting for my aunt's family to fall asleep.

377
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,760
Once they are passed out they won't even know if someone took them away.

378
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,460
I was going to sleep quickly and come out early in the morning.

379
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,110
They all fall asleep around midnight.

380
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:45,650
So are you going to carry on being suspicious here until midnight?

381
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,820

I guess you had a big dinner.

507
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:13,570
<i>and advise that people use public transportation if at all possible. </i>

508
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,090
It's raining. It's nice.

509
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:23,450
What's nice about it? We won't have customers when it rains.

510
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,110
We don't have customers even when it doesn't rain.

511
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:30,170
They're not coming anyway so it's nice to have the rain at least.

512
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,650
I don't have an umbrella, though.

513
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,740
I have lots. Take one.

514
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,870
I always left it because it's a pest to take it.

515
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,360
Don't be a pest and bring it back again.

516
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,070
Really?

517
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,510
I have an umbrella now.

518
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,540
Is it the first time you've seen an umbrella?

519
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,400
Thank you.

520
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,240
I need an umbrella to appear in my life, too.

521
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,520
It's stale.

522
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,930
Should I give you new ones?

523
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,920
Never mind. I already know what it tastes like. It's a pest.

524
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,030
You're going somewhere?

525
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,930
Part-timer, that's something only the boss says.

526
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:11,000
You just need to play hookie and play when I'm not here.

527
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,790
No, a worker can't play hookie just because the boss is not here.

528
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,680
I need to work harder when I'm not being seen.

529
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,400
If you work harder when you're not seen,

530
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,230
the boss won't know, Part-Timer. You should play.

531
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,560
She's so cool.

532
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,210
Have a good trip.

533
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,440
Oh, triplets. I'm the youngest one.

534
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,060
Let's have a look. What are you curious about to be here?

535
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,620
Isn't that something you need to guess?

536
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,260
Something's not going well, I guess?

537
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,210
I wouldn't be here if things were going well. I'd be sitting at my shop counting money.

538
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,890
Aigoo! You have no luck as far as having children and a husband. You'll have trouble with the opposite sex and will always wander...

539
00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:00,450
So, I have all kinds of bad luck including old age, huh?

540
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,080
I should lose weight, huh?

541
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,340
What a cold fate.

542
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,690
You're a lonely orphan without any relatives.

543
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,000
How did you know that?

544
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,820
Life is like a boat that is floating on an open sea.

545
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,890
I wish I could be on that boat with a handsome man.

546
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:22,780
I see a man. Be careful of a man who wears a hat.

547
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,690
A very black hat.

548
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:28,990
I wish that hat-wearing man is handsome.

549
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,140
Where are you going?

550
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:41,230
Cleaners. It's "dry clean only."

551
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,930
I feel this each time, that that hat's such a great plan.

552
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,290
So that the deceased can have a laugh on their final way out.

553
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,830
Don't seek death. Death will seek you.

554
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,420
It's a proven fact.

555
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,980
- I have to wear this so the deceased can identify me and not be seen by humans.<br> - I see.

556
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:04,240
I'm glad humans can't see it or you'd be so embarrassed. Have a good trip.

00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,490
Are you sure you don't need to iron it?

559
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,490
What era did you come from? These days they stick well like this.

560
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:54,000
How about you? Who laminates maple leaves these days?

561
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,980
The one who's getting this is from the old days so it's okay.

562
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,440
Who? You've got a boyfriend now?

563
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,800
Hey! What boyfriend!

564
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,670
He helped me find a job so I'm grateful.

565
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:11,400
What if he misunderstands you after he gets this, that you like him?

566
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,140
He denies my very existence so he won't.

567
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,420
Mister, I have a present for you...

568
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,570
My scarf. I left my scarf.

569
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:48,100
Indeed... you see me.

570
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,270
Ten years ago and now, too. Same line, too.

571
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:55,650
What if the boss locked the door. Dummy.

572
00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:02,060
It's useless. I know you see me. No one's here to protect you this time.

573
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,390
I know I'm caught.

574
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:13,420
You moved. Thanks to that I looked for you for 10 years. Now we meet today.

575
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,130
Then don't look for me.

576
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:19,600
In this life, we'd call you a stalker. Do you know that?

577
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,450
I'm going to sue you. My name's not even on the list of the dead.

578
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:24,600
It's on the miscellaneous omitted person list.

579
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,540
Though it'll be a headache due to 19 years of evidence documentation.

580
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:35,430
Then... now what becomes of me?

581
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:42,430
I'm going to die? But I'm only barely 19.

582
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:47,150
People die at 9 and people die at 10, too.

583
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,500
That's death.

584
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:56,120
But who are you with again this time?

585
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,700
Close your eyes. You can't meet his eyes.

586
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,230
He's the grim reaper.

587
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,000
No. Don't look at his eyes.

588
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,000
It's okay. I know him.

589
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,310
I guess you're working.

590
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:38,510
I am working, but I don't know what you're doing.

591
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,490
I'm in the middle of meddling with human life and death.

592
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:43,630
That's what I mean. It seems like a huge mistake.

593
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:47,370
This kid, 19 years ago, should have been...

594
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:57,080
This kid, 19 years ago, should have been...

595
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,060
Do I look like I want an explanation?

596
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:14,860
<i> Didn't you learn to pay attention to the goblin when he's being serious?</i>

597
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:18,730
<i> Watch it. I might want to meddle with your life and death. </i>

598
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,590
Let's run for now. There will be a way if we run.

599
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:24,920
This way.

600
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,620
It's okay. Just stay. He can't take you.

601
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:34,470
- He just said he's been looking for me for the last ten years... <br> - Still...

602
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,730
Even if he's been looking for you for a hundred years. Even still...

603
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,710
No Grim Reaper can take away a girl who's willing to marry a goblin.

604
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,520
Especially in front of the goblin.

605
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,090
Oh, then by chance, is she...

606
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,790
Yes, that's right. I'm the one.

607
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:53,860
That goblin bride you've heard so much about.

608
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,810
What will you do now? Are you still going to take me away?

609
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,940
Looks like I'm the bad guy here.

610
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,080
That's the one I'm here for. Let's talk details later.

611
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:15,720
We'll see each other again. It can be a coincidental meeting like today or an appointed time.

612
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:29,250
Say it. You look like you've got a lot to say.

613
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,740
See? You're a goblin.

614
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,510
I knew it.

615
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,750
Why did you lie and say you're not a goblin?

616
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:48,030
I didn't think I'd see you again in the beginning.

617
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,390
Who knew you'd follow me through the door? No one has ever followed me through my door.

618
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,480
How about after that?

619
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,260
I asked you many times after that.

620
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,970
I didn't need to correct myself after that.

621
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:04,680
From the beginning to now... and even in the future, you won't be the goblin bride.

622
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:14,130
Then who am I?

623
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:22,360
Ghosts always talk to me about the goblin.

624
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,690
They bug me if I don't see them. If I do, they get clingy.

625
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,070
I'm alive like this...

626
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,870
yet the Grim Reaper says I shouldn't be alive.

627
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,420
Who am I then?

628
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,450
I told you it's something you'll have to bear.

629
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,070
I don't think it's something you can quibble with me about.

630
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,660
So petty...

631
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,350
This is so unfair...

632
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:53,030
Do you think I really planned on marrying the goblin when I met one?

633
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,680
Tell me honestly. It's another reason, right?

634
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:02,390
By chance, did you say you're not the goblin because I'm not pretty?

635
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:05,130
Because I'm so far from your ideal type?

636
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:07,820
- It's true! <br> - That's not it.

637
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,980
You always say that's not it. You said you weren't a goblin, but you are.

638
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,640
You're pretty.

639
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:20,480
I've lived longer than 900 years. I'm not looking for a pretty person.

640
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,090
I'm looking for someone who'd discover something in me.

641
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:27,700
That's why you, who hasn't discovered anything in me, you're not a goblin's bride.

642
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,930
That's all there's to it.

643
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,780
That's what I mean by you don't have an effective value.

644
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,630
It hurts because you make it sound so simple.

645
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:40,300
You don't need to be hurt. Rather be relieved.

646
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:48,090
If you did indeed discover something in me, you'd be resenting me.

647
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:55,060
Then why didn't you insist that you're not the goblin to the end? Why are you revealing it now?

648
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,190
For the same reason I said I wasn't.

649
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:03,970
I don't want you to call me out hoping for something. I'm about to leave this place soon.

650
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,650
To where?

651
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,900
Never mind. Don't answer me.

652
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,480
I'm not curious at all. Who said I'd be your bride?

653
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,150
At my pretty age of 19, you think I'm crazy?

654
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:28,560
I won't call you out again. Relax and go on with your life. I don't need you, either.

655
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:34,600
I just think, "Oh, this is what a goblin looks like."

656
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,690
So, you're finally going to die?

657
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,840
The rumor has it that you'll die when the bride appears.

658
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,640
Unfortunately, I can't die. She can't see the sword.

659
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,790
Well, she may not be able to see it just yet.

660
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:30,300
Or maybe you have to be completely naked for her to see that. She's still young.

661
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,390
She's still young, so don't go near her.

662
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,440
Why are you protecting her? You said she can't even see the sword.

663
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,310
Just congratulate me. I get to live longer.

664
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:41,750
Go somewhere else and live a long life. I can't live together with a goblin who meddles...

665
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,990
- with my life and death. <br> - There is an easy way of you moving out.

666
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:46,700
The exit is that way.

Unni, you're all grown up.

676
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,540
Why do you look at books like these?

677
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,840
Should I say it's like doing a background check on my boyfriend?

678
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,850
It's kind of like looking through his Facebook.

679
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,460
You have to do all these things when you grow up, okay?

680
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:05,590
Does your boyfriend come out in fairy tales? Is he a prince?

681
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,930
I know. If he was going to be in fairy tales,

682
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:11,310
wouldn't it be nice if he was a knight in shining armor?

683
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:13,560
What's this, huh?

684
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,720
This is more fun. Read this one.

686
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,240

690
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:44,690
Gosh... he was just a broomstick.

691
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:51,860
I'm not going to do this either. I'll throw it away.

692
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,870
Deok Hwa, you...

693
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,130
Uncle, you were here?

694
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:44,520
You said you used to smoke and quit.

695
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,030
That was so long ago. It was 350 years ago, 350 years!

696
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,100
Geez...

697
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,390
Sorry.

698
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,800
What's wrong with him?

699
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,180
He's been like that for three hours. It's so damp in here.

700
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,180
What's with you, Uncle down the hall?

701
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:37,200
Is this a cumulus cloud? I came here wanting to ask you that.

702
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:46,100
Uncle, no rain, okay? Who'd clean up all that?

703
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,630
Looks like he's thinking about a woman.

704
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:51,850
He spoke more than three words to a woman in 300 years.

705
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:55,090
- He looks like he hurt her. <br> - What? What did I do? What?

706
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:57,840
I guess the fight between the husband and wife didn't end too well.

707
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,300
"We'll see you in four weeks." Is it something like that? <br> (divorce court)

708
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,010
Wow, do you have a girlfriend, Uncle? Is she pretty?

709
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,400
- She's 19 years old. <br> - Geez! Wow! Is she pretty?

710
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,210
I'm not thinking about her. I'm thinking about stock shares. What are you saying in front of a kid? Hey, you Grim Reaper!

711
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:13,290
I hope you don't dismiss the Grim Reaper's ability to foresee.

712
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:16,040
You Goblin, who's thinking about a woman in front of this kid...

713
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,420
What?

714
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,350
What?

715
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:25,860
If you couldn't get her, forget it. But...

716
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:30,570
if you hurt her, you should apologize like a man. Why are you sitting here like this?

717
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:33,240
Deok Hwa, you don't know anything since you're still young.

718
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,490
- Be quiet. <br> - I spoke quietly.

719
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,410
A pathetic conversation.

720
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:42,730
Uncle down the hall, please be understanding. I'm embarrassed of him wherever he may be. I apologize.

721
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:45,430
Just be a man and apologize. Be a man!

722
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:49,090
Ta-da, ring. Ta-da, purse. Ta-da, credit card.

723
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,890
- Where are you going? <br> - To the supermarket. How about you?

724
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:05,650
To the dry cleaners. This is dry clean only.

725
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:07,900
- I'll get going first. <br> - Work hard.

726
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:29,020
You said you were going to the supermarket. Is this the supermarket?

727
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,920
You said you were going to the dry cleaners. Is this the dry cleaners?

728
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,200
So, did you follow me? She's not here, either.

729
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,600
She's not there? Did you kill her?

730
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:39,930
That's a very rude remark, you careless goblin.

731
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:45,150
Going into someone's home wearing shoes is more rude, you mindless Grim Reaper.

732
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,700
- Where is she? <br> - You didn't kill her?

733
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,030
Did you tell her to move?

734
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,930
I came here to tell her to move, but she moved on her own.

735
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,890
You think I can't find her just because she moved?

736
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:59,370
Yeah, you couldn't find her for ten years.

737
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:02,420
The way I see it, you won't find her even if she didn't move.

738
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,840
So, where did she move to?

739
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,030
You know, right? Where is she?

740
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,620
It's okay.

741
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:37,110
I only slept there. It's not like it was my real home.

742
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,540
Excuse me.

743
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,940
Not here.

744
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,520
Not here.

745
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,000
Hey.

746
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:18,000
You see me, right?

747
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,560
Yes, I see you. I see you really well.

748
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,780
Let's talk.

749
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:27,910
- Where did she go? <br> - Hey.

750
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,630
You're scaring me.

751
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:37,130
- Why are you like this suddenly? <br> - You said I was the goblin bride last time.

752
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,650
Why did you do that?

753
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:43,200
Oh, that. I heard it from the grandma with dialect.

754
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,420
The way I see it,

755
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:51,890
he saved her after seeing her face. Your mom was good-looking.

756
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:53,890
So...

757
01:05:53,890 --> 01:06:00,680
like this, she was dying then her breath suddenly came back.

758
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:05,180
<i>In the middle of winter, cherry blossoms!</i>

759
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:10,600
<i>Cherry blossoms were falling and it was so amazing.</i>

760
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,700
You're saying the goblin saved my mom and me?

761
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:18,270
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you and your mom were supposed to die that day.

762
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:24,000
Later on the Grim Reaper came. He got nothing.

763
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,580
So in the end, he saved his own bride.

764
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,960
So romantic.

765
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,420
What that mister said was all true.

766
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:39,580
I had no right to hate him from the start.

767
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:42,730
If it wasn't for the goblin, I wouldn't be born.

768
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:46,840
And I wouldn't have memories of living with my mom till I was 9.

769
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,630
Did you get mad... ?

770
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:52,150
At the goblin? Really bad?

771
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,470
What do I do now?

772
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,560
How about

773
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,130
you just come with me?

774
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:05,670
What do you mean, what do I do? You have to marry the goblin.

775
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:15,030

Oh my goodness.

01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:57,290
Welcome. Take a seat wherever.

01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:01,320
No. I'm not a customer so tell the owner to get here.

01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,420
- Quickly. I'm in a hurry. <br> - Then talk in a hurry.

783
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:07,110
This lady is the owner.

784

Who did you get permission from to have my precious niece work here?

787
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:23,790
She didn't look precious.

788
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:26,500
- What? <br> - Do you know "Sa Go Mu Tak?" (no one to depend on)

789
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,030
She's that.

790
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:30,400
What are you saying? Some Tak?

791
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,230
She's Ji Eun Tak. Did she say she was that?

792
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:36,520
It's okay. I didn't know either so I looked it up on the Internet.

793
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,020
This lady... Why are you talking to me informally (ban mal)?

794
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:43,510
Right? I hate people ordering only half a chicken (ban ma ri).

795
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:44,780
Chicken should be ordered whole.

01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:51,120
You know, Eun Tak's aunt, your precious niece should be at school at this time.

798
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,400
Why did you come here?

799
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,100
I tried at school several times,

800
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:58,150
but there are too many people there. So cooperate.

801
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:02,620
I'm just worried because she ran away from home.

Hey! Are you going to take responsibility if she goes astray?

803
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,380
I will stay here like I'm nonexistent. So don't worry about me.

807
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:24,230
is really bothering me.

808
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,160
- That b*tch. <br> - Oppa, do you still beat people up?

809
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,940
You don't feel guilty beating a woman? Gender equality?

810
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,760
You can't live like that.

811

Why come all the way to my house? I was just about to call you.

821
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,960
Look. See?

01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:23,050
The borrowers live more peacefully than the lenders.

823
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:27,630
You think I came all the way here because I had leftover gas?

824
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:30,780
I told you I'll pay back as soon as I find the bank book.

825
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:35,150
This girl ran away from home. That puts me in a difficult situation.

826
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:40,590
You don't answer my calls. That puts me in a difficult situation.

827
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:47,630
I even brought my car. Let's go sightseeing in a nice mountain, Ahjumma.

How long have you been talking about that insurance money?

832
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,630
Is there any insurance money at all?

833
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:11,060
There is.

834
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:14,940
Her mom had the infant insurance and

835
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,420
a life insurance that she paid for 8 years like she knew she was going to die.

836
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,580
It's about $150,000!

837
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:27,660
But the bank book keeps on disappearing. I get it reissued and it still disappears. It's driving me crazy!

838
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:31,410
It's true. That girl has it.

839
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,310
I'm certain.

840
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:39,230
What school did you say she goes to?

841
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:50,420
<i>[Hey. I need $30. I'll pay you back next week. Get back to me]</i>

842
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,800
Student, where are you going?

843
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,190
Who are you?

844
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:10,300
Why did you run away from home? It's dangerous.

845
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,370
Why are you doing this to me?

846
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:16,690
- Why are you... <br> - Your aunt is very worried. Get in!

847
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:34,900
I'm curious. To rent this house for 20 years, it must have cost quite a bit. Where did you get that big sum of money?

848
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:40,050
People in charge of the funeral put money on the bier for the dead,

849
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:45,460
so the dead could pay for the ride across the river to the afterlife. I've been saving that for 300 years.

850
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,890
So do you think I could give this house up or not?

851
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:51,380
Wow. It's been awhile that I heard the term "saving money."

852
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:54,950
I have plenty of gold and money.

853
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:57,450
Do you need pepper?

854
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:02,180
You don't learn, do you?

855
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:20,170
That was a plate from Louis the 14th!

856
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,520
Put down the fork.

857
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,720
Put your knife down first.

858
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,170
I really don't know. I really don't have the bank book.

859
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,740
My aunt has it.

860
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:16,460
Your aunt says that you have it and you say that your aunt has it.

861
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:19,700
Then one of you is lying.

862
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,860
Right?

863
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:25,340
This girl!

864
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:37,040
What? You want to really go at it?

865
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:45,480
Student, we're very impatient.

866
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,180
Do you know where this car is headed to?

867
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:53,220
A female student goes to such a remote place and what happens to her...

868
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:57,000
you would've seen it a lot on TV, too.

869
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,430
Bank book. Where did you hide the bank book?

870
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:05,760
I really don't know. Why are you doing this to me when my aunt is the one with the debt?

871
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,190
Let me out! If you don't I'll report you!

872
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:14,620
Report? I'm the one who should report you!

873
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:17,900
Hey, jerk, drive straight!

874
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,680
- Hyung. <br> - What? <br> - There.
