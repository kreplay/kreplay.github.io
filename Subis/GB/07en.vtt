<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

2
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,780
Well, then I'm pulling it out.

3
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,040
But... why can I not grab it?

4
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,720
I can see it, so why can't I pull it out?

5
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,650
That... Did you put enough strength in your hands?

6
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,090
Wait a minute, I will try it one more time.

7
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,990
You definitely said earlier that no matter what happens,

8
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,240
it's not my fault. You can't take it back.

9
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,850
Hey, so you are...

10
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,120
- So... you are not the Goblin bride-- <br> - I said you can't take it back.

11
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,200
So stand still, I said! I'm the one who is more frustrated.

12
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,620
Hey! I'm standing still! How can I be more still? <br>Hey! You give me back that note so I can burn it.

13
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,310
Hold on!

14
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,070
I got it. I think this is that thing. I know it.

15
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,550
- What? <br> -The prince in a fairytale. The cursed prince. That.

16
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,990
What about it?

17
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,060
The kiss.

18
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,710
I was desperate, so please understand it.

19
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,750
Open your eyes.

20
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,840
This is me with my eyes open...

21
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,240
Hey, you! Just now... Are you crazy?

22
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,340
What do you mean, am I crazy?

23
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,330
To the person who tried everything to make Mister beautiful,

24
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,370
do you think I did it because I wanted to? It's a loss for me, too!

25
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,430
I'm sure you've done it many times all these years, but for me, it was...

26
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,120
- You're what? <br> - It was my first kiss!

27
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,740
It's not something that should have been used like that...

28
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,250
- Come here. Let me try it agai-- <br> - Hey, hey, hey... Say it from there. From over there.

29
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,130
Right now, there's no stopping me.

30
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,690
In this situation, if I can't make it happen, you'll ask for everything back that you've given me.

31
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,040
In this crisis, what is there that I couldn't do?

32
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,320
What's with you and this secular attitude? What are you going to do if it doesn't work?

33
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,210
If it doesn't work this time, then there's only one thing left.

34
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,430
- What is it? <br> - True love.

35
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,460
If necessary, I will have to do that, too! Instead of having this bag taken away from me,

36
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,700
I would rather love you, Mister!

37
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,200
I am sorry.

38
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,880
You even made the effort to make it snow...

39
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,850
- Woah. <br> - Woah?

40
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,310
What should I do now?

41
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,270
Do what?

42
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,140
- You're going to kick me out-- <br>- I won't kick you out!

43
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,950
Really? You can't forget what you signed off on, either!

44
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,360
They say that real men keep their word!

45
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,290
You can't be petty or go back on it!

46
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,630
So, you're saying that our Uncle won't be coming back?

47
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,190
So what you're saying is that our Uncle has...

48
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,900
left this world?

49
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,100
<i>[Certificate of Title]</i>

50
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,100
While living as an immortal, at last, he reached mortality.

51
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,130
Do not miss him for too long. Death is just

52
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,370
another world outside the door. One day you, too, will open that door--

53
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,200
Aigoo, Uncle!

54
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,050
Don't go, Uncle! I don't need a card.

55
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,670
I don't need this kind of card. Please come back, Uncle.

56
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,970
What is this?

57
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,910
Why is he coming through that door?

58
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,430
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

59
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,630
Deok Hwa...

60
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,160
Uncle! Did you come back? Are you back again?

61
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
I love you, Uncle.

62
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,930
There, there. So that's why I'm saying this, but can you give me that card back?

63
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,630
You heard it. Why behave as though you didn't hear it?

64
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,360
Uncle,

65
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,080
it's just a new world behind the door. Since you already set out for that path,

66
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,400
just go straight on your way, Uncle.

67
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,630
Deok Hwa seems to be very worried about his uncle.

68
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,500
That's right, don't worry about us.

69
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,000
Can you give me back the deed?

70
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,500
Exactly, how did you handle your task?

71
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,260
Ji Eun Tak.

72
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,890
- Yes? <br>- Perfume, $5,000, purse... Can you give them back before you go up?

73
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,860
Uncle, did you give that girl that much?

74
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,440
I don't want to. I can't. You said you wouldn't kick me out.

75
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,720
I asked you to return the perfume, $5,000, and the purse.

76
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,050
I didn't say that I was kicking you out.

77
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,360
Mister...

78
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,600
I love you...

79
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,840
I said I love you...

80
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,970
I love you, too.

81
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,460
- Mister.<br>- Shut up!

82
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,590
- I love...<br>- You knave!

83
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,700
By chance, did you burn that scroll?

84
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,180
Of course, I burned it.

85
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,600
Ah, this fellow, you go too far with your joke!

86
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,860
Didn't that scare you? That's punishment for saying your good-byes so diligently.

87
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,160
I will accept my punishment.

88
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,860
The scroll I will return to you safe and sound in the morning,

89
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,800
so please do not worry too much.

90
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,890
Thank you and I am sorry.

91
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,600
Then, My Lord, I ask of you.

92
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,630
How about trying to live instead of trying to die?

93
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,950
Wouldn't it be nice if because of you, someone in this world

94
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,930
who lived a righteous life of good

95
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,800
gets to experience mysteriously beautiful luck and a miracle

96
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,120
for once in their life?

97
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,000
The man who does not get old...

98
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,360
<i>You, at 29 years of age,</i>

99
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,480
<i>are still as bright as ever.</i>

100
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:45,720
<i> But at your side... I am not there.</i>

101
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,810
<i> But... why can I not grab it?</i>

102
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,410
<i>How come I can see it but can't pull it out?</i>

103
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,720
Has the future changed or has Ji Eun Tak changed?

104
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,310
In any case...

105
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,840
it's nice to be back.

106
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,380
Shamelessly...

107
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,800
Miscellaneously omitted.

108
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,120
Tell me in detail, what happened?

109
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,750
Ah...

110
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,650
At the start it was fairly good.

111
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,290
In the moonlight, the expanse of the buckwheat flower field and the early first snowfall...

112
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,160
Anyway, so I grabbed the sword, but the thing is...

113
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,220
I could only see it but couldn't get a hold of it.

114
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,740
He came back alive somehow. I thought one of the two wouldn't be back.

115
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,330
I know. I thought he would leave me behind in that buckwheat field,

116
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,470
but he let me come back.

117
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,870
<i>Miscellaneously omitted doesn't know right now</i>

118
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,710
<i> what will happen when the sword is pulled out.</i>

119
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:16,380
<i> Should I tell her? Then the Goblin might die out of anger.</i>

120
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,280
<i> Then... this house would be mine. </i>

121
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,580
What are you thinking about?

122
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,390
When you look at me like that,

123
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,480
- it scares me a little.<br> - You can see the sword,

124
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,260
so why is it that you can't get a hold of it?

125
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,840
Those kinds of affable thoughts.

126
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,730
Right? Me, too. Why do you think that is?

127
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,950
Like what the Goblin said, am I really not the Goblin's bride?

128
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,720
Will the real bride who can grab the sword show up?

129
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,610
Do you think she is... beautiful?

130
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,950
There's no order to pulling it out.

131
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,490
That's what I mean.

132
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,050
You don't think he will mistreat me, right? Since there's some affection from having lived together?

133
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,080
Because we have one additional person in our household, it's difficult to keep up with the cost of living.

134
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,910
We're out of all the meat. Do I have to start keeping a ledger?

135
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,320
Feeling so down like this... I wonder how I'm going to get the dishwashing done, too.

136
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,910
I-I will do it!

137
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,780
I really want to do the dishes!

138
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,200
You will?

139
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,380
But then again, you're at that age where you really want to do the dishes.

140
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,370
There is so much laundry to do!

141
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,930
I can't go to the dry cleaner's all the time with my limited budget.

142
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,950
Should I just throw away all the clothes then... ?

143
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,030
Me! As soon as I'm done with the dishes,

144
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,670
- I can also do the laundry! <br> - Would you?

145
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,180
If that's really what you'd like to do, please wash the clothes manually.

146
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,350
Being able to study well requires the house to be clean.

147
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,850
Anyway, when should I clean the rooms?

148
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,380
Having a high school senior at home makes me worry about so many things.

149
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,720
I think you did that on purpose just now?

150
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,710
No, I didn't.

151
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,640
You can obviously see that I've been splattered with water all over.

152
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,880
It'll take until evening for these to dry.

153
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,230
I'm pretty sure you're doing that intentionally.

154
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,950
Why? Do you not want to do laundry? Just tell me if you have any complaints.

155
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,690
Oh, complaints? Thanks for bringing that up.

156
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,000
You're probably thinking right now that I'm not your bride,

157
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,250
but let's not rush to conclusions.

158
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,110
You'll regret a lot later if you keep being mean to me like this.

159
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,520
Did you say, "I'm indeed your bride, but why can I see without being able to grab it?"

160
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,270
You said all the time spent with me was dazzling.

161
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,310
Because the day was good and because the day was bad...

162
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,270
- And also because the day was just right. <br> - Yeah.

163
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,710
- Today as well. <br> - See?

164
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,350
What?

165
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,140
Even now, everything is dazzling.

166
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,270
But then why...

167
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,640
- are you being so mean to me?<br>- Because that's a different matter...

168
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,270
How is that a different matter if I'm bringing dazzle into your life?

169
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,140
So, let's not be like this

170
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,900
and find a different value.

171
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,750
If you're not happy with calling me your bride,

172
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,950
- I can be your girlfriend since you're my boyfriend. <br> - I don't want to.

173
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,310
- Then let's just be acquaintances? <br> - I don't like that, either.

174
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,160
Then I'll just be a tenant?

175
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,260
Then pay me your rent from today. It's $500 per month, and you need to pay separately for water and electricity.

176
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,240
<i>He asked you for money?</i>

177
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,510
Yes! We're enemies from today.

178
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,690
We'll eventually have to confront each other.

179
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,820
All this conflict is rising from my not being able to grab the sword...

180
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,640
Maybe you need something stronger than the sign on your back?

181
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,270
For example, real love?

182
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,500
I already tried that.

183
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,910
Tried what?

184
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,230
<i>A kiss.</i>

185
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
You surprised me!

186
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,220
Do you talk about those kinds of things like that... ?

187
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,650
How can you talk about that kiss to anyone?

188
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,120
Were you that kind of person?

189
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,600
I didn't say it. It was you who said it just now.

190
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,520
- You weren't going to say it? <br> - No, I wasn't!

191
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,930
You guys... kissed?

192
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,040
Even if I mention it, I'd be talking about myself. <br>So why do you make such a big deal out of it?

193
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,580
Technically, this is my kiss.

194
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,760
Hey, how can a kiss be either yours or mine?<br> Even if we could own a kiss, half of it would be mine!

195
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,120
Fine, you can take your half, then.

196
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,550
- No, I don't want to, I don't need it. <br> - Okay, sure, I'll own everything then.

197
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,580
Okay, then! You're so greedy!

198
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,850
I...

199
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,740
can't even call her because I don't have a business card.

200
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,450
They are being so explicit about their relationship.

201
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,110
What's the matter?

202
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,790
Okay! You came back alive.

203
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,180
But don't we have to make her leave?

204
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,830
- What? <br> - Why? You don't want to?

205
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,420
I'm saying that we should kick her out so that the two of us can<br> live happily together just as we have been doing so far.

206
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,270
Who did you live with until now then?

207
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,440
She doesn't seem to be the bride, so I think we should kick her out!

208
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,220
She already knows about our identity. <br>Don't you think she'll spread some word about it if she goes out?

209
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,630
She doesn't seem to be someone who'd do that if you gave her $5,000.

210
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,850
What did you learn from watching TV shows? Once you start giving money, you're basically starting a vicious cycle.

211
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,940
- Do you want to keep being blackmailed? <br> - It's not that you want her to stay?

212
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,830
Hey, I want to kick her out so desperately right now!

213
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,880
- What? <br> - You're happy that she couldn't grab the sword, aren't you?

214
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,980
Be honest. You're happy because you didn't have to die and because you can keep seeing her, right?

215
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,520
Why? Why would I be happy? Am I crazy? I waited 900 years for this!

216
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,690
Okay, then! I'll do the job of taking her away for the sake of our friendship.

217
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,230
You would also be finding her annoying, right? She kissed you without even asking for your permission.

218
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,770
Why are you bringing up friendship? There doesn't exist any friendship between us!

219
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,400
You wanting me dead! Is that friendship?

220
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,740
Hey! You're happy right now. Because you didn't die.

221
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,310
No! It's just that I have a promise to keep.

222
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,300
I already signed the contract, so I can't go back on my word.

223
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,390
As a man, I'm just trying to keep my promise!

224
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,370
I guess you weren't a man when you gave me the house deed.

225
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,590
Hey, when a goblin is being angry... Hey, listen!

226
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,450
Reaper! Reaper? Reaper.

227

<i>You will answer my summons on the day of the first snow every year.</i>

228
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,950
<i>It's because I'm going to be waiting.</i>

229
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,630
Why are you studying out here when you have your own room? Are you protesting?

230
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,420
I'm just being close to where the snacks are.

231
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,530
Ever since you don't have to be nice to me anymore,

232
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,490
you haven't been giving snacks to me. That's so mean of you.

233
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,020
The budget has been getting tighter these days,

234
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,500
so it's lavish to spend money on snacks for a high school senior.

235
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,610
Please don't provoke me. I'm at a stage of life where I'm feeling annoyed all the time,

236
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,320
- because the national exam date is approaching! <br> - Are you being angry at me right now!

237
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,320
What kind of guardian angel are you, treating me like this right before the national exam?

238
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,180
- Ah! <br> - Why? What?

239
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,660
Do you know the answers to the national exam, by any chance?

240
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,020
Yeah, but when's the exam?

241
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,740
You know the answers when you don't even know the date?

242
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,600
- Yes, do you want me to tell you the answers? <br> - Yes!

243
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,960
- First, solve all those. <br> - Okay!

244
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,790
FYI, the national exam is next Thursday.

245
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,250
Hey,

246
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,570
- last time, that first— <br> - Oh, right!

247
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,400
I was going to bring that up first.

248
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,820
Well, don't feel sorry for me.

249
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,170
It was, of course, my first kiss, but...

250
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,360
Hey, I-I was just going to...

251
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,390
I was just going to talk about the first snow.

252
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,800
Ahh, the first snow?

253
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,440
Don't mention it!

254
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,530
Don't talk about anything that involves the letters "ch". <br>(the first letters of the Korean words "first kiss" and "first snow")

255
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,850
- Hey, you got that first question wrong. <br> - Don't do that. ("first question" also starts with "ch")

256
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,820
- Aren't you hungry? <br> - Don't do that! ("hungry" also contains "ch")

257
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,830
Why do we hear so much traffic noise when you are trying to study? <br>("traffic noise" also starts "ch")

258
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,220
Is the bed comfortable enough? <br>("bed" starts with "ch")

259
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,120
I put a lot of meat in it so that you would feel satisfied and full.

260
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,460
- Do you think it is food that I really want right now? <br> - Will you be able to memorize it, though?

261
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,600
I'll call out the answers in order, so listen well.

262
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,380
- First, I'll start with the language section. <br> - I hate you!

263
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,020
Just go back home! I'm fighting the urge to listen to your answers.

264
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,960
There is a car coming.

265
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,840
Absolute power requires politeness.

266
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,560
If you still want the answers...

267
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,000
- I'm fine, I'll be able to answer all the questions anyway. <br> - Wow...

00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:32,360
Come on... You have to open.

331
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,200
How about just one more drink, huh?

332
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,990
What? Wait...

333
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,830
Did you... fly just now?

334
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,800
Swiftly... Up and over... What are you, a bird?

335
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,440
What's the matter with me? Why am I here?

336
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,640
That's what I want to know! This is driving me nuts!

337
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,720
Why do I keep seeing things like this these days? Get home safe.

338
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,650
♬ I've got peace like a river, I've got peace like a river

339
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,710
You know how to do things like this, too?

340
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,920
Do you think there's anything I can't do?

341
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,710
What? What would you like? Rabbit or raccoon, just tell me.

342
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,560
The lighter. Mister, I want that lighter.

343
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,850
What? I didn't hear you.

344
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,370
I didn't say anything.

345
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,260
It was so close this time, right?

346
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,310
Let's just go. Who cares if you can make gold appear when you can't make the lighter come out!

347
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,270
Grab it! Grab it!

348
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:21,850
It's not grabbing. And it's almost time for the movies.

349
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,650
Hey, hold on. I'm about to get it!

350
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,640
Don't scream and put me in an awkward situation. Just tell me if you're scared.

351
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,990
You know, I've lived for 19 years in a horror movie.

352
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,230
Don't you think I should be able to deal with at least this much?

353
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,870
Oh, it's starting.

354
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,810
I want to get out of here! I want to leave!

355
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,030
Why are you like this?

356
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,330
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

357
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,210
Look! First snowfall came in the cinema.

358
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,450
I-I'm sorry.

359
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,370
I didn't get to see anything because of you!

360
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,070
I don't even remember what the movie was about!

361
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,530
Weren't the zombies scary? Ah, the future of the Korean film industry looks promising.

362
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,070
Place your order. You're probably starving from crying and screaming.

363
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,890
I'm not hungry since I ate the popcorn, so don't mind me.

364
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,870
Okay, then. I won't. I'll just take one of those. Make it large.

365
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,690
Okay.

366
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,650
For question number 7 in the math section, I used substitution to solve the equation, and...

367
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:21,370
I put cabbages on top of the x-axis...

368
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,630
not... but right there

369
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,100
I nearly fell into the trap but... Is it good?

370
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,670
Yeah.

371
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,120
Their large sandwiches are really large here.

372
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,230
If you overeat, it's not good for your health.

373
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,980
Didn't you drink a large juice last time?

374
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,380
How many cows did you eat before that? How is your health?

375
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,710
It's really tasty. You should have some, too.

376
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,480
Do you know how much this is? How can we get two? You know that.

377
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,150
Exactly how long are you going to be mean to me?

378
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,260
You took everything away that you gave me. That bag was really pretty.

379
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,020
I've never seen $5,000 before. You shouldn't have given it to me in the first place.

380
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,520
I'll do that next time.

381
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,910
It was really strange for me, too.

382
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,430
As if you weren't planning to be around anymore.

383
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,520
You told me to use them when I got older...

384
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,230
You gave Deok Hwa Oppa a card and gave the house to the Grim Reaper.

385
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:18,090
You gave them only what they wanted... Like parting gifts...

386
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,510
It's true, right? Parting gifts?

387
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:29,140
You were planning to leave once I pulled the sword out, right?

388
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,310
It's true...

389
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,020
But why?

390
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,080
I thought I told you once. When the bride appears, I have to prepare to go even farther away.

391
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:50,540
To where? Europe? Canada?

392
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,810
Even now? Do you still want to leave?

393
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,970
No, I don't want to leave.

394
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,080
But if the bride really does appear,

395
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,670
that choice probably won't be mine to make.

396
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,980
Ah... that's true...

397
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:18,210
You're going to go with her? With the real bride?

398
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,310
Will you let me go?

399
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:26,070
No. I'm not going to let you go, so just go and leave me behind.

400
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,400
When the real bride appears... No,

401
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,690
I will leave before then.

402
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,880
So just leave when I'm not around; without me knowing.

403
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,450
- Did Uncle buy you something good to eat? <br> - No.

404
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,730
Why? Are you still Kongji (Cinderella-like character) in that household?

405
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,930
Yes, the Goblin is the wicked stepmother.

406
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,020
How many wicked stepmothers are there in my life?

407
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:12,780
Isn't it strange? My Uncle is the type of person whose 1,000-year-old fury dissipates by just looking at a girl group.

408
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,150
And?

409
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,200
Ever since he met you, he's just been continuously furious.

410
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,890
You're so not his type, that's what.

411
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,020
Girl group?

412
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,630
Elders said that when you go to college, you naturally become slimmer and prettier.

413
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,090
That old man, just wait till I get into college!

414
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,350
Wow! College oppas!

415
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:40,870
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

416
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,690
Are you alright?

417
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,000
Are you Tae Hee Oppa?

418
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,890
Are you Ji Eun Tak?

419
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,520
Wow, it's been such a long time! I almost didn't recognize you.

420
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:11,110
I know. I changed a lot, right? I've been through a lot since then.

421
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,130
It's because you became prettier.

422
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
You grew taller as well.

423
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,060
Do you also go to this school? I took my writing exam here today.

424
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,680
<i>CEO, over here.</i>

425
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:57,150
Is it that guy... ? Is it him she was referred to as CEO?

426
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,940
Get up and eat something.

427
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,780
He messed with her hair...

428
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,820
I almost broke his wrist.

429
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,600
Who?

430
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,250
She moved her body in a shy way.

431
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,670
So I thought she was a twisted bread stick.

432
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,680
So who are you talking about?

433
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,240
I should just have let him play the piano...

434
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,030
Then they wouldn't have ended up meeting each other...

435
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,940
Who met whom?

436
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,290
<i>I'm back!</i>

437
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,700
<i>No!</i>

438
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:46,440
<i>My spring! Who's that stupid man? He's so annoying...</i>

439
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,060
<i>Yay, I did it!</i>

440
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:01,990
Tae Hee really became a real baseball player. How cool.

441
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,150
Are you going to have some ice cream?

442
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,480
No, I'm going to eat it all of it myself. I paid for it.

443
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,020
I didn't say anything, though.

444
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:30,300
Because it rained, I craved ice cream. Because of the rain.

445
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,870
I told you I didn't say anything.

446
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:38,160
That's what I mean. Why are you holding that ice cream without having said anything? Put that back down while I'm being nice to you.

447
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,020
About this Bluetooth speaker...

448
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,830
Get your hands off of it!

449
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:55,590
Do you even know how to use this? You can even take a picture using it.

450
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,660
I'm going to take a picture of myself eating this ice cream with that, so don't touch it.

451
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,820
What? Why?

452
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:10,970
You're being so stingy with food. Why did it rain? What about your feelings? Why? Are you sad?

453
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,130
Are you asking that because you really don't know why?

454
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,370
What? Because I can't grab that sword? Is that my fault?

455
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:19,280
I tried my best. Can that sword even be pulled out in the first place?

456
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,400
The kiss didn't work. We both said "I love you" and it didn't work. What else can be done?

457
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,560
You weren't being sincere. It was a very secular "I love you!"

458
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,090
Then were you sincere? Your "I love you" had a very clear interest.

459
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,420
You have a very peculiar personality.

460
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,610
Do you think you have a nice personality?

461
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,790
I'm young!

462
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:40,230
So what? You'll get older, but I won't. I will stay young and be beautiful.

463
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,090
You are not young, though.

464
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:46,170
Moreover, I met my first love, so I can't waste my time perceiving your beauty.

465
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,420
What? What love?

466
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,660
Are you good at baseball? My Tae Hee is really good at it.

467
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,660
Did you see me playing baseball? You'd be surprised if you did, you little thing.

468
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,070
Oh... So now I'm degraded from a tenant to a thing? Okay, this thing will make itself disappear now.

469
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,200
Have fun taking pictures of your life with this.

470
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,500
You... You, don't ask me for pictures!

471
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,270
This little thing... !

472
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,760
Who's Tae Hee? Come out here!

473
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,380
Hey, Choi Tae Hee! Someone's looking for you!

474
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:36,520
I'm Choi Tae Hee. Who are you?

475
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,790
You... You were going to look like this?

476
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,840
- Pardon me?<br>- You're the most good-looking here!

477
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,330
That's right.

478
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:51,200
You've seen me before, right?

479
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,320
I'm seeing you right now, right now!

480
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,750
No, look at me. You've really never seen me before? When I was this little?

481
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,610
<i>You can't even hit that?</i>

482
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:16,840
<i>Turn your waist like this.</i>

483
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,180
<i>I'm fine, just mind your own business.</i>

484
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,730
<i>I'm saying this because I'm better than you! First of all, your grip is wrong.</i>

485
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:27,850
<i>Hey, Mr. Little Man who's 155 cm tall! I've been living as an upright general...</i>

486
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:31,220
<i>Forget it. You'd be surprised if you knew who I was, so just mind your own business.</i>

487
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,030
<i>Then, do you want to make a bet?</i>

488
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:39,030
<i>This is insane. Who do you think I am? You'll regret it.</i>

489
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,730
<i>You're the one who should be worried about regretting. Let's hit ten balls and the loser has to listen to the winner's wish!</i>

490
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,540
<i>Deal!</i>

491
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,270
<i>This is going well!</i>

492
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,110
<i>There's a thief!</i>

493
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,990
<i>I don't know when the thief came in but he only took the piano.</i>

494
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,990
<i>He really got rid of it.</i>

495
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:04,930
<i>He took away that big thing, but not a single neighbor witnessed it happening.</i>

496
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,690
<i>This is so weird, so weird.</i>

497
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,310
I won the bet, so I asked you to get rid of my piano.

498
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:27,080
My mom insisted on my playing the piano despite my lack of aptitude for it, and I wanted to become a baseball player.

499
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,350
But the piano really disappeared.

500
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,740
So what?

501
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,690
That man who was there at that time, wasn't that you?

502
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:35,330
No!

503
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:41,710
I think so, too. But if you're indeed that person, you haven't gotten any older at all...

504
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,570
<i>So that kid recognized me.</i>

505
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,970
So what?

506
00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:00,890
Is that the only thing you can say? Do you think I'm helping you with these vulgar things just to get such a terse response?

507
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:07,280
If you don't erase his memory, there will be weird rumors about a man who doesn't get old. So I'll eventually have to leave this place! You said you wanted to live happily with me!

508
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,350
You said we never lived happily together, though.

509
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,520
You are not supposed to live like this. You should help other people out at times of difficulty.

510
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,790
Why should I help a goblin who doesn't even have the power to erase memories?

511
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:19,230
Okay, cool. Let's see what'll happen.

512
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,240
Sure, sure.

513
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:24,300
- Hey! <br> - What?

514
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,490
Weren't you going to cook it before eating it, anyway?

515
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:48,260
Good. This is perfect!

516
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,740
Why are you in this room?

517
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,270
I-I was going to clean the room.

518
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,530
I saw the vacuum outside the room.

519
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,050
Give me the thing you're sitting on.

520
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,990
There's one more.

521
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,880
I remember signing only once...

522
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,790
Really? Then why are there two pieces of paper? Oh, my!

523
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,280
Are you aware that this is forgery, trespassing, theft, and...

524
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,260
You're so petty! I heard your 1000-year-old-fury dissipates when you see girl idols.

525
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:44,300
I'm sorry that I didn't know you were that kind of person.

526
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:48,010
This is mine, so give this back to me.

527
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,650
I came here to get this back. You have no idea.

528
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:55,350
I told you you could read it, not to keep it forever.

529
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,130
Wow, look at her.

530
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:07,350
See, see. I can't tell which one's the original copy and which one's the forged one.

531
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:13,690
I shouldn't compliment her on her skills at forgery in this situation. I wonder what she'll become in the future...

532
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:28,140
He probably used this book very roughly since it's not his. He frustrates me so much. If I find something...

533
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,930
Look at this here! He wrote in my book!

534
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:37,080
<i>[It was first love]</i>

535
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,050
Wow... first love?

536
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:48,660
Right, right. He would have had a first love. He's done a lot of things despite merely being a broomstick.

537
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,330
It was a first kiss for me, though.

538
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,170
His handwriting is sooo ugly.

539
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,080
<i>[Tae Hee]</i>

540
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,520
Hi, Tae Hee!

541
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,870
It's okay...

<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

543
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,300
What am I supposed to do?

544
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,330
I got a call.

545
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:56,350
<i>[Not Sun Hee but Sunny]</i>

546
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,000
So what?

547
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,570
Answer the call for me. If I avoid her anymore, she might kill me.

548
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,620
I still don't have a business card so I can't take the call.

549
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,680
I've got nothing to say if I answer it. Just once!

550
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,640
Why don't you have anything to say? Don't you know my voice? This isn't a forgettable voice.

551
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,760
What? You said not to help each other. You, grim reaper, who can't see an inch before your eyes!

552
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,820
Forget it. But where did miscellaneously omitted go?

553
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,400
She can't help you, either.

554
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,200
She's at the ice cream shop down below doing the hee-hee-ha-ha sesame roasting. (having a sweet time)

555
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,720
Roasting sesames? Why would she do that outside and not at home?

556
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,380
Get lost. I don't even want to explain.

557
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,470
When I think about it, it's so amazing.

558
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,490
To meet you there then like that.

559
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,040
Me, too.

560
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,750
How's life been for you, Oppa?

561
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,810
Let's see. I guess thinking about you every now and then?

562
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,190
You! Seriously...

563
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,200
Miscellaneously omitted,

564
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,770
take a call for me.

565
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:19,590
Are you nuts? How can you follow me here?

566
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,660
Who is this?

567
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:26,660
Your father?

568
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:36,840
Your words are harsh. One who speaks harsh, what's your name?

569
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,220
Oppa! Don't tell him your name. Not the eyes either. Look down.

570
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:47,790
I can't take the call right now so if you don't take the call for me,

571
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:53,050
I will ask him his name and write it down nicely.

572
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,250
Resolve it.

573
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,410
I got it.

574
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,430
Just a moment.

575
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,410
One who speaks harshly, have a seat.

576
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:13,620
So, you used to play the piano but you play baseball now?

577
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,590
How do you know that?

578
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,560
But she'll just misunderstand more if a woman answers it. Whatever.

579
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,960
Hello?

580
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:31,510
Isn't this Mr. Kim Woo Bin's cellphone?

581
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:39,530
It is. Section Chief Kim Woo Bin is currently absent from his seat.

582
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,380
He's a Section Chief?

583
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,180
He's a Director.

584
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,350
What kind of a company is it, that he gets promoted within a second?

585
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:54,320
Whatever. I know he's next to you. <br>So the cafe we had our meeting in before, tomorrow, at 1 p.m.

586
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:59,910
Tell him to come as a section chief or a director but if he's late, I'll kill him.

588
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,190
How did it go? What did she say?

589
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,540
She wants to meet face-to-face. Tomorrow at 1 p.m. at the cafe you met in before.

590
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:21,650
But the one who just called, her voice sounded familiar. Is she--

591
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:24,680
Wait. My question first.

592
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:29,040
What's your question?

593
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,300
<i>Phone number, name, then your age, blood type, unmarried or married, an approximate asset... </i>

594
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:38,010
<i>dating experience yes-or-no, your ideal type, etc. You don't know what she might ask, so prepare for all those.</i>

595
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,600
Aquarius... no.

596
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,380
Sagittarius...

597
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:56,920
Age: 34. Birthday, 5th day of November on the lunar calendar, Sagittarius, type AB, unmarried.

598
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:02,360

00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,410

Funny man. Seriously.

602
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,600
Are you happy? After avoiding my calls like that?

603
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:26,780
Because I... thought you wouldn't like someone who didn't have a business card.

604
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:30,460
Then you could just answer my call and tell me you didn't have a business card.

605
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,820
Or just text me.

606
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,830
I will in the future.

607
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,610
Ms. Sunny, by any chance, your business card...

608
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:39,580
Why are you asking about my business card?

609
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:43,430
I was curious as to what kind of person you are.

610
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:51,080
My face is my business card. It says so right here. A Pretty Person.

I really wish... I could take your business card.

616
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:19,670
Sunny.

617
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,700
You're driving me crazy...

618
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,200
Not that, what about your hobbies and things?

619
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,000
Sunny.

620
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:32,670
I got it, but--

621
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:36,330
Your unpredictable actions

622
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:40,020
draw me in unconditionally as much as a drama.

623
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:47,240
Your unpredictable actions require a lot of imagination, and my awkward actions,

624
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,880
each and everyone, are wrong.

625
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:55,020
My new hobby, that is Sunny, seems like God's plan

626
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,820
but then it also seems like God's mistake as well.

627
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:09,850
How does he speak so well? Do you have a religion, by any chance?

628
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:13,090
So there's something... else I need again.

629
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:14,850
I will contact you when it's ready...

630
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:22,420
No! It's okay if you don't have one. Sit right there before I kill you!

00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:36,890
No, no! You don't have to tell me. Just keep staying seated.

634
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:41,220
I'll pretend I'm looking at a picture.

635
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:54,690
What do you like?

636
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,570
I like vegetables. Then I will--

637
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,120
Huh? What?

638
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,030
I have to go that way.

639
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:03,920
Then what about me? Weren't we going somewhere to eat?

640
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,940
Without buying me dinner?

641
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,710
But you ate a whole hot dog.

642
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:11,930
Overeating is the start of all illnesses.

643
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:18,580
The person who's causing me the most illness is right here. Never mind that. Where are you going?

644
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:22,640
I'm going to a company dinner. If I don't go, there's a fine.

645
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,230
What kind of man...

646
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:29,280
Really, each and every awkward action of yours is wrong.

647
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,450
They're all wrong.

648
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:35,430

00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,960
Just have a little.

00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:54,480
Watch where you're going! Watch it!

653
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,740
This thing! Does he want to die?

654
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:02,220
Do you think he knows what he just did?

655
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,120
Within a month, he will definitely suffer the wrath of the earth gods. What should we do, Senior?

656
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,120
That's his fate. Never mind. I have to use the bathroom.

657
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,870
Me, too.

658
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:14,150
Hey, cheers!

660
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:21,130
Pay the bill.

661
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,120
You ate so much.

662
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,810
Huh?

663
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:34,720
Huh?

664
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,680
What's the matter? Are you missing something?

665
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,420
My money...

666
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,790
<i>Watch where you're going! Watch it! </i>

667
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:49,840
I think I've been had. The guy who bumped into me just now.

668
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,120
I thought so... What do we do, Senior?

669
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,160
Really, that guy will suffer the wrath of the earth gods for many reasons.

670
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,620
Hey, this won't do. Put your hats on and leave in order.

671
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,290
Slowly one-by-one so we don't look suspicious.

672
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:08,780
But, is this allowed?

673
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:13,960
If you use your skills for personal reasons, I heard that you have to write a explanatory statement...

674
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:18,020
I will make sure you don't have to, so don't worry, huh?

675
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:21,040
23rd class leave first.

676
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,010
There's always a way.

677
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,270
What kind of a way? You have a plan?

678
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:31,570
You will soon find out.

00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,320
Hey, you guys...!

681
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,110
I need your help.

682
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:24,680
Are you going to vouch for him? He can't leave until you do.

683
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,470
I think there's a misunderstanding. I did come here because of a phone call, but I don't know this person.

684
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,580
I've never received any help myself.

685
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:36,020
I'm not sure how to help.

686
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,600
Didn't you come here because he contacted you?

687
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:46,820
Let's establish that we know each other. I'll help, too, along the lines of Tae Hee Oppa's memory.

688
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,600
I just got to know him well. Dine and dash...

689
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:54,890
That is a vulgar charge, never heard of. Where should I sign?

690
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,530
I'm this kind of person...

691
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:02,480
You have a business card?

692
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,160
What happened? Why do you have a business card?

693
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,720
Uncle down the hall! Eat this tofu.

694
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,600
Did you know? He has a business card.

695
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,410
A business card? Of course, he has one. He owns our company.

696
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:28,370
Hotel, commerce, vessels, oil, construction, furniture and all. You didn't know?

697
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,580
That's enough. You don't have to tell him. I'm that big of a person.

698
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,390
Uncle, tofu, tofu. Hurry.

699
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:36,110
I really wanted to try this kind of thing.

700
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:40,190
Like uncle, like nephew. Forget it. Get out of the way.

701
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:45,860
Why does he always walk like that?

702
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,030
I know! That time when he said he sees something when he touches someone...

703
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,430
A person's past life.

704
01:00:55,590 --> 01:01:00,350
When he touches someone he sees the past? Then how about you? Do you have any specialties?

705
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:02,930
My specialty is being alive.

706
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:07,360
You don't have any other than making it rain, right?

707
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,770
Uncle! Tofu, tofu.

708
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,000
I guess the miscellaneously omitted isn't home yet.

709
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,500
Maybe she's meeting that buddy?

710
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,350
<i>- Hello?</i> <br>- Where are you right now?

711
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:40,960
Do you know what time it is already to be not back in this dangerous world?

712
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,160
<i>It's 7 p.m. right now and I'm busy right now. </i>

713
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,030
H-Hello?

714
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,990
<i>The phone is off and you will be connected to the voice messaging system </i>

715
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:57,100
<i>after the beep. You will be charged a connection fee. </i>

716
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,450
If you've seen the goblin bride, raise your hand.

717
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,850
- Where?<br>- <i>Uncle!</i>

718
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,790
Uncle.

719
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,400
- Your uncle's not here. He went out. <br>- Oh, he did?

720
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,580
Then, can you give this to Uncle for me?

721
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,430
I keep forgetting to give it to him and leaving it in the car.

722
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,950
Why do you bother with the delivery after he took away your card?

723
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:30,380
My grandpa said he'd give me spending money after I delivered it.

724
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:35,590
- Human beings... <br>- This is how scary and convenient capitalism is, Uncle down the hall.

725
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,880
But this... He gave you the card.

726
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,030
And he gave me the house.

727
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:44,070
So to your grandfather, it must be something much more expensive.

728
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:47,420
Is that right? I don't know what it is either.

729
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:51,210
Since I don't know, should I look? Since Uncle's not here, anyway?

730
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:56,330
Wow, pretty. Pretty.

731
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:09,800
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

732
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:19,550
<i>Who is it? Maybe Uncle's old girlfriend?</i>

733
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:23,640
But it kind of just looks like an antique, too. Right?

734
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:51,790
Uncle down the hall, what's wrong?

735
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:17,120
<i>It was destined to be a gut-wrenching love from the start.</i>

736
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:21,960
It's sad, that thing called fate.

737
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,210
Love is not a crime.

738
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:30,240
So perhaps they did not commit a crime.

739
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,280
What crime did I commit,

740
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,900
that you raise the rent so suddenly?

741
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:40,540
It's really hard on me for you to raise the rent by $100 suddenly.

742
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,450
Ever since you moved in, Bachelor,

743
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:46,080
the grim reaper keeps appearing in my dreams.

744
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:51,550
I see. Also, the water in the bathroom keeps leaking.

745
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:55,060
- About when do you plan to... <br>- Really? Then don't wash.

746
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,120
You're still pretty even if you don't wash.

747
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:07,680
♬ I met you among the people who were as numerous as the stars

748
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:14,790
♬ As if I was dreaming, we recognized each other

749
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:22,630
♬ I used to be overwhelmed just by giving love but I received love too

750
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:29,270

♬ If our love was destiny

753
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:53,120
♬ If I was your miracle

754
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:11,500
- You sing well. <br>- A bit.

755
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,800
How did you know I was there?

756
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,400
No matter how you run, you're in my palm.

757
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,120
- What about the chicken shop? Did you get fired?<br>- I added more part-time work.

758
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:24,380
The pay is good for wedding singing.

759
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:28,200
But when I watch the wedding ceremony,

760
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,880
it feels kind of strange.

761
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:34,280
What about it is strange?

762
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:39,150
Just that... "Oh, I guess I won't have a mom to light the candle."

763
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:43,700
"Oh, I won't have a dad who'll walk me in, either."

764
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:46,400
"No friend to take my picture."

765
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:52,670
"Since I don't have friends, I guess I won't get wedding gift money, either." Those thoughts.

766
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,210
Funny, right?

767
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,170
That's why

768
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:02,420
I was obsessing about being your bride, I think.

769
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:05,350
Because it felt like I was getting a family.

770
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:11,040
That family that I don't have. Like fate,

771
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,200
it came to me, I thought.

772
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:28,440
Why do you cry?

773
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,120
To make me feel sorry?

774
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:34,930
No. If we argue it out,

775
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:37,890
I should be the one to feel sorry.

776
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:39,720
You know what?

777
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,940
I'm really sorry, Mister,

778
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,720
that I couldn't pull the sword out.

779
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,040
I kept wanting to tell you this.

780
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,830
But lately we keep fighting when we meet.

781
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:59,120
The timing is a little off here,

782
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,740
but since we're talking about it, I will say it.

783
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:06,080
I've gotten more work now,

784
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,550
and I'm making the preparations now.

785
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:12,920
So could you just wait a little bit until I leave?

786
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:15,120
Without mistreating me?

787
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:20,350
Until I am ready to leave,

788
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,140
can you give me a discount on the mistreatment?

789
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,130
As a test-taking student, give me 50% off, please?

790
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,030
I can't give you a discount.

791
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:53,780
50% is a definite no.

792
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:07,010
45%?

793
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:23,570
What? Are you in pain? Is it because of the sword?

794
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:54,090
Mister...

795
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,620
I can grab the sword!

796
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,500
Wait.

797
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,820
Just a moment. I'll pull it out.

798
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:15,030
It's moving.
