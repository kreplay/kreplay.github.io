00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,020
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

2
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,620
Sunny's face in her past life and the woman in your painting

3
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,850
are the same.

4
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,130
Are you sure?

5
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,790
What did you see?

6
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:35,100
The woman that I saw was standing in the center of a palace.

7
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,050
<i>She was wearing white clothes and she seemed to be of high rank.</i>

8
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,770
She got shot by an arrow in her chest.

9
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,320
<i>She collapsed while she was bleeding.</i>

10
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,270
I told you that.

11
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:01,970
Maybe not the white clothes but the arrow... I don't think I told you that either...

12
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,690
What else? Did you not see anything else?

13
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,280
While riding a palanquin

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,840
she smiled as she saw someone through the small window.

15
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,270
She smiles as she asks,

16
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,450
<i>Am I pretty today?</i>

17
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,050
And there was a voice that answered her question.

18
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,400
<i>-You're--</i><br>- Your'e ugly.

19
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,400
Is it really...

20
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,750
your sister?

21
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,690
It is.

22
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,090
Then... what happens now?

23
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,490
<i>- Episode 11 -</i>

24
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,460
Welcome.

25
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,760
The part-time worker is out...

26
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,230
for delivery.

27
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,750
Seon.

28
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,040
Why are you calling my name?

29
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,800
Seon.

30
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,100
Aren't you crazy? Are you just going to watch?

31
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,690
We still do not know for sure. So you should refrain on the skinship.

32
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,610
Are you really Seon?

33
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,670
So what if I am Seon? What's with this person?

34
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,730
There is a deep story behind it...

35
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,980
What deep story would I have with this Orabeoni?

36
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,650
That's right, it's me. I'm your Orabeoni.

37
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,820
I missed you, Seon.

38
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,770
It's Sunny, I said!

39
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,210
And also, didn't we agree not to see each other?

40
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,970
How can you go around with him even after being called a fried egg?

41
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,800
That is... That person is your brother in your past life.

42
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,480
W-What did you say? Past life, what? Driving me crazy.

43
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,040
So you made up that ridiculous ghost story just to come see me?

44
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,560
You must have missed me.

45
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,040
Who could I speak to, Seon? (spoken formally)

46
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,170
Do you really have no memory of the past?

47
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,660
You are clothed properly and you look normal...

48
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,750
Right, let's hear it out. What was I in my past life?

49
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,270
You were Goryeo's Queen and I was a General.

50
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,800
Goryeo.

51
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,730
Do you remember?

52
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:45,050
I remember... roasted sweet potato... $5. Give it to me!

53
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,280
Past life? Queen?

54
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,350
Even if I try to believe you, seriously. Get out. Won't you get out?

55
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,620
You go out, too!

56
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,200
Seon!

57
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,910
You two, when did you come?

58
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,900
Why... Did something happen?

59
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,120
Part-time worker, throw some salt down. (ward off evil) <br>There should be a sackful of it over there.

60
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,920
How... I don't know how to explain it.

61
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,120
<i>- If you don't know, then don't. <br> - Yes.</i>

62
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,840
Seon.

63
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,410
What happened?

64
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,990
Let's exchange information.

65
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,570
What are Kim Shin and my boss?

66
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,270
Ex-girlfriend... It doesn't seem like it.

67
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,290
If she was his ex-girlfriend then you wouldn't just sit here like this.

68
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,130
You should be all dark and gloomy.

69
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah. It's not that at all.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,930
- My question.<br>- Secret.

71
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,900
I haven't asked yet.

72
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,910
"Are there other guys who come to see your boss?"

73
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,390
You're going to ask those kind of questions.

74
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,240
But why is it a secret? I told you everything, so why is yours a secret?

75
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,050
Loyalty!

76
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,040
It's the persimmon that you loved to eat, Seon.

77
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,790
It's the shoe you wanted to have, Seon.

78
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,640
It's the colors that you used to like, Seon.

79
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,540
I don't like those colors.

80
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,880
I don't wear traditional shoes.

81
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,230
I don't eat persimmon.

82
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,490
As you can see, this is the only table left. Business has been doing well.

83
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,910
It's because I have been here. I am a god of luck.

84
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,210
You just live here, don't you?

85
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,070
I was on my way out. Come home early.

86
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,780
Part-time worker, does it have to be that man?

87
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,110
Must you meet him?

88
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,740
- Pardon? <br>- If you must, then go and tell him.

89
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,920
If he's going to bring persimmon, traditional shoes, and clothes,

90
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,920
he should just come empty-handed and leave with some chicken in those hands.

91
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,240
That that's the way for him to care for you.

92
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,360
I know. What's the matter with him?

93
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,400
The fact that I'm imagining these things about my boss

94
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,350
really makes me feel guilty and I don't like it. <br>But I'm telling you, your Uncle lives at our store now.

95
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,340
And I keep being cautious of Mr. Reaper for no reason.

96
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,090
That is because your boss is the younger sister of my uncle in his life.

97
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,720
Huh?

98
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,010
Why?

99
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,240
Past life? Impossible.

100
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,800
But how would you know that?

101
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,090
Should I tell you a secret?

102
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,240
Yes.

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,770
Grim Reapers see the past life of a human once he touches them.

104
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,630
Really?

105
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,610
I'm sure that those two held hands. And that's why Uncle down the hall told him about it.

106
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,370
That's right! I saw them hold hands.

107
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,360
Awesome!

108
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,050
Are you sure that woman is my sister? Did you see anything else?

109
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,510
Nothing.

110
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:19,380
I wanted to try once more, but with "I will be the one to get dumped" I failed.

111
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,540
Don't be too upset. She doesn't remember her past life.

112
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,880
I know.

113
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,010
Even if that woman is Seon from my past life, to that woman, I am just a ghost story.

114
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,270
Because that woman has a current life to live.

115
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,940
I feel like maybe the past should be left as the past.

116
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,610
It would have been better if I did all of those before... <br>when my time and my sister's time were the same.

117
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,710
She was such a warm and dignified child.

118
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,540
How did she end up with such a different personality?

119
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,930
What's wrong with Sunny's personality?

120
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,100
Only just recently you went and called her "Seon" out of the blue, but now she's not?

121
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,000
You wish it's not her?

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,010
Didn't you break up? Why are you being riled up?

123
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,290
Perhaps, if you have thoughts of dating her again then quit that.

124
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,530
How could the likes of a grim reaper loiter around my sister who is a human?

125
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,670
I think your thought earlier was good.

126
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,010
We should let the past be left as the past.

127
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,740
Before dirt comes to my eyes (to die), you can never be the one.

128
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,270
Get away from my sister! If there was water, I would have poured it on you.

129
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,070
I know this drama though.

130
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,750
I saw it a lot in the mornings.

131
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:37,800
Part-time worker, perhaps do you believe in past lives and such?

132
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,730
Yes.

133
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,450
You believe it?

134
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,990
They say a human has four lives.

135
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,100
A life where you scatter seeds, a life that waters the scattered seeds,

136
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,700
a life of harvesting those seeds, and a life to use what you harvested.

137
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,760
The fact that there are four lives like this, doesn't that mean there's a past life and a rebirth?

138
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,810
Even thought neither you or I know which life we are living now.

139
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,080
That sounds legit. Where did you hear that?

140
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,140
I'm usually good at hearing this and that as I go.

141
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,060
What else? What else have you heard?

142
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:23,500
<i>Even though I could not reach it, even though I knew everything... <br>I still had no choice but to go forward.</i>

143
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,350
<i>That place was my last war and I was to die there.</i>

144
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,940
<i>Exactly why?</i>

145
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:38,040
<i>I defied the command and came back. I disregarded the young king's jealousy and fear.</i>

146
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,840
<i>I did not heed the last king's will to keep Yeol safe.</i>

147
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,250
<i>I saved the lives of the innocent.</i>

148
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,010
<i>And above all,</i>

149
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,790
<i>my sister died protecting that dummy.</i>

150
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:01,410
That the person named Kim Seon was a very brave person in front of love.

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,780
Lead the way, part-timer. To the house of the man <br>who claims to be my Orabeoni (brother) in my past life.

152
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,340
Pardon?

153
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,310
I'm back.

154
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,910
We have a guest, everyone...

155
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,700
You live together, the both of you?

156
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,710
Like this, the three of us. But what brings you here?

157
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,360
"Have a seat" should be first!

158
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,200
Have a seat, Boss. Should I get you something to drink?

159
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,410
Do you have alcohol? Soju.

160
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,340
- Pardon?<br>- We have beer. Since we only drink beer.

161
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,830
I didn't say you could talk to me.

162
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,710
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,390
How, with that personality...

164
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,220
I heard I'm your younger sister.

165
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,670
You said it was a ghost story.

166
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,840
Show me some evidence. I'm to be blamed for being swayed into this, too,

167
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,710
but I didn't think that two grown men would team up just to play a prank on me.

168
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,650
Is this your proof?

169
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,980
So, where did you buy it?

170
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,940
Insadong?

171
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,920
This person is that queen?

172
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,860
Your sister?

173
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,830
It's so fascinating. Boss always waited for a king.

174
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,640
Does anything... come to mind?

175
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,990
Just... she's young

176
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,000
and pretty.

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,280
When I was this age I was ugly.

178
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,890
So what happened to this queen?

179
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,970
Did she live happily ever after?

180
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
You two should talk.

181
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,140
We will give you space.

182
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,630
Was she unhappy, this Queen?

183
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,150
Compared to the days when I saw her face,

184
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,510
there were more days where I saw her through her letters.

185
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,640
Those times when I read the letters sent from my sister,

186
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,010
were my only source of support during those days, when I was

187
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,910
busy trying to stay alive.

188
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,960
<i>Hit the target!</i>

189
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,740
<i>Kim Shin has delivered a report of victory from the frontier.</i>

190
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,300
<i>Kim Shin has delivered a report of victory from the border.</i>

191
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,400
<i>General Kim Shin from Liaodong, report of victory...</i>

192
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,210
<i>News of Kim Shin's victory gets spread around the streets intentionally </i>

193
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,190
<i>and the people who are foolish are getting fooled each time. </i>

194
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,050
<i> And that's all there is to a military official's resentment.</i>

195
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,570
<i>Do not tell him he is great. </i>

196
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,950
<i>The dignity of the royal family is kicked to the streets. </i>

197
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,070
<i>I worry about your sister's safety. </i>

198
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,820
<i>Send that message. </i>

199
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,180
<i>He has no talent in archery.</i>

200
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:29,060
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

201
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,850
<i>He's been staring at the same page for an hour.</i>

202
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,730
<i>He must not have a talent for studying, either.</i>

203
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,000
<i>That's not true. There must be things on his mind.</i>

204
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,370
<i>But how could he not even once come to see me?</i>

205
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,380
<i>He's really someone who makes a woman sick.</i>

206
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,720
<i>The King is coming.</i>

207
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,840
<i>You're heavy.</i>

208
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,270
<i>A cold-hearted person was in my mind...</i>

209
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,820
<i>Where are you headed in such a rush?</i>

210
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,140
<i>To see the King.</i>

211
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,410
<i>I was going to go.</i>

212
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:53,240
<i>I thought it would be better if the two of us came together.</i>

213
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,280
<i>When you behold a lowly thing in your grasp</i>

214
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,620
<i>you must use power moderately.</i>

215
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,850
<i>If you hold on tightly to something precious</i>

216
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,390
<i>that precious thing</i>

217
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,440
<i>will die without fail.</i>

218
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,760
<i>In your hand.</i>

219
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,330
<i>No. Never.</i>

220
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,210
<i>In the Queen's presence do not serve any medicine. This is a royal command.</i>

221
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,430
<i>The Queen shall not drink any medicine.</i>

222
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,810
<i>Don't drink anything that is sent to you.</i>

223
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,940
<i>I wonder why he's like that.</i>

224
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,110
<i>It makes Your Highness sad.</i>

225
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,200
<i>Open the door!</i>

226
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,380
<i> General Kim Shin has returned in triumph!</i>

227
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,160
<i>Your brother is victorious once again.</i>

228
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,020
<i>Between the two of us</i>

229
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,710
<i>who do you wish would live?</i>

230
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,190
<i>- Your Highness...<br>- Answer me.</i>

231
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,850
<i>No, have you already made up your mind?</i>

232
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,280
<i>Well...</i>

233
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,330
<i>Whether I live or your brother lives</i>

234
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,050
<i>you have nothing to lose.</i>

235
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,480
<i>You are a fool. </i>

236
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,980
<i>Do you wish to die?</i>

237
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,320
<i>Why are you dressed like that?</i>

238
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,280
<i>In your heart, you are already mourning.</i>

239
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,100
<i>Now I do not know</i>

240
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,390
<i>if those at the border are the enemy or your brother is the enemy.</i>

241
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,150
<i>Park Joong Hun is the enemy.</i>

242
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,210
<i>You have to decide.</i>

243
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,120
<i>To live as my woman or die as a treasonous criminal's</i>

244
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,710
<i>sister.</i>

245
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,040
<i>It was not for a long time,</i>

246
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,550
but I feel as though she had happy moments.

247
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,080
Even in the last moment that she closed her eyes,

248
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,270
she was still looking at that dummy.

249
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,810
Then, what about the king?

250
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,270
Did the king get reincarnated, too?

251
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,020
That... I do not know.

252
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,790
What he looks like...

253
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,940
I want to see his face.

254
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,480
Was he handsome?

255
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,990
If you are my sister

256
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,300
there is one thing that's unchanged.

257
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,170
But...

258
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,370
as though you remember it all,

259
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,580
you talk about it so eagerly and ardently,

260
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,490
as if your life

261
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,320
has been continuing on since that time?

262
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,180
You might not believe it,

263
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,680
but I've been living with those memories intact.

264
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,590
I'm saying this because you know I don't believe it

265
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,880
but it's not that I don't believe in past life,

266
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,030
but I came because of the persimmon, shoes and clothes.

267
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,220
Not being able to give her things of that sort, I wonder if it left a deep regret in you.

268
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,210
And I am sure that you have gone mad, but I feel as though you're reasonably insane.

269
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,260
So I felt a little bad.

270
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,850
Looking at you like this,

271
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,650
it really seems you are Seon.

272
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,560
Just because you are my Orabeoni in my last life

273
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,980
don't start speaking informally to me all of a sudden.

274
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,080
Even between siblings who haven't seen each other in a long time, they would find it awkward.

275
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,150
For someone who says that he is an Orabeoni who crossed lifetimes

276
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,500
how could I welcome you gladly so suddenly?

277
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,640
So... don't feel too bad.

278
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,200
I have troubled you a lot. Then...

279
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,160
He didn't even come to see me off.

280
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,000
When you aren't even going to hold onto me, why are you staring at me?

281
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,790
- Can I... hold onto you? <br> - If you do,

282
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,880
then what happens to us next?

283
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,450
You're really bad...

284
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,340
Is it you?

285
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,220
Or not?

286
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,190
She left well?

287
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,590
That woman...

288
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,590
she always... leaves well...

289
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,160
Are you okay?

290
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,330
I am curious about something.

291
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,160
That portrait, who drew it?

292
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,850
King Yeo did.

293
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,000
Although it's my sister's appearance

294
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,170
it's the way he saw her.

295
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,320
His grudges, crimes,

296
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,250
and longing are encompassed in that painting.

297
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,290
I feel as though that could have been...

298
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,820
his last act...

299
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,010
After he killed her like that?

300
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,970
Yes, after he did all that.

301
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,930
- Part-timer?<br> - Yes, it's me.

302
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,820
I thought you might be here like this.

303
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:14,550
I thought that past life stuff was nothing.

304
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,270
I don't even believe it.

305
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,120
But my whole body aches like I got the flu after I left that house.

306
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,440
If it's too much, let me know. And I will take you to a hospital.

307
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,340
No. To my home.

308
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,960
There isn't anything...

309
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:38,050
but it keeps hurting here. No...

310
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,800
somewhere deeper, it hurts.

311
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,230
A heartless someone...

312
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,300
is walking in my heart,

313
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,210
so it feels like my heart is sinking...

314
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,290
Part-timer?

315
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,900
Yes, it's me. I thought you might be here like this.

316
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:25,450
I thought that past life stuff was nothing. I don't even believe it.

317
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,310
But my whole body aches like I got the flu after I left that house.

318
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,710
If it's too much, let me know, and I will take you to a hospital.

319
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,560
No, to my home.

320
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:44,540
There isn't anything, but it keeps hurting here.

321
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,280
No, somewhere deeper, it hurts.

322
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:56,180
A heartless someone is walking in my heart.

323
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,890
So it feels like my heart's sinking.

324
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,280
Let's go.

325
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,460
It's cold out.

326
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,800
What?

327
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,670
He lives in the rooftop house.

328
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,010
Okay, I see.

329
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,980
Watch out for the stairs.

330
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,130
The woman downstairs was friends with the Goblin bride?

331
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,080
The world is really so small.

332
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,580
I saw it in his phone.

333
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,170
What?

334
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,680
The Goblin and his wife.

335
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,490
Is that you and that person who insists he's the older brother?

336
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,090
The Goblin and his wife?

337
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:18,440
You won't tell me, right? Their identities.

338
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,770
I'm sorry.

339
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:29,580
He also won't tell me, right?

340
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,190
His identity.

341
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,830
I'm sorry.

342
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,610
I need to break up, right?

343
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,160
You... are just a person?

344
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,150
Yes.

345
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,410
Alright.

346
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,580
What are you doing?

347
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,390
Meeting you.

348
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,270
Since where?

349
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,050
I walked with you all the steps you walked.

350
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,210
Look how pretty you speak.

351
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,600
My boss's life is seriously...

352
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,660
I was born as Ji Eun Tak in a strange world from the start.

353
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,020
Whether I see ghosts or whether the Goblin shows up,

354
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,750
whether I encounter the Grim Reaper, that stuff isn't strange.

355
00:29:54,750 --> 00:30:00,260
But my boss is suddenly being jammed into a very strange genre.

356
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:07,330
Her so-called older brother from a past life is a goblin and the man she likes is a grim reaper.

357
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,960
While her hired help sees ghosts.

358
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,210
There are times when there are more ghosts than customers at the store.

359
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,780
Past life. But can that really be?

360
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,110
It's just a life that's passed.

361
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,030
At some moment I myself can't remember.

362
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:35,210
Do you think I stuck around briefly in the life of Kim Shin?

363
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,490
Maybe?

364
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,450
I wish my boss was really your younger sister.

365
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,460
My boss is really a very good person.

366
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,750
I think not.

367
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:54,290
I guess siblings quarrel nonstop in their present life or their past life.

368
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,530
I wish I had an older brother like you, too.

369
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,660
Oh! I do have brother. Tae Hee Oppa!

370
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,670
At this rate, later on, you will just...

371
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,740
The two of you will go get some beef at the restaurant in Canada then?

372
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,000
Oh, my regular place.

373
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,450
What regular place after going there twice? I've been going there for 50 years, alright?

374
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,630
I won't go there with anyone else. I'll only go with you.

375
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,810
Yeah, right! But you did!

376
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,250
I did? Really? When?

377
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,380
How do you know?

378
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,000
I shouldn't have come to pick you up.

379
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,460
How do you know it?

380
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,850
Hey, come in. Don't pull out to the back.

381
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,850
One, two, three!

382
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,000
One more.

383
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,890
<i>You look...</i>

384
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,730
<i> Model pose. Model pose.</i>

385
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,380
<i>Only you look good in it.</i>

386
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,270
<i>Only she looks...</i>

387
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,680
Hello?

388
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,830
It's my number.

389
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,410
How did you know my number?

390
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:06,010
When a new school year begins, they give only to the class president something called an emergency contact list.

391
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:10,830
You wouldn't have received it since I was always the president for all three years.

392
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:17,880
Congrats on graduation. Let's keep in touch now and then.

393
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,510
Alright.

394
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,470
Congrats to you, too.

395
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,350
Now, everyone to their seats.

396

<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

397
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,630
You look so grown up in regular clothes. You all worked hard for three years, everyone.

398
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:45,230
I'll pass on your uniforms to the next class years for you, and it'll just be tedious for me to make this long as your homeroom teacher.

399
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,370
So we end here. Congrats to you all for graduating.

400
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,930
Parents outside, come in.

401
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,560
Come and hug them to tell them they worked hard and to congratulate them.

402
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,510
Yes.

403
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,280

Why did you hug me?

416
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:18,070
Because you're adorable. When you came to exist...

[Late Joseon, King Cheol Jong's 12th year in reign]

444

<i>What's wrong, My Lord? Is something bothering you?</i>

445
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,200
<i>It's nothing.</i>

446
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,290
<i>Now after all the stuff, I can even see a life in a faraway time.</i>

447
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:24,900
<i>What life? How far away, My Lord?</i>

448
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:31,120
<i>They clearly speak in Joseon language but they also mix in <br>a lot of American. I wonder if the world is one?</i>

449
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,020
<i>Just when I think I know it, I don't. It's not just that, either.</i>

450
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:43,210
<i>They keep touching some scrap metal about the size of a half an inkstone like it's a new baby that they love and cherish.</i>

451
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,340
<i>I really don't understand what you mean...</i>

452
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:52,850
<i>It's dark but shiny, too. I think it will be in wide use.</i>

453
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,950
<i>Remember it.</i>

454
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,360
<i>It looks like this.</i>

<i>Click.</i>

456
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,190
<i>Click.</i>

457
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:22,250
<i>If you come to invest in it, do it big.</i>

458
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,970
<i>Yes, My Lord.</i>

459
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,020
It's pretty.

460
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:19,280
She just stayed for a bit and left.

461
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,860
In a moment even I didn't know.

462
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,290
What are you doing?

463
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:59,910
Because it's strange. How did I see you since then?

464
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,920
When? In the classroom?

465
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,420
No. Way back.

466
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,480
There was a beautiful occurrence like that.

467
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,060
What specifically?

468
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:20,400
Late Joseon, King Cheol Jong's 12th year in reign, I met her.

469
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,670
Who?

470
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,160
My first love.

471
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,210
This man, seriously. It's D-A-N-C!

472
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:33,260
Where did you learn that language? It's not the Analects of Confucius or Mencius.

473
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,750
It's off the streets. The streets. "Didn't ask, not curious" is what I said!

474
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,860
I am curious. Those flowers, where did you get them?

475
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,900
Perhaps... from that Tae Hee or what...

476
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,700
Tae Hee Oppa didn't come. If he did come, I would have just set him off.

477
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,690
I have someone who gives me flowers and things, too.

478
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,820
Don't just play around

479
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,800
and take some pictures.

480
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,610
If you press this...

481
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,470
I know.

482
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,410
Oh, I'm impressed.

483
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,890
I don't have any graduation photos.

484
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,510
I'm going to keep it forever!

485
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,640
Why must you talk like that when we're just taking one photo? <br>How can anyone take a picture at this rate?

486
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,430
Don't move!

487
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,230
You have to count 1, 2, 3 before you take it.

488
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,990
You can't just take it like that.

489
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,160
Even so, you are pretty.

490
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,650
Our school is very nice, right?

491
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,390
It's nice.

492
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,110
There were a few things I didn't like, too...

493
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,740
Why did you take a picture like that?

494
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:13,210
A little bit closer.

495
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,390
<i>But there were nice things, too.</i>

496
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,400
It seems like nice things come later, just like you.

497
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,170
I came early, but I didn't know the classroom's number.

498
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,080
Not that.

499
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,730
Don't be sad that I came alone.

500
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:40,890
Deok Hwa went to work. And Reaper is not feeling so well now.

501
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,030
They all congratulate you.

502
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,950
Then... who are those two?

503
00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:00,320
They didn't come for your graduation, they came thinking they will meet someone here.

504
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:07,500
Amazing. Then us... Mister, open the door.

505
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:14,440
It looks like you came to congratulate her on her graduation.

506
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,330
That's an excuse. I came to see someone else.

507
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,810
Thankfully, that someone is standing in front of me.

508
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:28,390
I came because I thought I'd be able to come to a decision<br> when I saw your face. But seeing you,

509
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,750
it's just good.

510
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,290
What about the investigation you said before, is it done?

511
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,770
Why aren't you sharing the information? I came to listen to that.

512
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,880
Not yet...

513
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,610
Then, let's just say we will meet once the investigation is done<br> and you would be returning the ring.

514
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,290
This, give it to my part-timer. I bought it to give it to her.

515
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,980
Why give this to me?

516
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,430
That's why I bought it.

517
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:20,780
I wanted to try to give flowers to someone at least once...

518
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,230
Who are you, Kim Woo Bin?

519
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:37,990
Although you might not believe me, but I don't know..

520
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,560
who I am.

521
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:49,210
I guess people in your household usually say unbelievable things and are unbelievable beings.

522
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:51,800
This relationship really has no answer.

523
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,780
I had hoped it wouldn't be like this but the conclusion keeps being tragic.

524
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:16,450
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

525
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,080
It's a present.

526
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,990
Since you graduated and became an adult, it's something that you might need.

527
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,920
I cannot use it yet.

528
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,810
Legally, I need my aunt's approval.

529
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:47,280
So we got the legal approval. This is now yours.

530
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,790
Really? How?

531
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,350
Thank you.

532
00:45:55,350 --> 00:46:01,190
It's not from me, but from your mother. I am just a messenger.

533
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,470
Still, thank you.

534
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:08,080
What do I do? I don't think I'll be able to use any of it.

535
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,820
Since my mom gave this to me, I don't think I'll be able to spend any of it.

536
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,220
Use it when you need it. I am sure this is what she wants.

537
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,660
Living in this world without a mother,

538
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:24,420
she saved it thinking about her nine-year-old daughter.

539
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:32,500
But, what happened to my aunt? Is she doing well?

540
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,940
It's so cold!

541
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,680
Oh, my face is so dry from using crappy lotion.

542
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,700
Why couldn't I remember Ji Eun Tak's name? Where can I go to find her?

543
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,420
We won't be able to find her. She must have graduated by now.

544
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,420
She must have gotten into college. We can probably locate her <br>if we look through the college directories here in Seoul.

545
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,540
She was good in school.

546
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,160
College! After eating rice with beans (in jail), your head is working properly now!

547
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,820
You're just a rice with beans type, aren't you?

548
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,550
You better eat it often. Let's go.

549
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,960
It's a worry. She couldn't have spent it all, right?

550
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,460
Hey, a wench who has spent money before is good at spending<br> it. She could never spend that money because of her mom.

551
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,120
We just need to find her.

552
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,930
Mom, I'm hungry. Let's eat something.

553
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,800
- Do you want to drink beer?<br>- I should sleep.

554
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,690
Looking at your expression, the result must not have been good. We even gave you space.

555
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,920
I am me, and you are you.

556
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,300
What are you talking about?

557
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,200
A name card arrived.

558
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,870
Chairman Yoo's?

559
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,360
No.

560
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,070
Miscellaneously Omitted.

561
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,670
Two weeks from now, it's death by falling. Even though you might not see it.

562
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,090
Thank you for letting me know.

563
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:07,560
Is that all? Aren't you going to get angry? Aren't you going to curse God?

564
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:13,020
This is going to keep happening. I can't get surprised every time it does.

565
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,340
That's true, too.

566
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:20,160
<i>So you should get the sword pulled out and go back to nothingness. Be at peace.</i>

567
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,220
<i>If not, death will constantly haunt that child.</i>

568
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:28,000
<i>Will you be able to stop it every time?</i>

569
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,110
Will I be able to stop it?

570
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:33,130
<i>In the end, there will be a time when you can't stop it. </i>

571
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:37,380
<i>Then Eun Tak will lose her life and you will lose your chance <br>of going back to nothingness.</i>

572
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:45,520
<i>You will need to live on for another thousand years <br>or be in that hell of immortality. It's a foolish decision.</i>

573
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,510
<i>So get the sword pulled out and go back to nothingness.</i>

574
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,900
<i>It might be sad but that is for the best.</i>

575
00:48:52,900 --> 00:49:00,830
I'm trying not to do the best... but I'm a bit sad.

576
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,660
Is there something wrong?

577
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,890
What's this?

578
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,820
- A name card.

579
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,770
Whose? Yours?

580
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:20,830
No. Yours.

581
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,670
Mine?

582
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:34,360
Am I dying?

583
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:41,100
Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you. I hid something from you.

584
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,350
I said that I won't hide anything from you, but I still did it.

585
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:52,220
But... I cannot do it anymore so I will tell you everything.

586
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:59,360
If you don't remove my sword ,you will die. That's been your destiny

587
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,450
since the moment you were born as the Goblin's Bride.

588
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:11,570
If you don't remove the sword, death won't stop looking for you.

589
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,330
Just like now.

590
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,530
So..

591
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:28,330
if I don't remove your sword, until I ultimately die,

592
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,360
death will come looking for me continuously?

593
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:37,390
All this time, those accidents...

594
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:39,080
Yeah.

595
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,880
When you were kidnapped,

596
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,330
<i>You startled me!</i>

597
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:48,020
<i>... and at the ski resort,</i>

598
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,680
there were a few more accidents you don't know about,

599
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:59,440
and also... when I almost killed you.

600
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,440
God...

601
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,640
even to you and to me,

602
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,690
he is so harsh.

603
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:36,890
This darn fate...

604
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,510
Mister, I'll just die.

605
00:51:54,740 --> 00:52:00,940
You can continue to live so I will be reincarnated and meet you.

606
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,280
You must stay here.

607
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:12,100
I will come to find you. I promise.

608
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:21,220
Should I?

609
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:24,880
Mister, let's just pull the sword out.

610
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,380
If I die, then you would have to live forever. A bride probably won't appear.

611
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:35,390
Then, I should just pull out the sword. That would be better, right?

612
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,860
Should we?

613
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:48,820
Mister, let's just die together. That would be better. The same day, the same hour.

614
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,020
Without leaving someone behind, without hurting someone.

615
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,480
Ji Eun Tak, look at me.

616
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:12,130
You won't die. I will make it so that you won't die. I will stop it.

617
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:14,500
I will stop it all.

618
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:26,510
I'm sorry. For getting you entangled in this fate.

619
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,350
But we must pass this to go on.

620
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:34,410
I don't know what door will open,

621
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:40,200
but I will not let your hand go. I promise.

622
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,830
So believe in me.

623
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:47,700
I might be a bigger person than what you thought.

But, I can't live while just being locked here in the house.

It was so hard for my mom to give birth to me. I tried so hard<br> to get into college. I have so many reasons to live.

♬ <i> I miss you, miss you </i> ♬

689
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:54,590

♬ <i> My fateful love </i> ♬

691
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:03,420
I am...

692
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:08,890
a grim reaper.

693
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:10,860
What did you say?

694
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,340
♬ <i> Again, our </i> ♬

695
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:19,540

697
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,030

<i>♬ <i> Please don't leave </i> ♬</i>

699
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,160
...it's a tragedy.

700
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,800
Should we just...

701
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:46,330
break up?

702
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:24,880
<i>I finished OT earlier and I just finished registering for classes. </i>

703
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,810
<i>And now I'm touring the campus. </i>

704
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:30,100
Say "I miss you" with a sad emoji. Put a heart.

705
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:35,340
"I love you. ♥ ♥." Do it. So romantic!

706
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:40,890
I had my time, too. My warm day of spring. But now I'm stuck <br>roaming around this nether world with a deep grudge

707
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:44,070
and every day is a cold winter night for me.

708
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:49,280
It'd be so good if you could meet that punk for me once. It'd be <br>so good if you could just ask him once what I'm curious about.

709
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,520
Curious about? What?

710
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,940
"Did you actually love me?" Something like that?

711
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,090
So romantic.

712
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,850
Fine. Let's put an end to that winter night.

713
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:04,840
Let's go take revenge. How do you want me to take care of that jerk?

714
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,740
- You're going to set fire? <br>- Better to be safe than sorry.

715
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:34,310
- What is it? <br>- I'm here

716
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:38,650
to tell you something on behalf of your deceased wife,

717
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:41,220
Miss Lee Jeong Hwa.

718
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,720
Do you have time?

719
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:56,370
How do you know my wife...

720
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:59,120
I'll just tell you what I'm here for simply.

721
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:03,520
Miss Lee Jeong Hwa asked me to tell you something.

722
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,110
Yes, go ahead.

723
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,290
Have you been well?

724
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:15,960
You and Hee Jin look good together.

725
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,780
She's saying that.

726
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:22,710
- Who is? <br>- Your wife is.

727
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:28,050
How do you know Hee Jin...

728
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:31,440
- You brought her home. <br>- You brought her home.

729
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,780
- The day you guys had your 200th day anniversary. <br>- The day you guys had your 200th day anniversary.

730
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:37,780
- You bought her a pretty bag, I saw. <br>- You bought her a pretty bag, I saw.

731
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:43,380
- With money from my insurance. <br>- With money from my insurance.

732
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:47,210
What, really? Jeez this is where I get pissed off.

733
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,740
So that's why that day, on the roof top...

734
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,970
So that's why that day, on the roof top...

735
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:55,630
- you pushed me? <br>- you pushed--

736
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,290
[Ji Eun Tak, age 20]

737
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:15,930
What did you just ask me to do?

738
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:18,750
This kind of twist is not okay.

739
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:20,780
What are you?

740
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,320
You and Hee Jin conspired the crime together over the phone.

741
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:26,560
I recorded it all and hid it in the shoe cabinet by the front door.

742
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:31,930
I mean, if you hid the evidence of him and Hee Jin conspiring the crime,

743
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:36,440
you should be taking that to the police station to resolve this. This isn't the way.

744
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,240
You. How did you find out?

745
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,420
Where are you looking towards when you're talking?

746
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:47,750
Yeah, this is supposed to be a sitcom. How come you're turning this into a thriller?

747
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,460
Your husband's so scary.

748
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:55,260
We'll all die if we just do this without a plan like this.

749
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:58,750
- I'm already dead. <br>-...Unni!

750
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:02,030
Look how selfish you are. What about me then?

751
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:05,730
Are you... a crazy bitch?

752
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:08,350
Where the heck are you looking at and talking?

753
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:12,350
Your wife. Your wife that you killed.

754
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:20,800
So you want to die, too, then.

755
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,750
Young bitches are so careless.

756
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,540
Just crawling up the rail like that.

757
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,730
Right?

758
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:54,880
"Death from a fall."

759
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:02,740
I really wasn't going to use the boyfriend card,

760
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:10,550
but I really worry how my boyfriend's going to reprimand you.

761
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,800
I'm sorry.

762
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:57,920
Go and get the human punishment.

763
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,930
If you take my punishment, you'll die.

764
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:08,190
I killed someone. I killed my wife.

765
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:22,860
I'm sorry. I just really wanted to say it.

766
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:26,970
That it's not fair. That it hurts.

767
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:32,000
"Save me. Help me." Those things I didn't get to say then.

768
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,480
I wanted to say them all.

769
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:38,220
- She said sorry. <br>- Seriously, you're...

770
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,720
You almost died just now.

771
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,800
I know. I'm sorry.

772
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:54,540
You hurry and go somewhere nice. I need to be reprimanded, it seems.

773
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:56,850
Thank you for helping me.

774
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,290
Thank you for hearing me out.

775
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:02,770
Be well, Eun Tak.

776
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,930
You're still mad?

777
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:24,460
I'm sure you'd be mad. You should be mad.

778
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:34,060
I'm not mad. I was only worried.

779
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:38,300
But why do I feel like I'm getting scolded.

780
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,480
My heart feels like its stinging.

781
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,070
Not as bad as mine.

782
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:46,220
I don't know how many times I went to hell and came back within one hour.

783
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,800
Seriously.

784
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,870
We are so pitiful.

785
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:53,770
No.

786
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:55,800
Really.

787
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,200
Are we unfortunate then?

788
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,150
No.

789
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:02,770
Then...

790
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:06,120
Mister, about you scolding me...

791
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,140
is it done, then?

792
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,120
No.

793
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:16,490
When I'm a college student, I'm going to go on<br> lots of meeting dates and wear only super short skirts.

794
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:18,840
No!

795
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,930
Your face is looking too thin these days.

796
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,660
Are you working out by any chance?

797
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,490
Are you having fun?

798
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:37,630
Because you look so depressed, I wanted to say something to make you laugh.

799
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:41,340
It's not funny. Why did you want to see me?

800
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:45,540
Well, you've got two Miscellaneously Omitted persons on your caseload, right?

801
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:49,300
But only one came up. You're supposed to turn in a letter of explanation.

802
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,150
Sunbaenim, you don't check your mail.

803
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:56,770
- I should know something in order to process it.<br>- What do you mean?

804
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:01,970
Has it been about 20 years? I made eye contact with some deceased person.

805
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:03,950
But that deceased had no information about him.

806
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:06,030
What kind of a deceased person?

807
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:11,090
It seems like he's been wandering in this life for so long.

808
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:15,880
With no fear at all. It was my first time seeing a deceased person who wasn't afraid of a grim reaper.

809
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,700
It was fascinating. Of course, I lost him.

810
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,290
I got nothing but blame when I reported it.

811
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:26,250
The other remaining document is for that deceased.

812
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:32,600
A new face. The one I mentioned before who's got a lot of info and has been living in the nether world for a long time.

813
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,140
Ahhh, that.

814
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,940
20 years ago

815
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,880
he even ran away from a grim reaper.

816
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,800
Really? I also had the same experience when I was nine...

817
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:49,530
Nice to meet you.

818
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:54,590
So you are that Goblin's bride.
