2
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,340
Why? Are you in pain?

3
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,000
By any chance, is it because of the sword?

4
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,440
Mister...

5
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,910
I can grab the sword.

6
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,140
Wait a minute.

7
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,090
Wait a minute, I'll pull it out for you.

8
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,390
It is moving.

<i>The oracle was true.</i>

10
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,910
<i>The future I envisioned was true.</i>

11
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:08,910
<i>Through this child, I will be able to end this immortal existence</i>

12

14
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:34,090
<i>is that just a life of an immortal? Or is it your face?</i>

15
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,380
<i>Ah.</i>

16
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,370
<i>I think it's your face.</i>

17
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,010
<i>- Episode 8 -</i>

18
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,730
Mister, are you okay?

19
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,820
I think I should be the one asking that.

20
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,070
Is that right?

21
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,460
Oh, what an ordeal.

22
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,800
I'm sorry. You were startled a lot, right?

23
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,420
Mister didn't know that it would hurt like this,

24
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,610
since no one has ever grabbed it before.

25
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,040
By the way, you can really fly.

26
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,450
I wasn't asking you to show me this way.

27
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,560
That's a piece of gum. (cake, homonym for sword)

28
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,050
We should toughen up our hearts.

29
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,570
I see now that this is not something to be taken lightly.

30
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,260
But to be honest, I was more surprised that I could move the sword.

31
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,770
Aren't you really relieved?

32
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,570
With that, it has been proven that I am really the Goblin's bride, right?

33
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,290
I'm glad.

34
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,260
Are you not glad?

35
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,060
I'm glad.

36
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,620
See... I am really the bride.

37
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,880
This was fate.

38
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,880
Fate.

39
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,100
It's cool.

40
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,850
Why is this Uncle not home yet? I can't get my allowance until I fulfill my task.

41
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,160
Let's see what commotion there was today.

42
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,810
It is him.

43
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,460
Uncle, you were on the second floor? I was waiting all this time.

44
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,300
Uncle, hurry up and look at this.

45
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,350
By any chance, was this you, Uncle?

46
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,320
So how can you sit around like this? Take care of it.

47
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,160
- Was this really you? <br>- I don't have any energy to explain, so don't ask.

48
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,650
We don't have any time. Hurry.

49
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,500
What on earth did you do?

50
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,170
Grandfather, listen to what I'm going to say now, carefully.

51
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,930
Uncle... no, not me. Uncle!

52
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,080
Mr. Kim, listen to what I'm going to say now, carefully.

53
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,070
From this very moment, by gathering up the entire secretary's office at Cheon Woo Group--

54
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,110
No, not me.

55
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,060
It's not about me!

56
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,200
Uncle down the hall, we have to go somewhere.

57
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,520
Where?

58
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,160
Since Uncle lacks social skills, he shattered society.

59
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,060
From this moment, you are to request all the sites

60
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,550
which have links to the video remove them immediately.

61
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,160
Before it spreads, you are to block it quickly and precisely. <br>You may utilize big data and if you do make contact

62
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,730
with the person in charge, it might be easier and more effective if you tell them that Cheon Woo Group will remove all its sponsoring ads.

63
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,420
Now... let's start.

64
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,630
Yes.

65
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,190
Now, everyone.

66
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,090
Okay, firstly, those whose car or property got damaged, please stand here.

67
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,970
Those who saw something disturbing and got mentally disturbed,

68
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,970
please line up over there.

69
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,170
The car was mangled due to a sudden gust of wind. That's all.

70
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,340
The money was just luck that fell out of the sky. That is it.

71
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,960
Also, you did not see me today.

72
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,110
Okay, next.

73
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,520
I'm next. By the way, isn't it really dark out here?

74
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,420
I wasn't feeling too good.

75
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,060
Could you please look into my eyes for a moment?

76
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,900
The car was mangled due to a sudden gust of wind.

77
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,700
The money fell down from the sky, that is it. Today you did not see me.

78
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,190
Okay... Next, next!

79
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,430
Yes, hurry, come this way.

80
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,860
Eyes, look at my eyes. Look.

81
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,510
Yes, next person.

82
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,850
What's your car type?

83
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,470
It'll be done here once we delete these files.

84
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,530
Can you look into my eyes for a moment?

85
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,060
I mean, what kind of couple fights like that to demolish 30 cars?

86
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,070
Do you know how much Uncle down the hall and I went through?

87
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,420
You did a good job. Thanks.

88
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,990
Don't be thankful. I just don't have the energy to fight, that's all.

89
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,200
Let's postpone this fight. It's disturbing enough as it is.

90
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,710
No matter how disturbed you are, it's worse for me.

91
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,190
How do you know whether it's not as bad or worse for me?

92
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,240
Hey, for me, this thing... this much, like this...

93
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,150
Never mind. Forget it.

94
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,070
Did you come back from nearly dying or something?

95
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,840
What's wrong with you guys, again?

96
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,340
Buckwheat, we don't have to leave anymore.

97
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,020
I'm the real bride. Surely!

98
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,270
Oh, it hurts.

99
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,670
Mister, what's wrong?

100
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,140
Surely, he's not dead, is he?

101
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,200
It's because of the medicine. Let him sleep.

102
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,770
If he sleeps like that, he won't get full rest.

103
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,370
You should carry him like this to the room.

104
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,500
Yes, do that. If you can do it, that is.

105
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,810
What's wrong? Why did you take the medicine?

106
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,700
Does it still hurt?

He doesn't have a fever...

123
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,310
This grown-up adult passes out and sleeps anywhere.

124
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,730
Because it hurts.

125
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,140
You're awake?

126
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,400
It smells like a pain relief patch.

127
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,380
I was hurting here and there. Are you hurting a lot, too?

128
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,050
You said you were fine earlier.

129
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,130
It was a lie.

130
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,700
You're always lying.

131
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,170
Get well soon.

132
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,560
You don't even know where it hurts.

133
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,590
Where does it hurt?

134
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,060
First love hurts a lot.

135
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,060
She must've been really pretty.

136
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,110
I saw you wrote stuff down about it, too.

137
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,570
A lot. Every day...

138
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,990
She's pretty.

139
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,860
You're not feeling well at all. You're gravely ill.

140
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,680
Sleep a lot. So you can get well soon.

141
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,320
Don't do that.

142
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,220
Why? Why should I be nice to someone who only thinks about his first love?

143
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,190
Is that something to say to your bride?

144
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,030
If you look closely, you can see the pretty parts.

145
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,610
So don't leave.

146
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,620
Did I or did I not tell you not to say words that begin with "ch?"

147
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,960
You're so petty.

Fine. The item?

152
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,260
Can you actually interpret this?

153
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,310
It is a must for a third generation Chaebol to finish studying the Thousand-Character Classic at the age of three--

154
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,550
- But what is this?<br>- Your Uncle's background information.

155
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,180
Especially about his first love. It's our secret.

156
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,030
This little girl... I enjoy digging up background information.

157
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,330
This is letter means "to hear," in case you don't know it.

158
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,350
You can't not know what this means after eating up all the sandwich.

159
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,360
- It's not allowed. <br> - It's a love letter.

160
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,160
- A love letter? <br> - Yeah.

161
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,200
It's a sad love confession.

162
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,970
"After living for one hundred days, one day,

163
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,830
on an ordinary day..."

164
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,590
I had my suspicions. I guess it's just as I thought. It's fine, I know who it is.

165
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,130
- Who is it?<br>- I heard all about it.

166
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,260
Well, that can happen. There can be one woman you can't ever forget after 900 years.

167
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,270
- He said there's just one person?<br>- It's not?

168
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,220
- I wouldn't know about that.<br>- Oh, I got scared.

169
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,000
Anyway. About Kim Shin--

170
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,060
Who's Kim Shin?

171
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,760
- Your uncle. <br>- My uncle's name is Kim Shin?

172
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,230
Our uncle's name is Yoo Shin Jae.

173
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,250
Well, it's a long story.

174
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,070
Anyway, about the sword in your uncle's chest.

175
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,190
Our uncle has a sword in his chest?

176
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,700
- Ah, what do you know about him?<br>- What's the sword about?

177
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,450
If you only tell me a little here and there, I'll get a gum-plex. <br> (play on complex, gum=sword)

178
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,590
If you keep doing this, I won't tell you something that only I know of.

179
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,090
What is something that only you know of?

180
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,620
You said he cried after looking at this painting?

181
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,200
Yeah. He was completely bawling.

182
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,620
I kept telling him he couldn't, but Uncle down the hall

183
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,420
- kept asking to see-- <br>- He cried? Why?

184
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,460
I don't know. Go tell him off, Uncle. Let's get angry at him.

185
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,610
Hurry. Huh? Huh? Huh?

186
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,200
Why did you look at my painting? He said he tried to stop you.

187
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,690
He said you cried. Why would you cry when I don't even cry?

188
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,330
I was flustered, too, so I thought about it a lot.

189
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,230
Stendhal's syndrome. (strong reaction to art or something personally significant) I'm thinking maybe it's something like that.

190
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,560
It was really touching, and I felt really overwhelmed.

191
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,170
But who is it? The girl in the painting?

192
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,300
What are you going to do with that information?

193
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,440
It seemed like I saw her before.

194
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:28,930
Who's the girl that you saw? The girl that I know is my sister.

195
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,960
- You had a older sister, Uncle?<br>- Have you really seen my younger sister?

196
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,090
Think about it carefully, where you saw her.

197
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,300
Ah, younger sister.

198
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,750
I think it's one of the deceased I was in charge of, but I'm not sure about that, either.

199
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,780
This girl reincarnated? When?

200
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:51,760
I told you I'm not sure. Do you know how many people I've taken?<br> How could I remember all their faces?

201
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,930
It just seemed like I saw her before, so I am making that assumption.

202
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,430
I don't have memories, only feelings exist.

203
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,540
It was just really sad.

204
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,870
My heart ached.

205
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,590
Uncles, I got it. I think I know.

206
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,710
What if Uncle down the hall is a reincarnation of your younger sister? Uncle down the hall, try calling him Orabeoni (older brother) once.

207
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,790
- I'll kill you.<br>- I'll kill you.

208
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,810
Oh--

209
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,460
Orabeo--

210
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,390
Senior, have you heard?

211
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,890
About Kim Cha Sae from Jangamdong?

212
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,900
What about Kim Cha Sae from Jangamdong?

213
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,520
He went to get the deceased, but it turned out to be his wife in his former life.

214
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,470
So he classified her as a miscellaneously omitted and they ran off together.

215
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,960
- And then what?<br>- That's all.

216
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,720
I don't know what happened after that. They probably got caught though.

217
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,150
How did he remember his past life?

218
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:14,270
I don't know. That's why everyone is uneasy these days. I drink every day these days, too.

219
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:19,990
You only end up being filled with thoughts.They say if you commit a huge crime in your past life, you become a grim reaper.

220
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:26,120
What wrongdoing did I commit in my previous life, and how bad would it have been? Could it be that my memory was wiped so that I wouldn't be agonized by it?

221
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,030
That should I repent my past wrongdoing by doing this kind of work?

222
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,430
It must be a consideration on the part of God.

223
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,800
If you remember, you do. If you don't, you don't.

224
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,990
It should all be God's intention. However, to give back someone's lost memories,

225
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,920
I'm curious to what God's intention is.

226
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,310
In many ways...

227
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,230
Joon Yeong!

228
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,740
Mom!

229
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,790
Was it fun?

230
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,860
What shall we eat?

231
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,740
I'm leaving.

232
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,800
Drink alcohol in moderation.

233
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,730
Work hard.

234
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,420
Mom, where is this place?

235
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,660
I think it's a tea place.

236
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,450
Ah. What are we going to drink? What are you going to order, Mom?

237
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,810
Mom ordered Heaven,

238
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,000
to give to Joon Yeong.

239
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,340
Heaven?

240
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,470
The Heaven that you have ordered has come out.

241
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,630
Thank you.

242
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,050
Mom, why are you crying?

243
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,580
- What are you doing? <br> - You surprised me!

244
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,440
What are you doing here right now?

245
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,290
I was on my way to the library.

246
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,010
How about you? Do you know this house?

247
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,920
Who are you?

248
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,170
Stay out of my way for a sec.

249
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:09,290
Open the window, let some fresh air in, and button up your shirt.

250
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,580
You'll need this.

251
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,130
Let's go.

252
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,400
Daddy!

253
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,830
How did you get here?

254
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,140
I called a taxi and showed the address to the driver.

255
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,990
It cost $5.20.

256
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,600
<i>I want to go to this place.</i>

257
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,680
<i>I know where it is! Wear your safety belt.</i>

258
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,710
- Daddy, I'm hungry. <br> - Huh?

259
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,570
Here you go.

260
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,860
Daddy, I missed you.

261
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,570
Me, too.

262
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,540
Today, too... you were a little cool.

263
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,090
Sometimes the parents, the children, or the siblings

264
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,420
become the guardian gods for each other.

265
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,830
I merely gave him the sandwich.

266
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:37,520
It was his daughter who saved him, not me.

267
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,070
That's cool as well.

268
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,120
The price of a sandwich is no joke.

269
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,990
It's a good thing that President Yoo earns good money.

270
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,300
By the way, about the sword,

271
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,660
why did it suddenly move?

272
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,920
When I wasn't even able to grab it before? Right?

273
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,190
<i> Shouldn't there be something more powerful than the sign on the back? </i>

274
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,960
<i> For example, real love? </i>

275
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,580
Hey, don't you have anything to tell me?

276
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,590
- No, I don't. <br> - I'm sure you do.

277
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,890
- Ohh, that? There is one thing. <br> - See?

278
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:23,170
You do have something to say. Don't hold back and say it. It's so apparent, so tell me. It's okay.

279
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,520
Whatever you say, you know that I'm the kind of person who will accept it without judgement.

280
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:38,350
I know that you're rich,

281
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,460
but are you alright with just being at home all the time?

282
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,720
That's what you wanted to say?

283
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,850
All you did was serve the country during the Goryeo Dynasty, right?

284
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,030
Hey, are you done with talking? I've had jobs, too!

285
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,470
<i>It won't be eternal,</i>

286
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,480
<i>but it'll keep you from being drunk for a very long time.</i>

287
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,860
<i>It won't be eternal,</i>

288
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,870
<i>but it will be fragrant for a very long time.</i>

289
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:24,010
<i>It won't be eternal, but it will be useful for a very long time.</i>

290
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,960
<i>But why are you speaking informally?</i>

291
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,950
<i>I'm sorry, dear customer.</i>

292
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,620
<i>- Mr. Yoo Jae Shin! <br> - I'm sorry. (said informally) <br> - Hey!</i>

293
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,090
<i>I'm sorry about that, too. (informally)</i>

294
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,670
That's why you've always been home. Because you got nothing. (earn much)

295
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,420
Got nothing? What do you mean?

296
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,610
What do you think it means? It means you're lacking.

297
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:45,230
It's my first time hearing that kind of things being said to me! It's really my first time! Really!

298
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,670
I guess your first love never gave you this constructive criticism. Seeing how you've never heard it before.

299
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,330
Are you jealous right now?

300
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,210
What? Why would I be jealous?

301
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,940
I don't even know if she was from the Goryeo or the Joseon Dynasty.

302
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,500
When did you meet her? During the Goryeo Dynasty?

303
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,100
The Joseon Dynasty? In the beginning of the dynasty? The middle? The end?

304
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,900
She's probably very beautiful in a sophisticated way.

305
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,900
But you see, first love usually never works out.

306
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,540
Go back home. And don't wait for me

307
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,680
since I'll be late.

308
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,350
Who says it doesn't come true?

309
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,710
I don't like it...

310
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,190
Hey, why would you respond to my "Hey" by saying "Ho?" (Ya-Ho=hooray)

311
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:56,200
Don't you find it funny? All of us found it funny.

312
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,860
It's lame.

313
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,450
By the way...

314
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,400
your birthmark has faded a lot.

315
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,490
Really? Could it because I'm getting older?

316
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,660
But why do you keep spending money to buy this for me when I can't even drink it?

317
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,220
It's a waste of money.

318
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,770
Who else would take care of you by getting you coffee?

319
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,550
Did your national exam go well?

320
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Yes, of course.

321
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,600
That's why you should tell me before it's too late.

322
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,360
Other ghosts

323
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,650
are so enthusiastic about asking me to listen to their stories and remove their sorrow.

324
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,220
But why do you not ask me for anything?

325
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:57,480
I won't be able to come here often once I get into college.

326
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,380
Then, can you come here just once to see me?

327
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,300
With some pretty flowers?

328
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,570
I'm in Paju.

329
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,210
Yes, I'll come.

330
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,910
But... how did you die?

331
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,140
While on my way to the graduation ceremony

332
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,070
in a car accident...

333
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,200
Anyway, I'll be waiting for you!

334
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,100
I wonder what her story is.

335
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,570
Welcome!

336
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,160
How do you keep finding out where I am?

337
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,300
It was me who was more surprised. Why did it have to be here of all places?

338
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,280
I heard that the number of chicken restaurants in Korea is greater than the number of McDonalds in the entire world,

339
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,340
so why does it have to be <i>this</i> place?

340
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,070
Because it's the chicken restaurant that Mister Goblin found for me.

341
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,210
As always, he's never helpful to my life.

342
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,810
What is it now?

343
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:17,040
Why do you keep showing up randomly like this and making my heart drop?

344
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,810
Why do you think I came to a chicken restaurant? It's to buy some chicken. Get me some chicken.

345
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:23,450
Stop talking nonsense. I know that you're vegetarian.

346
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,770
Even though you know that, give me some chicken.

347
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,250
That one! With lots of radishes.

348
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,510
Seriously?

349
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,790
Is this a meeting that had been pre-arranged?

350
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,350
The scene of that pre-arranged meeting,

351
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,520
did I come upon it? Very coincidentally?

352
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,240
Hey, what are you doing? You're not allowed to touch this hat so carelessly!

353
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,930
You're not supposed to be seen by people so carelessly, either!

354
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,880
Go there and remain silent in that corner.

355
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,880
Then, I can give you an extra drumstick.

356
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,600
Welcome!

357
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,630
Have you been well?

358
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,030
Sit wherever you'd like.

359
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,170
Please sit down. What would you like to eat?

360
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,920
I've been thinking that we could have some chicken for dinner today?

361
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:25,940
Don't you feel like you want to have chicken for dinner for some reason?

362
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:32,090
There is no other way but to have chicken for today's dinner.

363
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,250
I'm sorry for being egoistic,

364
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,620
- but today's dinner should be chic-- <br>- Shut up. ("shut" sounds like chicken)

365
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,990
Mr. Reaper, come see me for a sec.

366
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,730
Go ahead and eat first. I'll be back before the crusts cool down.

367
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,840
Oh, I'll just go back to noth--

368
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,320
Why do you keep coming to my restaurant?

369
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,790
It couldn't be because of me.

370
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,470
By any chance, is it because of my boss?

371
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:06,270
It's nothing like that. Only, I'm just going there to see her.

372
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,470
As long as you don't reveal my identity,

373
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,070
I think everyone can be at peace.

374
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,660
Just worry about yourself not saying anything.

375
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,680
The fact that Tae Hee oppa came to my part-time work and smiled brightly at me

376
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,320
and that he took two orders when he left is a secret between us.

377
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,370
Secret?

378
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,910
He came to see you at your part-time work? And he smiled brightly at you?

379
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,470
Let's say that smiling brightly at you is something that should be kept secret.

380
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,690
But why is getting takeout a secret? <br>Be honest. How many coupons did you give him?

381
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,160
Hey, you be quiet. How many times did that punk come by?

382
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,290
Let's say that he came by five times. Then how many coupons should he ideally get?

383
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,630
I told you to be quiet!

384
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,810
Hey, do you know thanks to whom he's such a great baseball player?

385
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,510
It's all thanks to me who used to be his guardian god a long time ago.

386
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,090
You don't know anything and what... ?

387
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,020
Let's say that's true. But do you really think you should take all the credit for his success?

388
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,580
It's all due to my first love's strong persistence. Don't you know about human persistence?

389
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,070
Look at me! I eventually managed to grab your sword!

390
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,940
- Let's see if I let you become pretty or not. <br> - Hey, hey!

391
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,290
Tell me how the untimely death system works.

392
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,030
I'll try to figure it out somehow if you just tell me the basic principles.

393
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,540
And I'll resolve the chicken coupon problem for you.

394
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,430
- Why would I ask for your help when I know a faster way to resolve it? Eun Tak! <br> - Hey.

395
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,940
- Ji Eun Tak! <br>- Wow!

396
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,570
<i>I'm telling you, someone put back the piano without being noticed!</i>

397
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,190
<i>How could someone put back something so large and not even be noticed by any of the neighbors? </i>

398
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,750
<i>It's like a ghost did it. It's so weird.</i>

399
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,650
<i>Hey, Ji Eun Tak.</i>

400
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,690
You have a second, right? There's something I'm curious about.

401
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,100
Did you do well on your national exam?

402
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,040
You could say that... Why?

403
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,300
I guess you did really well on it. That's annoying.

404
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,190
You must have done well, too, since you're smart.

405
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,570
But you don't even take extra lessons outside of school. That's cool of you.

406
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,420
- Are you being sarcastic? <br> - I'm actually being sincere.

407
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,800
Which universities did you apply to as early admission? In case we overlap.

408
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,520
Even if it's to the same universities, we wouldn't overlap since I'm a social consideration candidate.

409
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:19,780
So... are you getting accepted?

410
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,180
What are you talking about?

411
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,860
I heard you can see ghosts. Don't ghosts tell you things like that?

412
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,530
I'm also curious as to whether I'm going to be accepted or not.

413
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,010
So that's what you were curious about.

414
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,770
But I like that you're direct instead of talking behind my back.

415
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,370
I can't help suppressing my curiosity by nature.

416
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,240
That must be why you are good at studying.

417
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,560
I just see them, they don't tell me anything.

418
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,220
I'll be going now.

419
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,810
For three years we were in the same class.

420
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,820
We had a three years worth of conversation all in one day.

421
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,520
You have your interview for Seoun University tomorrow, don't you?

422
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,330
Good luck with it.

423
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,590
Y-You, too.

424
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:36,840
♬ <i> It's a beautiful life, I will stay by your side </i> ♬

425
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,900
Why did you come here when you didn't even pay any attention to whether I left or not?

426
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,150
♬ <i> It's a beautiful life, I'll stand right behind you </i> ♬

427
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,030
- Are you sure you didn't forget to bring anything? <br>- Like what?

428
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,390
Ohh, my scarf!

429
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:53,130
Because you kept ignoring my greetings, it kept distracting me!

430
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,990
♬ <i> If I'm with you under this sky </i> ♬

431
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:06,430
♬ <i> Just breathing alone makes me happy </i> ♬

432
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,140
- Don't be scared and don't get nervous. <br> ♬ <i> Beautiful life, beautiful day </i> ♬

433
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,840
♬ <i> I live in your memories, beautiful life </i> ♬

434
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,580
- Would you like me to come with you? <br> ♬ <i> Beautiful day </i> ♬

435
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,230
- Am I a kid? <br>♬ <i> Stay by my side</i> ♬

436
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,760
- Why isn't the bus coming? <br> - Are you still mad at me?

437
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,500
- I was going to be, but it got ruined because of the scarf. <br> ♬ <i> Beautiful my love </i> ♬

438
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,760
- So you <i>are</i> jealous. <br>- So what if I am? Are you happy that I'm jealous? <br> ♬ <i> Beautiful my heart </i> ♬

439
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,150
Yes. It made me feel good all day.

440
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,240
Then go home now.

441
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,500
I'll do well on my interview.

442
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,090
Thank you for the scarf!

443
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,030
Be careful, there's someone behind you.

444
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,160
I'm sorry.

445
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,980
I was going to avoid bumping into them.

446
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,430
Your eyes are really big and clear, so everything gets reflected! Really!

447
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,140
Yeah, alright, so get on the bus.

448
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,340
<i>A pickpocket! He's a thief!</i>

449
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,750
Why you? You weren't in that scene...

450
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,680
What did you say?

451
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,290
My mom will kill me this time if I do badly on my interview again.

452
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,380
I wish there was an accident instead.

453
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,090
Hey, don't say things like that. They say be careful what you wish for.

454
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,660
Whether I die by my mom's hands or in an accident,

455
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,360
people all die anyway.

456
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,470
Hah!

457
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,790
Oh, this is so tiring so early in the morning!

458
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,060
Please have some coffee.

459
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:10,730
Hey, it's me who said that was feeling tired. Why do you only give him coffee?

460
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,220
I told him not to get one for you.

461
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,130
- Are you still mad at me?<br>- Who says that I am mad?

462
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,140
Everyone says so, that you're still mad.

463
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,310
As long as you know.

464
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,780
There are people that I don't recognize.

465
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,100
Even those from Hannam area volunteered.

466
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,430
It seems like it is indeed a huge accident.

467
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:34,390
I heard that even the volunteering team each got five sheets. But you have a lot.

468
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:37,030
It's my jurisdiction.

469
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,360
<i>Kim Hyeon Jeong, age 34.</i>

470
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:48,600
<i> Park Su Bin, age 2, accident.</i>

471
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,150
It seems like it's a mom and child.

472
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:55,030
I guess I'll have to prepare a Heaven again.

473
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,860
Pardon?

474
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:18,330
Why don't you close up early and go home?

475
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:21,600
I haven't even started selling yet you want me to close up?

476
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,910
I mean, what are you talking about?

477
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:27,290
It means that I'm going to buy everything you have.

478
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,130
Why are you so impatient?

479
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,390
Do you even know what these are?

480
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:38,640
They're socks. So how about it? Will you agree to it?

481
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,930
This crazy bastard!

482
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,760
You're that bastard from the bus stop the other day, right?

483
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,650
Who are you to keep following me?

484
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,890
Who do you think I might be?

485
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:52,740
The money you stole is only $23, $32,

486
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,350
$10 and three vouchers.

487
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:00,120
Do you how many people could have been dead today because of this?

488
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,240
What are you? A cop?

489
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,570
The owner of this wallet you just pickpocketed from<br> will have to be hospitalized for three weeks.

490
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:14,540
He will go to work without even wearing a cast because he'd be fired if he missed three weeks of work. All because of you.

491
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,730
What the hell are you talking about? Is this wallet yours by any chance?

492
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:24,120
He'll have to use his salary as his hospital fee, and his not wearing a cast will cause him to get a shock later in life. Because of you.

493
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,890
Shut up if you don't want to die.

494
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,240
I'm asking who you are, you bastard.

495
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,840
I don't like letting someone like you live,

496
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,170
but it would be a side-effect of my intervening in the life and <br>death of human beings, so just go on living.

497
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:38,340
Don't think that you've received enough punishment by this encounter.

498
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,180
You're going to be punished again even after your death.

499
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:49,640
However, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. This is my method.

500
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:54,290
It will hurt a bit. Bear it.

501
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:03,710
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

502
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,030
Get ready. Today's task will start soon.

503
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,460
Yes, yes.

504
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:28,000
The bus in question is approaching now.

505
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,460
Oh, it's Mr. Reaper!

506
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,140
Did that girl just see you?

507
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,670
Is she really seeing us right now?

508
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,080
Some of the people confronting their imminent death can be like that.

509
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,610
I feel sorry that she's so young.

510
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,500
Why is she there?

511
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,810
Does anyone have Ji Eun Tak on their list?

512
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:59,430
Who are you talking about?

513
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,710
That's true.

514
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,790
There's an extra person on the bus who's not listed. Wasn't everyone supposed to die?

515
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:10,300
Wait a sec. What happens if one is left out?

516
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,010
I don't think any accident will take place today. We came here for nothing.

517
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:16,790
What? Why?

518
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,250
Oh, the bus is not supposed to just continue going like that!

519
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,670
It shouldn't be moving normally. There's supposed to be an accident happening right now! It's leaving safely!

520
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:35,070
What should we do? Don't we have to cause an accident then?

521
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,130
The bus... just went... without anyone dying.

522
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:44,630
This has never happened during my 300-year-long career of a Reaper.

523
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,150
Seriously. What should we do?

524
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:50,680
It's my first time witnessing the coming to existence of Miscellaneously Omitted people.

525
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,610
This is indeed a miracle!

526
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:57,610
Miracles do happen...

527
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,100
- Wow. <br> - "Wow?"

528
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,060
Do you know how much paperwork this miracle entails?

529
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,780
What should I do with this little thing!

530
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,370
I'm sorry, sir. I was just very amazed.

531
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:11,070
But how did you predict this?

532
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,400
What a scare!

533
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,470
I-I think it's a Goblin.

534
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,130
Why? Do I look like one?

535
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,170
Let's have a conversation.

536
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,040
- Why didn't you tell me? <br>- Why do you keep on interfering with human lives?

537
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,460
Ji Eun Tak nearly died today.

538
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,720
If that's that child's fate, it cannot be avoided.

539
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,570
Says who?

540
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,830
The only thing I cannot grant is my own death.

541
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:45,620
Do you want to see me interfere with every human life for that child?

542
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,770
You! In someone else's workplace...

543
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:55,190
But... the accident was strange, regardless of how I think about it.

544
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,250
A few days ago, I already saw the accident.

545
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:02,490
But Eun Tak wasn't there. I also saw that child's future ten years from now.

546
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,700
But this was an accident that would have definitely killed her.

547
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,840
It is because that accident that you saw wasn't part of her fate.

548
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,220
She only got into that accident as a variable.

549
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,350
Because you were going to save her.

550
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,260
Oh, thanks to the Miscellaneously Omitted person whose boyfriend is a goblin,

551
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,800
all those who were supposed to die ended up living.

552
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,560
You made me have to work overtime.

553
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,200
Would you like to eat some chicken for a midnight snack?

554
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,420
Have you really not had any thoughts of turning into ashes?

555
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,680
It was a joke. Don't take it that seriously.

556
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,120
I'm wondering what exactly it means to turn into ashes...

557
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,130
Is it like dispersing as dust, wind, or rain?

558
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,620
To somewhere in the world?

559
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,310
Why do you even wonder? The Miscellaneously Omitted can't even grab the sword.

560
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:57,570
Eun Tak... grabbed the sword.

561
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:00,690
The sword even moved, so I...

562
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,970
I almost killed that child.

563
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,480
It hurt so much.

564
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,510
It was the first time I felt that kind of pain.

565
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:18,190
Don't you think you should tell her the truth now?

566
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,600
About what will happen when the sword is taken out?

567
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,220
No.

568
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:27,790
If possible I want to hide it, for about 80 more years.

569
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,780
- Why?<br>- That's a human lifespan exactly.

570
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:38,440
That is the maximum years a 19-year-old can live to be.

571
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,410
I want to do that.

572
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,570
But will that happen?

573
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,180
Will it not be possible?

[Seoun University Admission Ticket]

575
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,740
Did you come to pick me up? I'm surprised!

576
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,860
What I ate for lunch hasn't been digested yet. That's why I came out.

577
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:30,190
I know. There's no way that you would come out just so that I would be comfortable.

578
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:36,190
Huh? What is all this?

579
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:39,960
Why socks?

580
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,900
The 20s and 30s of someone who I managed to save today.

581
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,670
Oh...

582
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,240
In order to save my 20s and 30s,

583
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,030
did you decide to start selling socks from today on?

584
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:55,850
Because I asked you why you were jobless?

585
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,230
- Do you want to do it with me? <br> - Alright.

586
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:06,220
Since all my interviews have ended, I have time now. So I'll take care of Mister better.

587
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,790
In what ways are you going to take care of me?

588
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,290
What are you doing?

589
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:23,790
I'm strengthening my arm. I'm going to make sure I pull it out in one go next time without hurting you.

590
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:28,690
I realized last time that arm strength is important.

591
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:34,260
Take it easy.

592
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:39,230
What is this? A cheer that's making me feel deflated?

593
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:50,590
Would you mind giving us some privacy?

594
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:56,300
- With whom? <br> - I just need a second. Go in your room.

595
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,040
Come here, huh?

596
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,830
Come down here for a sec. Don't you think that I've been punished enough?

597
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,770
Are you that against my receiving a tiny present?

598
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:22,320
You showed me that in advance on purpose, right? To prevent me from taking any action.

599
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,560
Do you think I'll make that choice just because of that?

600
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,030
I'm not going to! I'm never going to, even under the threat of death!

601
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:34,630
Come down, will you? Come down, and let's talk face to face!

602
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,230
Hey!

603
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:43,260
Do you think you'll be scared? Just come down! Seriously, this fellow...

604
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,660
Is he still sick... ?

605
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:03,040
I didn't look. Really.

606
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,320
I really don't like it.

607
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:08,700
I, who likes you,

608
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,570
couldn't be this stupid.

609
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,390
What did you... just say to me?

610
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:22,140
- Never mind if you didn't hear it. <br>- I heard everything.

611
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,820
Then I'm glad.

612
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,890
So... that is...

613
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:48,490
He confessed to me earlier... ?

614
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:51,910

Huh?

619
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:47,490
What?

620
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,540
Because you never call me, I didn't even bother to check my phone!

621
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,800
You surprised me!!

622
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,600
I was surprised that you were the first to call me.

623
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,990
And ten times at that which I missed.

624
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:09,560
That's because I thought of something I wanted to tell you when I was working late.

625
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,050
It seems to be a very important thing to say.

626
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,300
Yes, indeed.

627
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,690
About my religion. I have none.

00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:24,900
<i> Why are you so good at speaking? Do you have a religion by any chance?</i>

629
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:30,370
<i> There is something I should have... yet again... Then I'll get in touch with you when I'm prepared.</i>

630
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:34,640
You called me ten times to tell me that?

631
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,530
I thought I should tell you as soon as possible.

632
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:42,430
How cute!

633
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,190
I'm... cute?

634
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:49,920
Didn't you know that? Did no other woman tell you that?

635
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:53,640
I'm not seeing any woman.

636
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,100
That's a good thing! That! Not seeing anyone else!

637
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:00,510
Don't get ready to see other women. Everything's perfect right now.

638
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,260

639
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,260
Is this guy a pro? (with women)

640
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,730
Answer me in a really, really honest way.

641
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:16,010
I'll tell you, too.

642
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:17,140
What is it that I should answer?

643
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,130
My real name has only one syllables.

00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,670

645
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:30,900
My parents wanted me to be well off,

646
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,340
so they hired someone to come up with my name despite being poor.

647
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,730
Apparently that clairvoyant said it had to be that name.

648
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,220
But I prefer Sunny.

649
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,960
It gives off the impression that I'm sparkling.

650
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,190

I won't tease you even if your real name doesn't suit you,

00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,030

01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:59,040
Are your hands cold? Give me your hands.

675
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,120
Massaging your hands will allow blood to circulate well.

676
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:09,730
I'm sorry, but can you look at my eyes, please?

677
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,690
What?

678
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:15,830
Let's say that this meeting never took place today.

679
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,540
I'm sorry that I couldn't walk you home.

680
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:21,140
Go back home.

681
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:39,730
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

682
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,590
Where did he go?

683
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,830
In the future,

684
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:00,640
you will have to take care of the Lord.

685
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:04,230
So you must remember this day well.

686
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:07,240
Why is he sending off the lantern? Who are they for?

687
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,940
They are the people

688
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:14,600
whom Lord has been feeling sorry about for a long time.

689
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,370
But Grandpa! Did you know that there was a sword stuck in my uncle's heart?

690
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,410
How do you know that?

691
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:27,360
You should not let him know that you know about it.

692
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,980
Why?

693
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,080
<i>That sword is</i>

694
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,910
<i>an award as well as a punishment for our Lord.</i>

695
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,320
<i>It's the reason for his existence</i>

696
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,740
<i>and will lead to his end. </i>

697
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,230
<i> You who are my life as well as </i>

698
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,860
<i> my death, </i>

699
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:36,720
<i> I love you. </i>

700
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:41,180
<i> Therefore, I'm keeping a secret </i>

701
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,940
<i> and asking a higher power for its permission, </i>

702
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:49,670
<i>so that you won't know for even just one more day.</i>

703
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,130
<i> So that you won't know for a hundred years.</i>

704
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:45,290
You know me, right? There are some things that I should let you know.

705
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:47,530
You have some time, don't you?

706
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:50,320
Be quick, will you?

707
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:54,490
I'm not in the right mood to face any gods at the moment.

708
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:02,220
Something went wrong...

709
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:07,490
Probably...

710
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,410
everything started from you.

711
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:21,310
Where on earth did he go?

712
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,420
This is why I told him to let me know before leaving

713
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:29,930
even if he reappears without telling me.

714
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,160
What are you curious about?

715
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,290
Oh, yes.

716
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:44,680
I think I already told you once.

717
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:48,230
<i>You'll have to be prepared for me to leave to a place that's farther away once the bride appears.</i>

718
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,930
There's something that I'm feeling weird about.

719
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,210
About the sword in Mister Goblin's heart,

720
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,760
what will precisely happen

721
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,970
when the sword gets pulled out?

722
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,540
He kept mentioning that he was going to go somewhere.

723
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:07,280
<i>- So you're not leaving anymore? <br>- For now.</i>

724
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:11,180
<i> I might have to prepare to leave for a place farther away.</i>

725
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,520
Where is that place?

726
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,830
Get that sword pulled out of you as soon as you can.

727
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,150
Get it pulled out and disappear.

728
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:34,630
You appeared out of nowhere and the first thing you're telling me is to die...

729
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:37,130
You should at least explain to me your reasons.

730
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:39,660
You've lived enough.

731
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:42,290
But that's not the case for that kid.

732
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:46,070
I was really happy when I found out her identity. So just...

733
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:48,930
end things right now.

734
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:54,000
That's ironic.

735
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:58,430
I don't know what decision you're telling me to make.

736
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:01,660
And when I was first born as Kim Shin,

737
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,550
you must have been the one who blessed me.

738
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,690
Aren't I your child?

739
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,840
That's why I'm telling you all this.

740
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:12,740
For my kid, Kim Shin, whom I wanted to be happy,

741
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:16,650
it must be something you want the most.

742
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:19,880
- What do I want? <br> - You want that kid to live.

743
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:22,130
If you don't become nothing,

744
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,930
Eun Tak will die.

745
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,570
What you're saying is that

746
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:32,870
it's because he wants to die

747
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:36,640
that he asked me to become his bride

748
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:40,350
and pull out that sword?

749
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:48,080
So,

750
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,040
if I pull out that sword,

751
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,890
he will die?

752
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,090
That is,

753
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:07,950
if I pull out that sword,

754
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:12,890
he will disappear?

755
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:16,000
From this world? Forever?

756
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:30,800
Ever since she was born, she's been fated to pull out that sword for you.

757
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,980
To be more precise, you caused her to be born with that fate.

758
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,280
If she fails to execute her task as a tool, the reason for her existence will disappear

759
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:44,010
because then there won't be any reason why she should exist.

760
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,360
Therefore, if she doesn't pull the sword out,

761
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,790
she will keep facing death.

762
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:51,150
I'm sure she's already confronted death multiple times.

763
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:56,110
<i>- This thing!<br> - Good bye!</i>

764
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,230
You're thinking right, those accidents...

765
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,630
There will be more in the future.

766
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:11,070
Those accidents will take place more frequently, and they'll be more intense.

767
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:13,780
Even you almost killed her

768
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:16,320
with your own hands...

769
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,290
<i> It's moving!</i>

770
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,940
<i>After living one hundred years like that, one day,</i>

771
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,290
<i>when the day is good enough,</i>

772
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,220
<i>there came first love.</i>

773
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:49,720
<i>Please let me be able to confess...</i>

774
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:53,160
<i>I'm seeking</i>

775
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:56,450
