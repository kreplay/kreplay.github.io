2
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,840
I asked how did you know?

3
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,610
I asked why you know!

4
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,050
I said... Miss Kim Sunny.

5
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,210
Ah, it's very cold, isn't it? I'll get your coat--

6
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,130
I wasn't finished talking!

7
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,340
What's the matter?

8
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,670
Just why...

9
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,030
What? Are you alright?

10
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,280
Your pale face just got paler.

11
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,910
<i>Who's this woman that you saw?</i>

12
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:55,070
<i>That woman... is my sister.</i>

13
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,590
You'll bore a hole through the window.

14
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,260
Ji Eun Tak.

15
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,790
Even if you look at me gently like that, it's still too late.

16
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,230
What kind of person is your boss?

17
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,530
I've heard this question before from Mr. Grim Reaper.

18
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,080
The question that follows is, "What do I have to do in order for her to like me?"

19
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,380
Can't you see by looking at her? She's pretty. Absolutely beautiful.

20
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,600
I'm... not looking for someone pretty.

21
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,800
I've heard that before as well.

22
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,860
What's the matter?

23
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,320
Why? What is it?

24
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,390
Well, it shouldn't be your first time holding a woman's hand--

25
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,700
I see right through you! You said you don't have a phone number, then you get one.

26
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,300
You don't even tell me your real name. You're serious because I grabbed your hand.

27
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,160
Are you married by any chance?

28
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,760
No.

29
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,790
Then, there's only one other explanation. Always wearing black,

30
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,120
and your face is way too pale.

31
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,480
- Are you part of the NIS? (National Intelligence Service)<br>- No.

32
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,160
Then, are you a Grim Reaper?

33
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,440
You're not laughing. It was a joke.

34
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,460
If you're not married or part of the NIS, then fine. Let's go in, it's cold.

35
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,170
Then, Ms. Sunny, who are you?

36
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,860
You're going to drink?

37
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,260
Yeah. I really want to get drunk right now. You should have one, too.

38
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,130
Look here, Orabeoni (older brother). Why do you keep looking at me since earlier?

39
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,730
I'm fascinated because you have the same name as someone I know.

40
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,080
Your real name is Kim Sun? How do you write your name in Korean characters?

41
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,130
I don't use Korean characters. I use English. S-U-N-N-Y.

42
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,740
Have you seen me somewhere before?

43
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,340
We saw each other a few days ago. In front of the old store.

44
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,160
Even then, and now. Why do you keep calling me Orabeoni (older brother)?

45
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,990
Then should I have said this, that, hey, you?

46
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:55,310
What's your relationship with this person? <br>Do you even know what he is that you're meeting him?

47
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:03,060
A relationship where we exchanged rings.

48
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,560
That ring had that kind of meaning?

49
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,080
Part-time worker, nice question.

50
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,850
This ring... what was the meaning?

51
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:21,700
About the ring... can you give it back to me?

52
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,490
At the cafe we met at before, tomorrow afternoon, at one o'clock.

53
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,710
Now what does this mean?

54
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,710
<i>Truth number one.</i>

55
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,880
<i>The girl in the painting and Sunny's past life</i>

56
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,070
<i>had the same face.</i> Truth number two.

57
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,210
The girl in the painting...

58
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,930
<i>That woman... is my sister.</i>

59
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,250
Is Kim Shin's sister. Then a question.

60
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:55,610
Is Sunny a reincarnation of Kim Shin's sister?

61
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,980
I don't know as of yet. Again. Truth one.

62
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:10,090
<i>The moment I saw the girl in the painting, I cried. Truth number two.</i>

63
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,830
<i>The moment I first saw Sunny, I cried.</i>

64
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,820
<i>Then a question.</i>

65
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:27,510
Why did I cry? What is the truth behind my feelings?

66
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:34,410
Does their history have something to do with my erased memories?

67
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,000
Ah, this is also a maybe.

68
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,320
"How much is a chicken? I could buy the entire chicken store." After making such a huge boast, the Grim Reaper paid for the meal.

69
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,440
- About that, I was a bit distracted, so--<br>- How could you have been distracted the whole time?

70
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,920
I mean, if you weren't even going to pay, why are you so curious <br>about the relationship between my boss and the Grim Reaper?

71
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,810
Why didn't you just ask her what she can see in you? Seriously, men are all the same.

72
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,630
Whether they're human, a goblin or a grim reaper.

73
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,400
It wasn't the kind of a picture you are thinking about.

74
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,600
It was that kind of a picture. I told you not to keep secrets from me anymore.

75
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,350
Ah, were you waiting for this day? Is that why you brought me to that chicken store? Because my boss was pretty?

76
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,720
I'm telling you now, but how could I have picked that part-time job for you?

77
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,890
What are you talking about now?

78
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:41,950
All I did was narrow the choices. I narrowed it down to chicken stores, so it would be easier.

79
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,830
And if I told you that you were going to be hired, then you would gain confidence. And another person would hire you.

80
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,440
Such crappy lies.

81
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,160
What lies?

82
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,750
Then I have two wishes that haven't come true yet. Part-time and boyfriend.

83
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,270
Why do you keep hanging onto the boyfriend part?

84
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,310
Should I break Tae Hee's legs and confirm whether or not I'm your boyfriend or not?

85
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:09,070
If I break something, maybe then you will go, <br>"That's right, my boyfriend is a foul-tempered Goblin!"

86
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,540
Why is he the one getting angry?

87
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,720
What? I didn't say anything.

88
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,790
Seeing you work there, it made me feel bad. It's the first time I've seen you there properly.

89
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,550
Good night.

90
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,940
Are you doing well?

91
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:27,920
I finally... seem to be doing well.

92
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,240
What about the ring? I'll take the ring for a little and then I'll give it back--

93
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,540
If you tell me the reason.

94
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,440
I have something to investigate. The details of the investigation are a bit classified.

95
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,660
But, Sunny, why did you grab this particular ring on that day?

96
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,970
It seemed like it was mine.

97
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,650
When you wore the ring, did you feel something?

98
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,990
I did. "I grabbed this ring to meet this man."

99
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,510
A man who cries the moment he sees me. A man who doesn't concede.

100
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,610
A man where our meetings are short and waiting is long.

101
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,460
But I didn't know that man would give and take the ring.

102
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,700
Here you go.

103
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,210
Thank you. I will return it soon.

104
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:34,500
I don't know how you are when it comes to investigating, but I'm not that easy going either, so share with me the results.

105
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,480
Since I have a right to that ring, too.

106
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,530
I'll go. I have to open the store.

107
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,710
I'm saying this because I'm not sure if you know, <br>but I don't think that's the right dressing for that dish.

108
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,020
Oh.

109
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,780
Come to your senses and prepare lunch. (words sound very similar)

110
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,130
Did you fail to take away the ring?

111
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,260
I just borrowed it for a little bit.

112
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,490
That's what you call taking. Why would you borrow something you gave?

113
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,700
I saw that you even held her hand last night. <br>Did you see something of an enemy from your past life?

114
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,780
Don't ask me. It's their own privacy, and even if I did see it, <br>I can't say anything about it. It's one of the rules.

115
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:41,090
Wow, you have some conscience. So why would someone like that date a human being while hiding that you're a grim reaper?

116
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,900
Must you say things that way when you're in the same position as I am?

117
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:51,290
What do you mean we're in the same position? <br>Mine is fateful love, and you should quit putting ketchup on tofu.

118
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,580
Oh.

119
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,910
My sister's name was also Kim Sun,

120
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,480
so I was a little bit uneasy all night.

121
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,530
You said you don't know if she reincarnated or not.

122
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:17,800
If she reincarnated with a different face, there's no way for me to recognize her. Since all I can see of humans are their paths ahead.

123
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,590
Say that your sister reincarnated and you met her.

124
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:27,950
Then what would happen? Your sister wouldn't remember anything about her past life.

125
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:34,920
Just... whether she's peaceful in this lifetime, whether she's doing well.

126
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,630
If she's receiving love. I'm just curious about those things.

127
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,040
She was pretty. My little rascal.

128
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,270
<i>Continue talking.</i>

129
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,980
<i>About what?</i>

130
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,090
<i>Your story. How you lived, how you died.</i>

131
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:03,990
<i>I told you already. I was a general.</i><br> I was in the Goryeo army.

132
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,450
Did you die on the battlefield?

133
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,970
No. I was killed by the blade of the master I was protecting.

134
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,620
I don't know where or how to start. It's a story I never told.

135
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,490
The salt.

136
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,320
Oh, yeah.

137
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,160
A baby was born. And when he was born, his father who was king had already passed.

138
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,600
<i>His mother was lowly born, and she died from an illness.</i>

139
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,300
<i>And his older brother who was old enough to be his father was the king.</i>

140
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:46,410
There was no one who was on his side in the palace. Just Park Jong Won who was his teacher and a professor at Seonggyungwan.

141
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:53,750
<i>After he met Park Jong Won, strange things happened around the child.</i>

142
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,860
<i>His nephew who was next in line to the throne died, and the officials who were questioning the matter died, too.</i>

143
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,340
<i>And his older brother who was king also died.</i>

144
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:12,250
<i>They all passed away due to hereditary illness, but he finds out later</i>

145
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,740
that they were all poisoned.<i></i>

146
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,670
<i>The king and the army met violent deaths, and all that's left is regret.</i>

147
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,390
<i>If Yeo ascends to the royal throne,</i>

148
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,860
<i>please marry Yeo to your sister and protect him.</i>

149
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:14,620
<i>Only let him walk on the righteous path and prevent him from making the wrong choices; and more than anything,</i>

150
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,950
<i>please prevent him from dying.</i>

151
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,370
<i>And tell him that by not being there for him, I protected him.</i>

152
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,300
<i>And also, your master who is giving this order,</i>

153
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,630
<i>please forgive me.</i>

154
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,740
<i>I will follow your order.</i>

155
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,490
Are you saying that he poisoned everyone over such a long period of time and made the child become the king?

156
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,830
That man, Park Jong Won did? But why...

157
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,860
With barely enough time to put on his royal attire, he became the king.

158
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,930
<i>They say that I cannot become the king because there is a separate royal lineage,</i>

159
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,550
<i>so I will raise and make a king myself,</i>

160
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,520
<i>and put this world at this king's feet,</i>

161
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,200
<i>and put that king at my feet.</i>

162
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,690
<i>Therefore, I will put the whole country at my feet.</i>

163
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,760
<i>May you be well for a thousand years.</i>

164
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:57,800
<i>According to the wishes of the late king, your marriage date has been set, Your Majesty.</i>

165
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,550
<i>I hear it's General Kim Shin's sister.</i>

166
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,080
<i>With Kim Shin's character and the family's integrity,</i>

167
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,530
<i>she's not lacking in any way against any other young lady.</i>

168
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:15,090
<i>A marriage to a petty military official's sister? It would have been nice if the late king had withheld his last wish.</i>

169
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:21,420
<i>The late king said that Kim Shin is a loyal subject and a reassuring comrade who fought many battles with him,</i>

170
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,320
<i>and said that he was a great trusted... friend.</i>

171
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,830
<i>The late king's last wish became a variable in Park Jong Won's solid plans to have complete control over the king.</i>

172
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,510
<i>I couldn't see you since this morning,</i>

173
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,370
<i>so I thought I was going to get married without seeing you.</i>

174
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:24,070
<i>I should have. I have no idea what I find pretty in such an ugly face to come here.</i>

175
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,340
<i>Seeing how you treasure me, my path into the palace is just so pretty. </i>

176
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,750
<i>But then, Orabeoni, what does the king look like?</i>

177
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,650
<i>Why is it that you are not curious about his character but more about his looks?</i>

178
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,620
<i>Don't worry. His royal appearance is very bright. </i>

179
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,800
<i>Is that true?</i>

180
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,660
<i>What about me? Am I pretty today?</i>

181
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,630
<i>You look ugly.</i>

182
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,380
<i>Then I must be not pretty in the king's eyes? I should probably return home then?</i>

183
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,290
<i>The king has already seen you.</i>

184
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,800
<i>Me?</i>

185
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,260
<i>Perhaps... is it the one whose face was radiating?</i>

186
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,820
<i>So he came to see me. What did he say about me?</i>

187
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,080
<i>He said you were ugly.</i>

188
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,430
<i>You have to come see your ugly sister often.</i>

189
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,900
<i>Your brother lives on the battlefield. </i>

190
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,520
<i>Here, no news is good news.</i>

191
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,020
<i>As if I didn't know.</i>

192
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,280
<i>Don't worry about me. I will be happy, Orabeoni.</i>

193
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,640
♬ <i> When I look at you </i> ♬

194
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,490
♬ <i> my tears keep on falling </i> ♬

195
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,710
<i>His Majesty's coming.</i>

196
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:51,720
♬ <i> round and round, are you coming to me? </i> ♬

197
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,740
♬ <i> That person that I can't seem to avoid. </i> ♬

198
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:05,310
♬ <i> I love you, love you, love you. </i> ♬

199
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:12,950
♬ <i> I felt it was destined. </i> ♬

200
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:19,550
♬ <i> And I miss you, miss you </i> ♬

201
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:26,700
♬ <i> My fated person </i> ♬

202
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,530
<i>You're heavy.</i>

203
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,610
<i>Ah!</i>

204
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:37,490
<i>I was thinking of someone who is cold-hearted.</i>

205
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,570
<i>Where are you going in such a rush?</i>

206
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,950
<i>To see the king.</i>

207
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,810
<i>I would have come to you.</i>

208
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:50,830
<i>I thought it would be better if we both came out.</i>

209
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,790
<i>You ought to control how much power you put in your grasp of the lowly thing. </i>

210
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:24,490
<i>If your grasp is tight as though you treasure it, that lowly and precious thing </i>

211
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,070
<i>will die without fail.</i>

212
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,910
<i>In that hand, </i>

213
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,870
<i>a foolish child, a lowly maternal family, </i>

214
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:47,210
<i>a wife's family that is even lower than the mother's family. </i>

215
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,130
<i>That is a few grand ministers and </i>

216
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,800
<i>Chancellor Shin Cheol Jool's conversation, as I'm told. </i>

217
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,160
<i>Is there nothing wrong in what you said?</i>

218
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,060
<i>The more there isn't anything wrong, the more you say it's wrong!</i>

219
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,830
<i>Cut off the head of Shin Cheol Jool who put the royal family to contempt </i>

220
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:11,240
<i>and insist he's wrong. Show them your power. </i>

221
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,580
<i>Don't confuse the king anymore.</i>

222
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,090
<i>Please do not cover his eyes any longer.</i>

223
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,470
<i>The chancellor's death was not a proper treatment. </i>

224
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:30,980
<i>Everyone says I did no wrong. Only you say I did. </i>

225
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,550
<i>- Must you really-- <br>- Did I cover his eyes</i>

226
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,000
<i>or did His Majesty close his eyes? </i>

227
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,710
<i>- You insolent!<br>- You wench!</i>

228
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,150
<i>The late king gave him life but I raised him. </i>

229
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,970
<i>There is no reason why I am not Yeo's father.</i>

230
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,310
<i>The one who put Yeo on the royal throne and the one<br> who put the world in Yeo's grasp, that's all me. </i>

231
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,140
<i>Did I say anything wrong?</i>

232
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,240
<i>So, just some lowly sister of some petty military officer,</i>

233
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,800
<i>shove your admonitions. </i>

234
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,410
<i>I'm not the one you should be lecturing to. It's your brother.</i>

235
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:11,800
<i>To the borders where he was sent to be buried, </i>

236
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,530
<i>he is still victorious.</i>

237
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,970
<i>Isn't that will of his quite vicious? </i>

238
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:25,410
<i>They are saying there's two kings to one nation. </i>

239
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:31,560
<i>Two suns in one sky.</i>

240
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,320
<i>If that is not treason then...</i>

241
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,510
<i>what is?</i>

242
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:50,990
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

243
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,840
<i>I cast you the sword with fury and empathy. </i>

244
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:14,640
<i>Go as far as you can and do not come back if possible.</i>

245
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,750
<i>Your Highness... how could those words... Your Highness, how?</i>

246
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,830
<i>It is your Goryeo.</i>

247
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,440
<i>I protected the borders when you told me to protect the borders.</i>

248
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,300
<i>I killed the enemies when you told me to kill them.</i>

249
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,270
<i>- My sister and people are here...<br>- The worries of the king...</i>

250
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,770
<i>It seems like you're the one who has them.</i>

251
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:43,270
<i>Send a message that you died a heroic death and I will send a message that I lament it. </i>

252
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,070
<i>It's an order.</i>

253
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:07,310
<i>May you not only be biased against the military officer.</i>

254
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,570
<i>May you not treat him lowly for being a military officer.</i>

255
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,590
<i>May you</i>

256
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:17,910
<i>summon High General Kim Shin who is near the borders to your be by your side to protect you. </i>

257
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,910
<i>And more than anything,</i>

258
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,840
<i>I hope you keep Park Jong Won far away.</i>

259
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,590
<i>In the end this is what it comes to.</i>

260
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:31,050
<i>Your lacking, in the end, has only become greed. </i>

261
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:35,180
<i>Did your brother say you are the only hope for your family of low status? </i>

262
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,060
<i>- Your Highness...<br>- The king protects his people.</i>

263
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,930
<i>How could the people protect its king?</i>

264
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,610
<i>Do you even know what you are requesting now? <br>The person that you are calling your brother...</i>

265
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,380
<i>He keeps coming back from battles that are not supposed to be won. </i>

266
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,600
<i>He has become a god in the streets.</i>

267
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:58,240
<i>I told him not to come back but he comes back time after time to show my incompetence. </i>

268
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,940
<i>Your brother, how would I know if he would protect me or stab me with that sword?</i>

269
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,450
<i>Your Highness...</i>

270
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,570
<i>More than anyone, no one can be a god for my people.</i>

271
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,840
<i>That is what treason is. </i>

272
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,280
<i>Your Highness.</i>

273
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,050
<i>A petty military officer is gaining power.</i>

274
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:28,180
<i>As the military officer's power grows, the royal family is put into a dire crisis. </i>

275
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,860
<i>Strike the head of High General Kim Shin. </i>

276
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:38,200
<i>Insist he's wrong and show your power. </i>

277
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,170
<i>From Park Jong Won's mouth,</i>

278
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:45,060
<i>Kim Shin's name came out in the end.</i>

279
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:24,280
<i>That is... the last image of my sister.</i>

280
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:31,340
<i>She was the sister of a military officer and a queen with depth. </i>

281
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,450
<i>The road to the king was far.</i>

282
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,510
<i>In the end I could not reach it.</i>

283
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:47,010
Even though I knew I could not reach it... even after knowing that... I...

284
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,880
I could only go on forward.

285
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,320
That place was my last war and I was to die there.

286
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,810
Why on earth?

287
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:06,930
<i>I disregarded the command not to return. I disregarded the young king's jealousy and fears.</i>

288
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:11,300
<i>I couldn't forget the late king's words to protect Yeo.</i>

289
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,300
<i>I needed to save the lives of the innocent.</i>

290
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,780
And above all else, my sister was protecting that dummy's life with her life.

291
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:29,770
I've blabbered too much in front of someone who doesn't have any memories of his past life.

292
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,250
The food is all cold.

293
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,080
I have one more thing I am curious about.

294
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:41,450
Perhaps, have you seen a ring like this?

295
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,380
You didn't take that back to give to me, right?<br> I don't want to be in that kind of relationship with you.

296
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,910
Concentrate please. Look at it properly. Have you seen this?

297
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,610
You, perhaps do you wish you were my sister?

298
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,580
Is that why you asked about my past? Put on the ring. Let's see what happens.

299
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,810
Don't come close. Don't come close, I said!

300
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,580
Sun, are you receiving love now?

301
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,380
Ahhhh!

302
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,630
I'm sorry for disrupting your cozy time.

303
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,160
- It's not cozy!<br>- I will go out somewhere first.

304
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,880
Where are you going? Let's go together. We have to be a set now.

305
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,080
That's right. You two go out as a set.

306
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,450
- I want to be alone now.<br>- My Sun also liked to be alone.

307
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,310
Leave. I said, leave!

308
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:32,220
Jeong Hyeon told me that I must come see her with flowers.

309
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,640
She said she's in Paju.

310
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,240
It's nice since it's closer than Canada.

311
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,460
Mister, you really match well with flowers.

312
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,650
Any flower.

313
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,720
Mister, you are really my style. In every way.

314
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:59,890
Mister, you have a really good personality.

315
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,880
Did I do something wrong?

316
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,860
- No.<br>- Then did you do something wrong?

317
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,630
No.

318
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,860
Then what is this confession suddenly out of the blue?

319
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,170
Comfort? Encouragement? There is something like that.

320
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,700
How am I your style specifically?

321
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,060
Strange and beautiful.

322
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,170
It's here. Go Jeong Hyeon.

323
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,390
I'm here.

324
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,600
Mom?

325
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:18,580
Mom... I think it's her.

326
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,340
It is Mom.

327
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,150
Miser. Door, door. To the library. Hurry!

328
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,180
Be careful! You might fall!

329
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,980
Were you my mom's friend?

330
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,180
Miss. Do you know my mom?

331
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,260
Ji Yeon Hee. Do you know her?

332
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,960
Why would I be by your side then?

333
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,640
I was there because you are her daughter.

334
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:12,060
In our time, we really used an iron to laminate.

335
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,350
Yeon Hee helped me a lot with mine.

336
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,410
We promised when we were in high school that

337
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,210
when we would have babies, we would buy pretty clothes.

338
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:26,070
I wasn't able to give a dress but I protected Yeon Hee's money.

339
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,850
Open it. The code is 486.

340
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,330
These bankbooks... could it be?

341
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,070
Yeah. You're right.

342
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,290
The bankbook you always told your aunt you did not have.

343
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,840
That is Yeon Hee's insurance money.

344
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,150
The one on top is the most recent one.

345
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,700
So add it in for your college tuition.

346
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,050
Congratulations on passing.

347
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:21,260
Because of this... you wandered and could not go?

348
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,720
Because of me?

349
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,080
While I was wandering around,

350
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,310
I did feel the fun in watching you grow up.

351
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,820
Now, I should go and chat with Yeon Hee.

352
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,150
You're going? Now?

353
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:49,660
I should go and tell everything without missing a single thing to your mom.

354
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,000
Your daughter is so kind.

355
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,410
She's good in her studies, too.

356
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,240
She went to a good college.

360
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:22,050
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

361
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,020
With my mom...

362
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,360
I hope the both of you

363
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,830
stay friends over there.

364
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,760

No, honestly she was my friend.

374
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,040
I liked everything you did.

375
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,720
The rice cakes and the feast.

376
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,130

00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,420
I am that big of a person.

382
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,900
Did you just sneer at me?

383
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,910
Oh! Rain. It's not raining these days.

384
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm restraining myself. NASA might come and get me.

385
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,910
It's been a long time.

386
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,770
You haven't changed a bit. You still talk informally.

387
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,170
<i>Mr. Yoo Jae Shin!</i>

388
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,100
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

389
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,240
As you can see, I am a very complicated person.

390
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,630
- I have something I want to ask of you.<br>- Yes.

391
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,320
There is insurance money.

392
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,430
One that was left before one child's mother died.

393
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:45,990
The child isn't turning 20 until September of next year.

394
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,740
So, as of now, this money is

395
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,040
hard to touch without the Aunt's approval.

396
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,780
So the insurance money should go to the rightful owner.

397
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,640
Rightfully.

398
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,050
You don't have to worry. I will take care of it immediately.

399
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,110
Then.

400
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:09,260
- One more thing.<br>- Yes.

401
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,650
Thank you for growing up properly.

402
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,670
I am thankful for everything.

403
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,740
My sister is dead. The child is young and the insurance money is out.

404
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,080
But you can't be the guardian if you have debt.

405
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,210
So what can you do? Humaneness is a disease, too.

406
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,950
I paid back all that debt in order to become the guardian.

407
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,090
So I got the insurance money.

408
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,750
But I can't deposit it into my account.

409
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,870
- Since you paid the debt by getting a private loan.<br>- That's right!

410
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,460
So, I put it first in that girl, Eun Tak's savings account.

411
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,160
But this damn bankbook kept disappearing!

412
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:04,340
So how happy would I be to see that bankbook?

413
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,360
I'm not sure if you understood what I said.

414
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,540
The law will understand.

415
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,300
And you acknowledged that you tried to deviate the insurance money.

416
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,850
What?

417
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,200
What crap are you trying to pull here? Dev, what?

418
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:23,840
Because I was so worried about our delicate Eun Tak,

419
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,640
I raised her preciously like some gold or jade!

420
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,250
Stop saying such nonsense.

421
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,840
I will offer you two choices. One:

422
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,900
A simple and an efficient way, return the full amount back to Ms. Ji Eun Tak.

423
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,960
Two: Dirtily insist on getting back child rearing expenses

424
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,860
by filing a lawsuit.

425
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,870
Please select between one and two.

426
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,550
You... You had me all wrong.

427
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:51,280
You see, I know a lot of people on the dark side.

428
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,860
I think... you are the one who has me all wrong.

429
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,900
The dark side...

430
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,380
I know better.

431
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:09,560
What about the Lord's situation?

432
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:13,290
It has been settled well. And Deok Hwa has been instructed as you have instructed.

433
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:17,780
Starting with one desk, one chair, he's to learn how to be a new recruit at the store first.

434
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,700
Right.

435
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,730
- Mr. Yoo Deok Hwa?<br>- Yes.

436
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,970
I am Yoo Deok Hwa.

437
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,660
It's nice that this store is clean.

438
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,580
Go and work.

439
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,910
This is the details about the products.

440
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,170
You should memorize this by tomorrow.

441
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,230
Ohh! It goes up! It goes down!

442
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,250
Woah! It slants.

443
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,260
- Woah! You're still standing.<br>- Mr. Yoo Deok Hwa!

444
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:55,150
That... Manager Jang Il Ryeong,

445
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,380
if you were to know the truth, you would be really surprised.

446
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:02,140
Someone surprising that's from way up there who starts from the bottom.

447
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,930
I know that you are the Chairman's grandson.

448
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:08,080
He instructed that we follow the field manual. (army-like disciplining)

449
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,980
Exactly. If I memorize this all in one day,

450
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,610
you would probably be surprised.

451
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,540
Yes, customer. What brings you here?

452
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,710
To get the hat that I left for dry cleaning.

453
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,270
Ahhh! That hat!

454
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,010
That hat's material was so good.

455
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,590
Is it from Italy?

456
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,900
It's "Made in Heaven."

457
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,040
Ahhh... no wonder.

458
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,560
The materials there are good.

459
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,420
Oh! Why did it suddenly get so cold?

460
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,940
- Hello?<br>- Are you still investigating?

461
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,240
I haven't been lax about it.

462
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,630
Yes, not yet.

463
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,680
It must be a complicated investigation.

464
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,310
What were you doing right now?

465
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,650
I was thinking about

466
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:32,640
<i>if I should hold your hand once more or not.</i>

467
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,880
I'm going crazy.

468
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,790
Then, can't you come and hold me today when I'm still a year younger?

469
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,620
Today?

470
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,930
I'm going out.

471
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,820
<i>Don't call me from now on.</i>

472
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,660
Is it today?

473
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,940
- What is?<br>- Can you not wear that coat today?

474
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,160
Why? Is it strange?

475
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,580
Never mind.

476
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:08,280
I was hoping that my advice could be a variable to your day but...

477
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,800
Wear more comfortable shoes. The way back will be long.

478
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,020
Your clothes are strange.

479
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:18,310
When the laundry is done, just hang those up!

480
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:19,980
He disgustingly doesn't do any housework.

481
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,310
Lucky wench.

482
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:25,020
Someone is just eating chicken feet at home.

483
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,430
Having a man to date.

484
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,590
December 31st date, you say.

485
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,000
I'm so proud of you, friend.

486
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,080
Today's date concept is...

487
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,380
sweet and warm.

488
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:49,020
- Is it pretty?<br>- Disgustingly pretty.

489
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:53,300
I can't make it obvious that I am one year older on a date.

490
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:03,070
<i>Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @Viki</i>

491
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:29,400
I am sorry for being late. It is hard to walk if there are a lot of people.

492
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,970
But you came before I'm a year older. Should we walk towards Bosingak? (a bell pavillion)

493
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:37,570
Before that, I will hold your hand.

494
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,400
Right away? This suddenly?

495
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,070
Because I am too curious to wait.

496
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,370
Human nature is quite strange, don't you think? It makes me want to play hard to get.

497
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,710
- Do you want to hold my hand?<br>- Yes.

498
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,380
Me, too.

499
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:06,580
I want to hold your hand and hug you.

500
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,180
But then, at the least, whose hand I am holding

501
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,910
or whose embrace I am in, I need to know.

502
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:19,370
You still haven't answered my question properly.

503
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,890
What is your identity, Mr. Kim Woo Bin?

504
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:24,820
You still have not answered as to how you knew my real name.

505
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:29,050
Just letting things pass because you're handsome is only up to this year.

506
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,250
And after two hours, it will be next year.

507
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,590
Am I asking for too much?

508
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,490
I'm sorry.

509
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,230
Okay.

510
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,420
Then should we stop?

511
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,600
Making me walk in the inner part of the pavement is cute.

512
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,240
You were cute too when you were answering those math questions.

513
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,320
Everything is good, but...

514
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,080
I don't think I can do it anymore.

515
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,220
I'll just get dumped.

516
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,860
Don't contact me from now on.

517
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,340
Don't greet me even if we see each other coincidentally, too.

518
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,940
Happy New Year!

519
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,900
Mister, Mister!

520
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,970
<i>Come in.</i>

521
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,280
What is it? I was sleeping.

522
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,070
- Like that? <br>- Yeah, this is how I always sleep. Why?

523
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:52,760
I got it. Listen carefully, Mister.

524
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,690
What?

525
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:03,870
Mister, 12 o'clock strikes! January 1st, the New Year! I just became an adult!

526
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,410
So what about it? What do you want? Why are you all dressed?

527
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:10,820
I've got a prior appointment. I'm going out. Since I'm an adult now.

528
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,340
You?

529
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,450
What prior appointment in this late at night? Are you out of your--

530
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,260
It's a prior appointment with you.

531
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,230
So I already got dressed since earlier . . .

532
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,130
Dummy, must I say it in words?

533
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:25,320
Yea. Say it from now on instead of drying up my blood. (torturous)

534
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,990
Go out? What do you want to do?

535
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,700
You'll do it for me?

536
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,860
Whatever it is, if you say to do it, I'll do that, too.

537
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,050
Mister. Alcohol. Alcohol. Buy me alcohol.

538
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:44,640
At the street bar. Soju and chicken gizzard. And romance, too.

539
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,730
What?

540
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,280
Then, let's go, into romance!

541
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,580
Here, toast between adults.

542
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,590
Are you going to be okay...

543
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,870
It's romantic.

544
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:08,070
Oh, bitter. Is soju supposed to be bitter?

545
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:12,290
Alcohol is all supposed to be bitter. When that becomes sweet is when you're really an adult.

546
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:17,680
Then, one more cup. Pour it. Fill it.

547
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,710
- Cheers.<br>- Cheers.

548
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:28,920
♬ <i> Love, under the moonlight</i> ♬

549
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,800
Oh sweet... bitter.

550
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,080
Bitter.

551
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,670
Nice picture.

552
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,540
♬ <i> same feeling as me</i> ♬

553
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,830
What's this trite development?

554
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:44,250
Mister, you hired them?

555
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,060
I didn't but I have met him before.

556
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,190
I just knew you lived in this neighborhood.

557
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:53,570
I was looking very hard for you.

558
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,590
It's him. The punk that did this to me.

559
00:53:56,590 --> 00:54:02,260
He wrecked my hand like this and what a good life he has to be playing with a chick.

560
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,300
You'll die today.

561
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,600
Today? Really? Tell me everything you see.

562
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,230
What is he saying?

563
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,990
For your amusement.

564
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:18,450
Eat the food and wait. Wait for me with the drinks. I'll be short.

565
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:22,410
Our battlefield is outside. Come out.

566
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,020
What? Where did he go?

567
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,480
I told you he's weird.

568
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,620
Let's go outside.

569
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,140
Are you sure it's okay for your boyfriend to go out like that?

570
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:38,180
Those guys are infamously wicked in this neighborhood.

571
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:42,870
Oh, it's okay. He's not a mister who goes around getting beat up.

572
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,810
Auntie, one more bottle of soju.

573
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:59,080
Shall I deal with you in a classic way after some time of absence from it? I used to be a military officer.

574
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:03,740
And I'm currently unemployed, bastard. Thanks to you.

575
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:08,410
How can that be the life of a great man? You guys, too.

576
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:14,110
That's the reason I won't be easy on you today. It'll hurt. Endure if you want.

577
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,310
What is he saying?

578
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:19,870
Hey, break him into pieces.

579
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,600
Nice.

580
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,710
Hurry.

581
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:20,180
Let's start from the beginning again, the romance.

582
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,940
It's still romantic?

583
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:30,240
More than earlier.

584
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:36,480
Fading light, simple food, bitter soju,

585
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:43,090
cold-hearted sentiment, romance brimming everywhere.

586
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,920
It'd be perfect with just one more thing.

587
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,280
What?

588
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,610
My first kiss.

589
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:50,400
What?

590
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:56,410
Last time, it was a peck. Don't move.

591
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,520
Hey.

592
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,500
You...

593
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:23,660
You forgot I'm the goblin bride? It doesn't work on me.

594
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:29,750
It means you can't ever evade me no matter what.

595
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,280
I wasn't evading.

596
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,470
It was hard to evade you even once.

597
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:39,030

♬ <i> This beautiful life </i> ♬

607
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:40,480
Did she get dumped or did I get dumped?

608
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,650
What are you doing, Miscellaneously Omitted person?

609
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,440
So what are you doing?

610
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,820
Good morning.

611
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:10,220
It's New Year's and I'm thankful to you, too, so I was making rice cake soup.

612
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,710
I made buckwheat jelly, too.

613
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,170
You're precious starting from New Year's already.

614
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:17,930
My pay from the ski resort came in so I bought good beef, too.

615
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:21,910
No beef in my rice cake.

616
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:23,440
Yes.

617
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:32,290
It seems like yesterday when you guys walked towards me like models through the night fog.

618
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:37,620
It's already New Year's. Back then, you guys were so dashing.

619
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:42,010
Amidst being scared, you guys looked so totally dashing.

620
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:44,980
Wait a bit.

621
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,500
Oh, green onion! I didn't buy green onions.

622
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,550
Rice cake soup without green onions will be quite hopeless.

623
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:52,510
Green onions are important indeed. Shall we go?

624
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:55,150
Shall we then?

625
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,610
Move over! Do you guys own this?

626
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:38,360
It seems he just gave us a word of blessing for the new year, to use the sidewalk.

627
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:43,870
I'm grateful for your blessing so I shall not do you harm. May you have a good new year.

628
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:47,950
Since we are dashing. Happy New Year!

629
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:53,290
- A righteous buddy he is.<br>- Rare in today's world.

630
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:55,980
It's beautiful.

631
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,900
Enjoy.

632
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,410
I will be able to enjoy it if it tastes good...

633
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:12,990
I'm a good cook. Have lots of good fortune in the new year, both of you.

634
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:15,940
You get lots of blessings, too.

635
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:19,490
I broke up with Sunny.

636
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:21,640
What did she say when you broke up?

637
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,320
She said, "I'll just get dumped."

638
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,220
What she means is, since I got dumped, you call me first.

639
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:30,380
That's what that means.

640
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:32,580
She asked about my identity.

641
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,590
That's a tough one.

642
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:40,120
But grim reaper is a little bit negative, so how about you say you're an angel?

643
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,180
It's the same genre.

644
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:45,950
Be strong. Fighting.

645
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:51,790
That's how everyone grows up. At age 300, it's the toughest time.

646
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,750
It's okay.

647
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,920
- What?<br>- One truth, again.

648
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,660
In order to earn the answer, go near the one who is close to the answer.

649
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,050
What are you talking about?

650
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,940
What is this? Let go.

651
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:12,710
Indeed, I see nothing from you. Just warmth.

652
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:15,680
My fingers. It hurts.

653
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,310
Hey, what are you going to do about my hand?

654
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,480
Thanks for the rice cake soup.

655
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,540
My hand. What about my hand?

656
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,590
My hand. Filthy.

657
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:25,720
Filthy. I need to cut it off.

658
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,680
Disinfection. That should do, right?

659
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:38,680
It's good.

660
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:43,710
It's all disinfected. I'm fine now. Don't worry.

661
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:48,120
So pay me back for the rice cake soup, okay?

662
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,930
Why are we coming here? You said to go to the supermarket.

663
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,520
That's roasted sweet potatoes!

664
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:59,770
This is seriously the first time I'm eating roasted sweet <br>potatoes. Seriously, really, for real the first time.

665
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:04,930
It's not that you're eating roasted sweet potatoes for the first time, but the first time you're acting as if you're eating them for the first time.

666
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:12,800
Oh my world. Indeed it's such a small world we live in nowadays.

667
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,140
How could a coincidence like this happen, right?

668
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,150
What are you doing? Before such a coincidence?

669
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,500
You two aren't going to say hi?

670
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,040
We agreed not to say hi even if we meet by coincidence.

671
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,280
You agreed not to say hi?

672
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:40,000
You two, the overall look is like yolk and white.

673
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,920
Fried egg.

674
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:48,450
Sorry.

675
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:57,360
Bean sprouts. The string and the head.

676
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,550
You like bean sprouts.

677
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,280
You ruined everything. Everything.

678
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,810
No, their outfits...

679
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:16,650
Sorry. I shouldn't have included this Mister in our strategy.

680
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:23,320
It's okay. At least I got to see Sunny.

681
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:35,120
Also, you don't even have $5, so why insist on eating roasted sweet potatoes?

682
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:39,990
I mean, what are we supposed to do when the two of you<br> who look normal don't even have $5 together?

683
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:41,270
Just when you think you know.

684
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,360
My boss paid for this. What are you going to do about it?

685
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,720
$5 was a variable I didn't think of.

686
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,020
- Next time, I will for sure have cash in advance. <br>- Never mind.

687
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:53,990
Today, our plan failed without any gains thanks to you.

688
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:57,080
Uh-uh, the plan failed but we did gain something.

689
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,600
Look at this man.

690
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:06,520
I'm going to work.

691
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:14,480
My concept today was... an angel.

692
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:18,740
It's all your fault then.

693
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,930
Oh my god!

694
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,640
<i>CEO, over here. </i>

695
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,100
<i>I'm totally natural, right? I don't look like an illegal resident, right? </i>

696
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,620
<i>I don't look like someone who came abroad for the first time, right? </i>

697
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:23,400
So in the end, she bought that?

698
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,690
To meet with that CEO or whatever.

699
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,080
So I was supposed to buy that for her.

700
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,250
She said she was the one who got dumped.

701
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:27,220
But why do I keep feeling like I got dumped. I don't know.

702
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:30,480
Each person has a different time frame for healing from

703
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,950
wounded feelings from a breakup.

704
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:39,680
Instead of focusing on recovering quickly, focus on where you can recover.

705
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,900
Focus.

706
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:46,350
Thank you for the consultation, Doctor.

707
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:51,100
Have some tea. It will erase your memory of this life.

708
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:55,300
Such a waste on my studies.

709
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:59,310
Why did I bother getting a medical degree and throw away my youth?

710
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:02,360
You were my last patient.

711
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,530
Thank you for making the time for me.

712
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:25,060
I'm here, My Lord. Are you on your way back from somewhere?

713
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,790
I just had something to buy briefly.

714
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:33,220
I can't sleep and I was feeling lonesome so I thought I could come and play a round of Go.

715
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:39,580
The candlesticks and the tableware, I'll set a day to get them cleaned.

716
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:43,350
I'll do it when the weather's good, so don't worry.

717
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:47,790
Then, shall we play a round of Go we haven't played for so long?

718
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:56,750
When you were young, I was the one who taught you Go but lately, I keep losing to you.

719
01:08:56,750 --> 01:09:00,510
Because I play it like it's life or death.

720
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:04,460
And I don't?

721
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:11,860
It's a horse surrounded, My Lord. I'm not giving it back to you no matter what.

722
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,930
Let's see...

723
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:43,890
<i>Live alone in immortality and watch the deaths of your beloved ones. </i>

724
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:47,570
<i>You shall not forget any death. </i>

725
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:53,460
Are you going somewhere nice, Mr. Chairman?

726
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:57,750
Yes, I think I might be.

727
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,440
Day drinking is always nice.

728
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,290
Day drinking is cold now.

729
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,190
Did something happen?

730
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:27,460
A namecard will come.

731
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,560
Ji Eun Tak's namecard?

732
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,070
No. Chairman Yoo.

733
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:40,200
Did you tell Chairman Yoo?

734
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,920
Is there anything to gain from a human knowing their own death?

735
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,760
Then what about Deok Hwa? It'd be better if he knew no matter what.

736
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,780
So he can have no regret. Isn't it better to tell him?

737
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:55,190
Before death, everything is a regret.

738
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:06,480
Chairman Yoo asked about your well-being. Asking if the visiting friend is doing well.

739
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,610
I guess he is just asking when he knows it all already.

740
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:13,320
About what? That you got dumped?

741
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,200
Did you try to call her?

742
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:22,040
No. If I do, I think I really need to make a coming out.

743
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:27,430
You look so obviously like a grim reaper. Maybe she's slow.

744
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,790
Is that it?

745
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:37,050
- What? <br>- What you sense from Sunny.

746
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:38,700
There's more, of course.

747
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:42,260
- There is? <br>- I sensed that that woman has a name that is too great for her.

748
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,100
To have the same name as my sister?

749
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:49,520
It's a relief that you guys broke up. I disliked so many things about her every time I met her.

750
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,400
And she has no sense of logic at all.

751
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:58,430
I think you should stop criticizing Sunny.

752
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:00,840
You're taking her side?

753
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:06,160
There's something I didn't tell you. That I saw Sunny's past life.

754
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:06,990
You said it was a secret.

755
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,700
Sunny seems to be a reincarnation of your younger sister.

756
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,310
Sunny is? Not you?

757
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:20,380
Sunny's face in a previous life is the same as the face of the woman in the portrait

758
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,700
you have.

759
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,920
You're sure of it?

760
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,500
What did you see?

761
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:39,900
The woman I saw was standing in a spot in a palace.

762
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:44,730
She was wearing white and her ranking seemed high.

763
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:53,040
She was shot in the chest by an arrow and she collapsed while bleeding.

764
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:00,070
I told you that.

765
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:06,680
Maybe not the white clothes, but the arrow... I don't think I said that.

766
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:10,410
What else? Did you see anything else?

767
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:16,480
She was riding in a palanquin<br> and saw someone and smiled, through a small window.

768
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,340
She smiles as she asks,

769
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:22,190
- "Am I..."<br>- <i>"Am I pretty today?"</i>

770
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,760
A voice answered her.

771
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,170
- "You're ugly." <br>- "You're ugly."

772
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:47,830
Your younger sister...

773
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:50,010
Is it really her?

774
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:53,770
It's her.
