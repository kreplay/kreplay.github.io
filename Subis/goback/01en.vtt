74
303
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,390

80

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,880

81
331
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,000
You're bragging about everything when you don't even amount to gum.

83

84

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,950
- Ah, my muscle spasm... 
 - Aigoo...

85
348
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,790
Okay. Fine, cheapskate. I acknowledge. I also acknowledge that I make only a measly amount.

86
352
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,630
So, just put that down. Then we'll talk.

87
356
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,490
So pathetic. Is this some kind of treasure?

88
360
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,900
Of course! The food you eat, the clothes you're wearing,

89
364
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,150
and each and every one of the baby's diapers are from that.

90
368
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,550

Yes, well.

Do they think marketing employees are their own underlings?

129

He's all over the place believing in his wife's family.

Natural Farm? I haven't heard that in such a long time.

614
2505
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,170
They didn't change it yet?

615
2509

I know! I know. Everland. It changed three years ago

 Wow, she's nice looking.

What are you doing?

629
2566
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:58,650
There's Suzy in here. Dreamy first love.

630
2570
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:02,410
Why do all the first love's face all look like this?

631
2574
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:07,390
It's always like that. So pure and fragile... Hey!

632
2578
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:11,440
Don't you remember my first love from college? Min Seo Yeong in dance department.

633
2582
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:14,260
She was pretty.

634
2586
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:19,570
I should've gone after her, but I was such a shy fool then.

635
2590
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,800
Not shy. You were just plain ignorant.

636
2594
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,940
Even if you go back in time, you won't be able to seduce Min Seo Yeong.

637
2598
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:30,560
If I go back, I should seduce her. Why would I date someone like Ma Jin Joo?

638
2602
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:38,110
Look at this! Isn't he so cute? He's no joke.

639
2606
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,720
He says "Daddy" these days. He's speaking words really early on.

640
2610
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,600
In the old days your personality was just as crazy. You're dead.

641
2614
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,760
Could he be a genius? Hey, that gifted school. Is it expensive?

642
2618
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,380
Run Suzy!
