Well, I have the right to be curious about how she's doing.

Hey, hey! How can there be someone with no first love? Your first love is me.

43
174
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,630
Why are you deciding who my first love is? That's what I decide.

44

What's the standard for first love?

45

Is your first love the person you first date? Kiss?

46
186

Then, your first love isn't Seo Young. It's me.

47
190
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,470
No, that's not it. Someone who makes your heart flutter just by looking at him/her.

48
194
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,580
It's when you get excited just thinking of them.

49
198
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,850
That's unrequited love, not first love.

50
202

My heart never fluttered nor was I ever excited by looking at you.

So I can't even come home or call home.

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,430
Then, that's it.

158
639
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,530
You read it again?

159
643
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,290
I did it without her noticing. How did she find out?

160
647
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,320
She's already grown up. Why do you do it?

161
651
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,620
You're so strange!

162
655
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,010
I'm worried. What if she runs into all these weird guys now that she's an adult?

163
659
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,910
She's a grown adult. She should be able to meet weird guys and nice guys.

164
663
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,860
No. She's my daughter. How could she just meet any guy?

165
667
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,710
Do you know how scary this world is today?

166
671
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,130
And also, guys are all really rotten anyway.

167
675
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,520
Yeah. They are.

168
679
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,290
Whoever it may be I'll make sure they'll be at least 10 auditions. I will.

169
683
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,370
I guess my daughters can't get married then.

170
687
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,210
Then, I'm going to spend forever with them by my side.

171
691
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,100
My children.

172
695
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,500
<i> My children.</i>

173
699
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:12,670
♫  <i> I can't go back, it's irrevocable. ♫</i>

174
703
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:18,870
♫  <i> We felt like a dream. ♫</i>

175
707
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:28,090
♫ <i>The farther we are apart, the more I feel closer to you</i> ♫

176
711
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:34,370
♫  <i> Is it my feelings for you? ♫</i>

177
715
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:42,540
♫  <i> It feels like I'm dreaming. ♫</i>

178
719
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:50,230
♫  <i> If I could turn back time... ♫</i>

179
723
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,960
You should've come out of your room if you're awake. Why are you sitting?

180
727
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,230
- What's wrong? 
 - It's nothing.

181
732
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,800
Nothing? You cried.

182
736
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,460
I had a strange dream.

183
740
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,110
Really?

184
744
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,080
You've been acting strange lately.

185
748
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,250
Not only do you dream that I died.

186
752
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,040
Should I prescribe you some tonic?

187
756
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,970
What's wrong?

188
760
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,580
Mom.

189
764
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,060
My mom. My mom is so great.

190
768
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,080
You're really strange.

191
772
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,590
A grown lady like yourself is clinging to me.

192
776
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,350
You're going to school already?

193
780
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,560
No. Take me with you guys.

194
784
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,500
She's gotten her dialysis done consistently for the past five years.

195
788
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,240
There aren't any other problems.

196
792
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,800
No, but. I know she's okay now, but...

197
796
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,700
If she keeps getting dialysis, around ten years later

198
800
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,020
won't she get a lot of complications.

199
804
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,940
The complications can come tomorrow or ten years from now.

200
808
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,740
There's no way that we can put off her dialysis because of that fear.

201
812
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,240
Still, is there anything to reduce her complications?

202
816
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,180
She's already doing all she can to reduce complications.

203
820
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,860
Your mom can live long.

204
824
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,480
Don't worry about it too much.

205
828
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,750
By whose standards will she live long?

206
832
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,300
It's only ten years.

207
836
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,790
Her children studied a lot because of their mom.

208
840
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,080
She even knows about complications.

209
844
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,250
Her son came yesterday.

210
848
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,950
Patient Go Eun Sook doesn't have a son.

211
852
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,800
- She only has two daughters. 
 - What?

212
857
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,180
Choi Ban Do, get up!

213
861
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,320
Get up already!

214
865
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,310
What, you were awake?

215
869
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,210
Good morning, Mom. Did you sleep well?

216
873
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,370
Dad. I'm not taking it.

217
877
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,230
Not everyone can become rich.

218
881
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,440
If you continue to have such a miserly heart

219
885
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,590
you kid, where did you memorize such sly words, you really!

220
889
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,130
You used to be so hard to wake up.

221
893
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,320
What's up with you these days?

222
897
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:27,230
- Is that cabbage extract?
- Take some even if you hate it. Do you know how good it is for you?

223
902
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,610
Tastes like a rag.

224
906
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,310
Even if it tastes like this, it's great for digestion.

225
910
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,070
Thanks for the drink. I'll be going.

226
914
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,210
He used to not take it even if I beat him to a pulp.

227
918
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,980
What's up with him today?

228
922
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,520
Building 31, please.

229
926
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,840
We're here.

230
930
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,520
Match your footsteps!

231
934
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,650
Left, left, left

232
938
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,500
-You must be doing morning exercise? 
 -Yes.

233
943
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,310
There's nothing difficult going on at school?

234
947
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,360
If you ever need anything, just tell me. I'll give you anything.

235
951
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,640
Put in a good word for me to your father.

236
955
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,500
Then, I don't even want to come out to school so

237
959
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,520
can you just say I went to school and give me a graduation certificate?

238
963
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,280
If it's to this degree, I would like some scholarship money as well.

239
967
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,240
I have a meeting.

240
971
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,420
Student Jong Ryul!

241
975
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,990
Isn't that the school president?

242
979
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,350
See? Something is up.

243
983
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,580
If it's not a chaebol, it's a politician.

244
987
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,280
Who's whispering during PT?

245
991
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,700
Ah! That scared me.

246
995
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,370
What the...

247
999
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,760
Go away.

248
1003
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,320
Wait.

249
1007
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,010
The food will taste bad if you eat alone.

250
1011
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,790
I'm not alone.

251
1015
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,100
How can the lunch come out dead last?

252
1019
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,470
Not you, me.

253
1023
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,770
<i> What's up with him? He told me not to flirt.</i>

254
1027
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,270
I can't tell how to act at all.

255
1031
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,030
<i> What's this?</i>

256
1035
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,760
Senior. You must be having a hard time because of Jin Joo.

257
1039
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,640
It's her first time receiving a confession.

258
1043
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,870
She's so country bumpkin-like.

259
1047
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,820
- No, it's not that.
  - What?

260
1052
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,900
It wasn't a confession.

261
1056
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,270
It wasn't a confession.

262
1060
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,040
I'm in the midst of seducing her.

263
1064
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,880
You're all done right?

264
1068
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,740
What are you doing? Follow me.

265
1072
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,230
You should go.

266
1076
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,690
Just go quickly.

267
1080
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,110
That senior like Jin Joo, right?

268
1084
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,950
You think so too right? He said he's trying to seduce her.

269
1088
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,880
Then, he'll like her no matter her situation right?

270
1092
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,540
Even if she's a divorcee or has a child.

271
1096
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,890
What's so extreme.

272
1100
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:47,830
Even if it's a time of great trial and difficulty (youth), I can't tell what he's thinking!

273
1104
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:54,870
You told me not to flirt, and it wasn't a confession. But, you're seducing me?

274
1108
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,600
Me?

275
1112
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,120
Not me, but you. You're in the process of seducing me.

276
1116
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,280
What? Me? Since when did I seduce you?

277
1120
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,170
You tried. In the last few days. And with much eagerness.

278
1124
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,030
Wow.

279
1128
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:17,470
Even if someone has tried to seduce me, I have never tried to seduce anyone.

280
1132
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,370
At the main gate, that was an accident. The administrative offices

281
1136
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,630
That was an accident.

282
1140
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,390
Oh, right. Is your leg okay?

283
1144
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,810
By any chance, does it hurt?

284
1148
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,910
You'll have to continue to ice it for it to heal properly.

285
1152
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,650
A place that's once fractured, if you don't take care of it, it'll last a lifetime.

286
1156
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,500
See? You're seducing me.

287
1160
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,220
Why do you keep saying that?

288
1164
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,130
This is what you call seduction.

289
1168
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,940
What?

290
1172
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,270
Since it's your fault as well.

291
1176
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,390
You don't look like you're hurting to the extent where you need someone taking care of you...

292
1180
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,940
It's that I don't make a fuss. Every time I walk it's a tearing pain.

293
1184
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,170
Oh, really?

294
1188
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:13,170
Hey, hey! What kind of girl

295
1192
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,320
touches someone without the proper procedures?

296
1196
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,010
Why is he like that?

297
1200
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,910
What are you listening to?

298
1204
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,330
Ah! You scared me.

299
1208
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,070
What?

300
1212
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,090
Why?

301
1216
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,400
It's cool.

302
1220
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,200
What the.

303
1224
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,140
No, no. For reals.

304
1228
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,420
A ballerina listening to hip hop. That's very cool.

305
1232
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,080
I thought you would listen to classical music since you do ballet.

306
1236
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,780
I see you like this type of music.

307
1240
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,020
It's fun, right?

308
1244
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,330
Yo. Yo.

309
1248
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:05,930
There's a bounce to the beat in hip-hop. It's different from the sleep-inducing classical music.

310
1252
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,040
Won't it be really fun to dance to hip hop?

311
1256
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,740
Then do it.

312
1260
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,550
I can't dance that kind of dance.

313
1264
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,410
Ballet. Ballet is a type of dance.

314
1268
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,400
Can you not do ballet to hip hop?

315
1272
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,410
Of course you can't. How can you do ballet to hip hop?

316
1276
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:28,150
Really?

317
1280
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,160
We haven't known each other for a long time.

318
1284
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,440
Exactly. That's why I need to find out.

319
1288
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,960
Find out what?

320
1292
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,610
Things I didn't know about you before. And things I didn't know about me in the past, too.

321
1296
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:49,490
I don't remember being rejected...

322
1300
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,400
But why is it that I gave up without even confessing?

323
1304
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,600
Fold what? Cranes? Turtles?

324
1308
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,120
What cranes? Nowadays it's roses that are in.

325
1312
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,340
What's that rag on your head?

326
1316
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,690
What rag! You don't know HOT's doorag? You country bumpkin!

327
1320
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,470
What a liar. You put it on so that no one recognizes you for getting your head stuck in the main gate.

328
1324
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,100
Whose fault is that?

329
1328
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,940
It's too bitter, I can't drink it.

330
1332
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,410
Ok. Herbal drink!

331
1336
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:37,390
He kissed Yoon Bo Reum and hasn't cleaned his teeth ever since.

332
1340
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,030
Ew. You're disgusting.

333
1344
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,050
You're dating Yoon Bo Reum?

334
1348
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,970
Why are you so surprised?

335
1352
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,520
Because of Yoon Bo Reum, my life...

336
1356
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,320
I'm going to curse her.

337
1360
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,490
I wish she went to Hell.

338
1364
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,710
I'm so pitiful!

339
1368
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:04,350
I'm so pitiful.

340
1372
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,710
Why is it that this kid continues to live his sad life?

341
1376
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,380
Dating? That's BS.

342
1380
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,680
Yoon Bo Reum probably gave you a peck, not a kiss.

343
1384
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,390
That's the same thing.

344
1388
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,140
How are they the same? It's a peck, not a kiss.

345
1392
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,770
You give someone a peck when you meet them and say goodbye.

346
1396
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,440
I do it with my cousin all the time. Am I dating her?

347
1400
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,820
You peck someone because you're dating them. Why would you peck someone you're not dating?

348
1404
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:40,870
There's kids like that too. Abroad that's a greeting you know.

349
1408
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,060
I didn't think Yoon Bo Reum was like that, but wow sh'es really free with her touch.

350
1412
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,430
So liberal in all directions. Great Yoon Bo Reum!

351
1416
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,420
Again.

352
1420
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,150
<i> There's no way she would kiss me if we weren't dating.</i>

353
1424
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,190
But I'm still a man.

354
1428
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,360
Dang.

355
1432
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,860
I thought you would leave, but you came.

356
1436
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,560
What the? Is this all?

357
1440
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,340
Hold me right there.

358
1444
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,630
1.2.3.4.

359
1448
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,860
Carry me like this please.

360
1452
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,030
Yeah.

361
1456
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,630
There's kids like that too sometimes.

362
1460
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:35,310
Yoon Bo Reum is no ordinary girl.

363
1464
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,820
Skinship is natural for her.

364
1468
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,640
Okay.

365
1472
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,260
Give me your bag. You follow me around just to carry that.

366
1476
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,730
Just that? It's so expensive!

367
1480
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,790
I spent all night making these.

368
1484
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,910
It's delicious. You should have some.

369
1488
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,230
What a good time to be alive.

370
1492
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:19,340
If you spent all night, you should eat it.

371
1496
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,110
I picked this up from the garbage. It tastes gross. You should have it.

372
1500
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:44,130
Then, will you eat it? I mean, she spent all night excitedly making that. And you still won't take it?

373
1504
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,730
What happens after I take it? There isn't anything free in this world.

374
1508
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,170
It's give and take. If I take something, I need to give something.

375
1512
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,870
Why should I make a tiresome deal with someone I don't even care about?

376
1516
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,400
Would she have given you that expecting something back?

377
1520
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,950
She just liked you and wanted to do something for you, like feeding you. Like a parent's love.

378
1524
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,370
It's like that.

379
1528
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,480
How pretty.

380
1532
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,430
Do you think parents don't expect anything from you?

381
1536
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:16,100
What's up with this kid? He's so strange.

382
1540
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,040
- Give me it. 
 - What?

383
1545
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,530
You told me to eat it. Isn't it because you want to do anything for me and feed me?

384
1549
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,900
No, that's not me.

385
1553
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,540
Let's meet each other at 7 pm over there. I can't drive you know.

386
1557
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,970
You should take this.

387
1561
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,080
Just give it to me later.

388
1565
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,570
Your leg looks fine!

389
1569
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,810
What is this? Is he really hurt or no?

390
1573
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,110
With this, you won't get kicked out?

391
1577
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,870
They're saying I should work off my penalty points by volunteering.

392
1581
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,500
Ahn Jae Woo, that traitor.

393
1585
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,580
You're here?

394
1589
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,670
Here it is.

395
1593
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,520
Number 85.

396
1597
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,450
Why's that young thing so manly?

397
1601
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:28,540
He's older than you. He's famous. The most handsome in Hankuk University.

398
1605
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,780
His height, his face, his fit in clothes.

399
1609
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,200
There's a rumor he's the grandson of a large corporation owner.

400
1613
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,980
Really?

401
1617
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,870
He might be the son of the Minister of Defense.

402
1621
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,390
- Oh.
- But the way I see it, there's something to it.

403
1626
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,460
He's an eomchinah huh?

404
1630
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,640
What? He hit what?

405
1634
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,290
An eomchinah man. The son of a mother's friend.

406
1638
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,110
He's your mom's friend's son?

407
1642
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,420
It's nothing.

408
1646
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,260
Hey, can you put these in the changing room?

409
1650
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,330
The women's right?

410
1654
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,540
You're crazy. Just leave it.

411
1658
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,330
It's Ma Jin Joo from the history department.

412
1662
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,310
What are you going to do when Ye Dam finds out? You worked so hard on getting her to fall for you.

413
1666
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,310
Do you think I would? I just play with her.

414
1670
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,200
Just look at her. She looks great.

415
1674
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,600
But has no money you know?

416
1678
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,800
She's perfect to play around with.

417
1682
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,780
Also Yeorim's my lifetime supply of money. Do you think I'd loose her?

418
1686
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,940
He's such a piece of work.

419
1690
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,830
<i> (Entrance to Shower Stalls)</i>

420
1694
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,820
- What is this? 
 - Oh!

421
1699
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,610
Oh, I'm so sorry! I thought you were my friend.

422
1703
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,290
You pushed me so hard.

423
1707
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,090
I'm sorry!

424
1711
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,520
Seo Young, I'm so sorry. What a waste of a ticket.

425
1715
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,330
It's okay. I'll just watch it by myself. You can go.

426
1719
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,490
- Sorry. 
 - It's okay, you can  go.

427
1724
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,700
- Okay, bye! 
 - Bye.

428
1729
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,760
Try it. Can't you do ballet to hip hop music?

429
1733
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,090
Yeah yeah

430
1737
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,770
1997. Uptown boys in full effect

431
1741
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,100
wikified always g-dafied

432
1745
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,500
Meet me again! Meet again!

433
1749
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,850
Forgive my shortcomings in the past.

434
1753
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:46,230
Meet me again. I hope that you'll meet me again

435
1757
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,840
Whose waiting for you, baby.

436
1761
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,370
Don't walk away, love me baby.

437
1765
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,470
I got you on my mind, I can't let you go.

438
1769
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,160
don't walk away. Stay here with me.

439
1773
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,300
I got you on my mind, I can't let you go.

440
1777
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,130
I wanted to meet a new girl.

441
1781
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:16,990
That's why I told you let's separate.

442
1785
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:21,460
Because of my simplemindness, I let you go

443
1789
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,940
wordlessly without time to regret.

444
1793
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:32,040
But still I need only you.

445
1797
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,050
Hey, it worked out. Why'd you stop?

446
1801
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,120
It didn't really work. I was just doing it for fun.

447
1805
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,020
You should do it for work. Then later it becomes fun work.

448
1809
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,430
What?

449
1813
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:50,270
When you live life, it's hard to find what you like to do.

450
1817
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,920
It's hard to find something you have to do that's the same as what you want to do.

451
1821
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,940
When that doesn't work, you make it that way.

452
1825
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,470
If you put all your eggs in one basket, then when that basket is gone, there's nothing else you can do.

453
1829
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,930
If it's something fun to do, the fun is what lasts.

454
1833
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,830
Your words flow like a poet.

455
1837
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,220
It's true.

456
1841
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,550
Later what if you get injured and can't anymore?

457
1845
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,230
There's nothing that's forever.

458
1849
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,850
So, just do what you want from time to time.

459
1853
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,410
Is that true?

460
1857
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,590
With that in mind, what do you want to do right now?

461
1861
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,940
Here you go.

462
1865
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,840
Why are you giving me it already? Just follow me.

463
1869
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,930
You lied, then! You don't even look hurt.

464
1873
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,270
Your leg looks fine.

465
1877
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,180
I'm going to the hospital right now.

466
1881
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,230
The hospital? Oh, I'm sorry.

467
1885
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,560
You should give me your bag, then. I can hold it.

468
1889
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,350
I'm stronger than you think.

469
1893
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,100
It must really hurt.

470
1897
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,140
Is it true? You're really going to watch a movie with me?

471
1901
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,370
Well, my friends canceled on me, so..

472
1905
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,570
This is my third time telling you this.

473
1909
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,170
What?

474
1913
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,830
<i>Ugh!</i>

475
1917
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,450
Geez!

476
1921
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,530
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah..

477
1926
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,590
♫  <i> I'm falling in love with you.. ♫</i>

478
1930
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,550
♫  <i> I don't want to hide it anymore. ♫</i>

479
1934
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,550
Hold onto me.

480
1938
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,410
♫  <i> Let's always walk together. ♫</i>

481
1942
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:53,440
If you fall, only you'll be in the loss.

482
1946
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,230
♫  <i> I'll come one step closer... ♫</i>

483
1950
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:04,440
♫  <i> Like that, I keep smiling. ♫</i>

484
1954
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:12,900
I'll walk slowly, awkward in love.

485
1958
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,330
<i> Would you look at my veins!</i>

486
1962
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:21,900
<i> Yes, Choi Ban Do. This is manly.</i>

487
1966
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,470
This is the theater?

488
1970
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:34,030
It has to be here, right?

489
1974
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,800
It would only be here, right?

490
1978
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,060
Yeah. Because it was reserved for here.

491
1982
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,980
<i> No way... It's a big theater. Would I bump into them?</i>

492
1986
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,810
That'll be ₩3000.

493
1990
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,320
Ah, okay.

494
1994
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,250
What!

495
1998
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,840
I have to go to the bathroom.

496
2002
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,160
Here it is.

497
2006
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,000
Why does it have to be here? I'm screwed.

498
2010
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,550
No, that's not it. Did I commit a sin? It's not like I'm cheating.

499
2014
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,630
Okay, Choi Ban Do. Be confident!

500
2018
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,040
Straighten your shoulders! Yeah! Let's go!

501
2022
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:55,450
It's not like I committed a sin.

502
2026
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,640
Okay, then.

503
2030
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,010
What is this? Why is she here?

504
2034
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,820
The mother's friend's kid?

505
2038
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,660
Did you do something wrong? What happened?

506
2042
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,930
You said you were going to the hospital. Why come here?

507
2046
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:29,270
I thought it'd be better if I saw a movie with someone.

508
2050
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,040
Look. I knew you were faking it.

509
2054
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,750
This shouldn't be happening.

510
2058
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,280
Sorry, sorry. I had to use the bathroom. It was urgent.

511
2062
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,230
Ooh, it's so good!

512
2066
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:49,580
Oh, right.  Remember when you confessed to me?

513
2070
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,660
That wasn't a confess-

514
2074
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,010
Oh, yeah. When you asked me to date you.

515
2078
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,330
Yeah.

516
2082
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,980
It's been some time right?

517
2086
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,680
Your first love is me.

518
2090
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,170
I don't have a first love, but I was a first love to someone.

519
2094
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,940
- To who?
  - You don't believe me?

520
2099
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,850
An upperclassman who was a history major. He's really hot and rich. Handsome too.

521
2103
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,420
I got a confession from him.

522
2107
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,460
Really? This woman... you've watched so many K-dramas you're making things up now.

523
2111
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,220
Are you writing a drama? Why would a guy whose handsome, rich, and tall like you? Did he got shot?

524
2115
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,120
It's true!

525
2119
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,380
This ajumma's got bipolar doesn't she.

526
2123
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,820
It's you. The one who got shot. The mother's friend's son.

527
2127
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,280
What? Did he get shot like ten times??

528
2131
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,230
Okay. It's better that she remained as his first love.

529
2135
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,650
You haven't seen it, right?

530
2139
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:46,790
Huh? Yeah. I haven't seen it.

531
2143
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:52,490
I wonder how fun it is. I've heard it's really sad that people cry.

532
2147
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:56,060
Well it'll probably be an obvious melodrama.

533
2151
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,730
Who would cry at that?

534
2155
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,140
1999 In Reality

535
2159
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,940
<i> Hey, don't do it!</i>

536
2163
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,280
The year 2004

537
2167
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,840
The year 2017

538
2171
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,030
<i> No!!</i>

539
2175
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:40,890
Now that I think about it, it's been a while since I came here. I came here often in my college days.

540
2179
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,880
You're still a college student. A freshman, too.

541
2183
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,690
From time to time, you talk like an old man.

542
2187
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,440
I'm not an old man.

543
2191
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,790
No, I like it. It's comfortable.

544
2195
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,600
Oh, you like it?

545
2199
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,550
You're not crying.

546
2203
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,340
We worked hard today.

547
2207
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,330
Do guys normally dislike it if a girl kisses them first?

548
2211
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:59,610
No! Boys love it! They're so thankful!

549
2215
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,980
Hey, can you introduce me to her?

550
2219
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,820
Hey, me first.

551
2223
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,360
Then, what is he?

552
2227
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,990
What if the girl asks him to date her first?

553
2231
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:12,280
The girl first? Hey, that's a little..

554
2235
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,400
What? Why does it matter who asks first?

555
2239
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,140
Still, a man has his honor.

556
2243
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,800
The girl should give the boy the chance for him to ask her to date him. Right?

557
2247
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,020
Hey, guys. Have a drink!

558
2251
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,670
Come fast! Why are you so late?

559
2255
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,930
We started already. Come fast.

560
2259
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,530
Quickly, quickly.

561
2263
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:36,730
To boys, his first love lasts forever.

562
2267
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,050
When did you have your first love?

563
2271
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:42,030
During middle school. I liked a girl from my church.

564
2275
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:46,620
- What about you, Jae Woo? 
 - Me?

565
2280
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:55,180
Me? In preschool. I got so nervous and all that.

566
2284
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,830
Seriously?

567
2288
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:58,890
They say a fair face may hide a foul heart.

568
2292
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:01,820
I'm a bit mature, you know...

569
2296
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,550
That's unrequited love you idiots. Did you go out with them?

570
2300
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,870
No, how can I go out with my ethics teacher...

571
2304
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,560
She didn't even know me.

572
2308
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,920
Why is it first love? It's unrequited love.

573
2312
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,900
I think you guys are mistaken. Your first love isn't the person you first like.

574
2316
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:26,660
It's the first person you date. Men and women need to date for it to be love.

575
2320
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:32,740
It needs to be both ways. If not it's just an one-sided love.

576
2324
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,570
Unrequited love!

577
2328
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,240
No, that's not it. It's first love to me.

578
2332
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,870
My heart still beats for her.

579
2336
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,980
If we aren't even dating, why'd she kiss me?

580
2340
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,000
Why is it hard to ask someone to date them?

581
2344
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,650
Waiting like this will give me cancer.

582
2348
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:22,220
Ahn Jae Woo. If you walk one more step, we're over.

583
2352
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,500
Did we even start anything?

584
2356
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,870
We didn't even date. There's nothing to end, it was unrequited love.

585
2360
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:37,220
What?

586
2364
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:42,820
Sure, you could kiss someone you aren't dating. But, it's not like that for me.

587
2368
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,110
Why would you kiss someone you aren't even dating?

588
2372
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:49,030
It could be nothing to you, but for me

589
2376
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,230
- You're my first love.  
 - Ha.

590
2381
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:58,400
You said your first love was from preschool. You said you got so nervous!

591
2385
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,840
How would I remember that? And, you're the one who said that if you're not dating someone, it's unrequited love.

592
2389
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,250
Yeah. So I guess it must be unrequited love.

593
2393
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:07,170
No, you're my first love!

594
2397
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,830
Then, what do you want to do with me?

595
2401
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:13,790
What?

596
2405
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,730
What do you want to do with me?

597
2409
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:26,620
I want to date you. Not unrequited love. Dating.

598
2413
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,510
You said it, okay? You asked me to date you.

599
2417
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,110
You didn't cry.

600
2421
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,590
How sad was that love story for me to cry?

601
2425
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:52,830
There's a lot of things in life to cry about otherwise.

602
2429
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,580
Did you cry?

603
2433
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,930
Excuse me.

604
2437
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,390
Hello, Father-in--

605
2441
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,140
Who are you?

606
2445
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,700
A passerby.

607
2449
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,610
Oh, my.

608
2453
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,320
He's an upperclassman who's a history major. Just an upperclassman.

609
2457
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,240
He's my dad.

610
2461
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,340
Hello, I'm Jung Nam Gil.

611
2465
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,610
Give me it now.

612
2469
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,680
Uh.. I hurt my leg, so..

613
2473
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,070
Don't imagine anything weird. He's just an upperclassman.

614
2477
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,380
An upperclassman. Nice to meet you.

615
2481
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,720
Jin Joo. Dad's leaving now. You want to come?

616
2485
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,870
No. You can go first.

617
2489
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:58,400
Okay. Then, have fun.

618
2493
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,570
You want to spend more time with me?

619
2497
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:09,270
How can you just get cured with just one diagnosis from Dr. Han Seok Gyu (actor han seok gyu played a doctor in a movie that was popular back then, and he was the lead again in this movie they both saw)?

620
2501
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:14,240
Then, I'm going to take it that you're not hurting anymore.

621
2505
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,370
Ma Jin Joo.

622
2509
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,660
I picked something up, so I was going to the police station. Won't you come with me?

623
2513
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,290
What was that earlier?

624
2517
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,760
What?

625
2521
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,010
Oh, I thought he was someone I knew.

626
2525
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:42,960
Oh, he was a father-in-law?

627
2529
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,720
What? A master of furniture?

628
2533
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,430
A leather master? What kind of master (sounds similar)?

629
2537
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:52,090
Yeah, he's a father-in-law, but... What kind he is... Uh..

630
2541
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,930
Wow!

631
2545
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,590
Anyone who wants to have fun with us can come out!

632
2549
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,640
She's here!

633
2553
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:58,040
It's ballet!

634
2557
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:28,470
♫ <i> When we first met, it was a bit awkward. ♫</i>

635
2561
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,400
♫ <i> A bit awkward. ♫</i>

636
2565
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,050
Your smiling eyes

637
2569
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,190
It works! Ballet to hip hop music.

638
2573
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:38,920
I think it works because they did it with me. Right?

639
2577
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,790
Was it fun?

640
2581
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,560
Yeah. So fun1

641
2585
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,540
I did the right thing by pushing you, right?

642
2589
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,030
It's fate.

643
2593
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:51,720
Yeah. Sure it's fate. How we watched a movie, too.

644
2597
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,050
I'm quite confident practice really makes perfect.

645
2601
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:59,640
♫ <i> I wanted to say this to you. ♫</i>

646
2605
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,430
You were surprising.

♫  <i> put you in my heart. ♫</i>

650
2621
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:18,060
♫  <i> Your lovely voice ♫</i>

651
2625
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,080
♫  <i> as if a rain,  ♫</i>

652
2629
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,960
♫  <i> I want to be drenched in you. ♫</i>

653
2633
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,830
I lost it in a taxi.

654
2637
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:36,910
I picked it up in the school's parking lot.

655
2641
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:54,290
But how did you know it was mine? It's not like there was any id.

656
2645
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,860
I asked other students.

657
2649
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,740
But is that how you should act towards someone who found you something?

658
2653
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:07,000
Well... Thank you.

659
2657
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:13,140
So I'll buy this. But the fractured leg, no matter how I think of it is a lie.

660
2661
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,920
You must care a lot about whether my leg hurts or not.

661
2665
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,930
Because if it's true, I'll feel sorry.

662
2669
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:21,880
It's worrying! I don't want to hurt someone else's precious child.

663
2673
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,850
You look rich. If you were hurt, you could've gone to the hospital.

664
2677
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,580
Me? Where?

665
2681
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,550
Do you not look in the mirror?

666
2685
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,840
From head to toe, you're wearing luxurious clothes. And that watch.

667
2689
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,670
The car too. You're surrounded by money.

668
2693
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,930
Nice catch.

669
2697
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:44,820
But even if I put on these things, they don't really know.

670
2701
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,000
Are you a materialistic girl?

671
2705
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,600
No, well not...Don't most...

672
2709
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,510
Kids these days could probably be unaware.

673
2713
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:14,160
Strange.

674
2717
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,930
Are you a split personality or something?

675
2721
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:24,670
Or are your lachrymal glands broken that you keep crying or something?

676
2725
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:29,370
What are you saying?

677
2729
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:38,180
♫ <i>  I'm thinking in love... ♫</i>

678
2733
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:43,570
<i> What's he doing? I feel like I'm under pressure.</i>

679
2737
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,820
Uh..

680
2741
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:51,080
Since you found my wallet, I'll pay for this.

681
2745
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,420
My feelings.

682
2749
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,640
Is there something you like?

683
2753
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,640
You.

684
2757
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,530
I think I'm right.

685
2761
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,760
I like you.

689
2777
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,020
I could've walked here by myself. You took me home even though your leg hurts.

690
2781
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:45,360
It's healed now, after I watched the movie.

691
2785
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:50,430
Then, you'll be fine tomorrow.

692
2789
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:54,470
Even though you looked fine today, too.

693
2793
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,100
I'm going.

694
2797
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,700
Okay.

695
2801
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:22,190
You can sit down.

696
2805
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,800
So. You're the same major as her. What grade?

697
2809
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,170
I'm in my last year.

698
2813
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,360
- So, you're going to graduate soon? 
 - Yes.

699
2818
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,810
What did you do after the movies?

700
2822
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:51,400
What? Oh, we had a glass of beer.

701
2826
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,740
One glass? Really?

702
2830
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:59,060
No, I had around four. Jin Joo had around three.

703
2834
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:04,850
Three? She drinks three? Glasses? or in 500mL pints?

704
2838
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:07,050
500mL.

705
2842
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:11,030
You do drink a lot. What about your parents?

706
2846
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:15,500
That.. they work in education. So...

707
2850
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,780
Well, you don't have to tell me if you don't feel like it.

708
2854
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:21,840
To be honest, he's the director of the school.

709
2858
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,990
Of Hangook University? The one that Jin Joo attends?

710
2862
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,350
Yes.

711
2866
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:35,010
Please don't let Jin Joo know. No one knows this.

712
2870
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:39,760
Okay. Don't tell Jin Joo we met, either.

713
2874
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,540
- Keep it between us men. Okay? 
 - Yes.

714
2879
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:47,010
- So... Do you like her a lot? 
 - What?

715
2884
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:52,600
Do you like our Jin Joo a lot? Enough to watch a movie with her, drink about four pints.

716
2888
00:56:53,610 --> 00:57:01,180
Ah, yes. I like her a lot.

717
2892
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,340
Hi.

718
2896
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,930
Why are you here? Do you not have an umbrella?

719
2900
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:43,260
It wasn't raining when I came here. Is there somewhere to buy one?

720
2904
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,110
No need to buy one. There's one here.

721
2908
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,710
Let's use it. Come on.

722
2912
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,950
Don't cry after eating. Why are you always crying? It's like someone I know.

723
2916
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:27,640
How can an umbrella be so poorly constructed!

724
2920
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,610
Just fold it. It's through.

725
2924
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:09,310
Then until the humanities hall.

726
2928
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:31,360
This small thing, is so sly.

727
2932
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:36,860
He's making an old woman's heart flutter... Is he a playboy?

728
2936
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,590
- Excuse me. 
- Yes?

729
2941
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,940
Can you come in closer to me?

730
2945
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,740
Look at this! I'm right.

731
2949
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,830
If we walk like this, I get wet.

732
2953
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:54,410
It's my umbrella you know.

733
2957
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:58,970
Sorry, sorry.

734
2961
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,580
The rain will end soon, right?

735
2965
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,870
Probably.

736
2969
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,350
It's the festival you know.

737
2973

I'll pour you one myself.

740
2985
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:05,510
After you graduate, what will you do?

741
2989
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:10,530
Anything to help Jin Joo to not starve.

742
2993
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:15,910
So, what? What do you like? Or want to do?

743
2997
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:21,130
What I like? It's Jin Joo. So.. Whatever Jin Joo likes..

744
3001
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,910
I'll... Yeah.

745
3005
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,530
What kind of man has no dreams!

746
3009
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:32,000
No, I do! Having a kid with Jin Joo and living happily with her.

747
3013
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,950
- That's my dream.
  - What?

748
3018
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:37,290
Seeing me, doesn't mean you can meet Jin Joo. This is just round one.

749
3022
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:39,610
You know right? The review of application materials.

750
3026
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:42,740
You have a long way to go, preliminaries, the final round etc.

751
3030
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:48,820
Yes! I will never give up! I'll make it to the end.

752
3034
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:53,690
Don't laugh! I'll get attached to you. I'll lose my sense of objective judgment.

753
3038
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:57,930
Yes, I'm sorry, Father.

754
3042
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:01,440
Why am I your father?

755
3046
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,500
Then... Father-in-law?

756
3050
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,010
Father-in-law?

757
3054
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:11,720
Then? Ahjusshi.

758
3058
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:18,840
All I know is how to love.

759
3062
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:25,760
More than that, the trials and tribulations

760
3066
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:33,680
are what cannot be avoided. That's what I realized.

761
3070
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,930
Now the answer is

762
3074
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:39,280
Go Back Couple Episode 6 Preview

763
3078
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,530
Hey, you don't know when you'll go back in time. You already seduced a boy?

764
3082
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,640
You're stuck by his side.

765
3086
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,940
Speak for yourself.

766
3090
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:48,770
For someone who hasn't even shown his face the past three years at the festival. What's with him now?

767
3094
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:51,540
Nam Gil, where are you coming from?

768
3098
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,030
Are you hungry?

769
3102
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:54,370
Hey! Ma Jin Joo!

770
3106
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,770
Is there something wrong?  The May Queen fled.

771
3110
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,740
What do you mean you're the May Queen?

772
3114
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,530
It'll be a relief if she doesn't get last place.

773
3118
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:04,420
Humanities, Ma Jin Joo!

774
3122
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:06,930
Isn't that her? The girl you're trying to play?

775
3126
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:10,390
Go make a move, you're gonna lose her!
