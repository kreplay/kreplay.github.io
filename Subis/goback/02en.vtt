00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,120
What could it be?

2
7
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,420
Seo Jin, shh.

3
11
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,400
That's right.

4
15
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,960
- Hey!
 - What? Hey, hey, hey.  Come quickly and see.

5
20
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,150
I don't think a woman will come. Kim Jong Min will be stood up.

6
24
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,860
I think Kim Jong Min will be stood up.

7
28
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,140
Why did you turn it off?

8
32
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,920
I told you to play with Seo Jin, and you're watching TV again?

9
36
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,150
You want to watch the blind date of a celebrity you don't know?

10
40
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,850
I shudder just by hearing the name of this show! Because of you! You!

11
44
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,540
If I would have known all this would happen, I could've been living as a prosecutor right now.

12
48
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,110
You think you are the only one with good memories?

13
52
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,760
Judges and investigators? Bull.  You think studying hard will make anyone a prosecutor?

14
56
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,730
People who are good at studying usually end up as prosecutors.

15
60
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,180
Okay. Anyway ...

16
64
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,190
Look. You shouldn't have seduced me when we first met.

17
68
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,630
You seduced me first. With your eyes like this.

18
72
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,980
You kept blinking like that, so I thought you had an eye problem.

19
76
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,420
Wow, this woman's remembering it wrong.

20
80
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,430
You had your eyes on me first and made it seem like you would die if I didn't pick you. Truly.

21
84
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,140
You were like this.

22
88
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,850
You did that first! Staring at me.

23
92
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,350
Do you not remember? I chose you because you scared me. Truly.

24
96
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,550
You seduced me first by doing this with your eyes.

25
100
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,620
You kept blinking like that!

26
104
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,770
That is not what happened.

27
108

Episode 2: Memories Are Only Remembered When It's Convenient To Do So.

28
112
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,730
Oppa, you are heading to Professor Hwang's class, right?

29
116
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,600
I put a lot of effort in to get this from previous students.You should look at it.

30
120
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,260
If you put in that much effort, you should use it yourself.

31
124
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,860
Sunbae! This is a newly released one. You should have it.

32
128
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,490
If it's new, you should have it.

33
132
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,050
I don't know whose household he comes from but he's basically gleaming.

34
136
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,510
They raised him well.

35
140
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,860
I left <i> that </i> kid and I went for that loser.

36
144
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,840
Hello!

37
148
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,360
Oppa.

38
152
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,470
You must be going to class.

39
156
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,280
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Macarena Team @ Viki.com</i>

40
160
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,910
"You must be going to class." 
 What then, did he come to play pool?

41
165
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,740
Are you out of your mind? Or are you suddenly lonely? You want to date?

42
169
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,760
Why? I said hi because i was happy to see him.

43
173
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,380
You said hello because you were happy to see him? After you humiliated him yesterday?

44
177
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,070
What?

45
181
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,030
<i>Look at him! He's so handsome!</i>

46
185
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,840
<i>You! Let's date.</i>

47
189
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,500
<i>He asked her out!</i>

48
193
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,010
<i> -I don't want to
 - Why?</i>

49
198
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,940
<i>You smell like sweat.</i>

50
202
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,230
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

51
206
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,640
<i>Poor him!</i>

52
210
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,520
<i> Wow, I can't believe this.</i>

53
214
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,970
That's impossible. When did I do that?

54
218
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,820
You did that yesterday!

55
222
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,690
Wow! Yesterday you hated him and his sweat smell. Today you say hi you're happy to see him?

56
226
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,160
Wow! You're scary!

57
230
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,380
OMG!  OMG!

58
234
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,770
Is that why he looked so hurt? Ugh, I don't know!

59
238
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,790
Why did I say that?

60
242
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,630
You would know, not me.

61
246
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,890
I mean, he had just finished playing sports so he would've smelled like sweat. You and your germophobia.

62
250
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,060
That's right!

63
254
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,460
Wow, I'm crazy. I'm really crazy. Crazy.

64
258
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,010
Are you sick?

65
262
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,020
<i>It's not that kids these days are scary. Kids have <i> always  </i> been scary.</i>

66
266
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,970
Aren't you seniors?

67
270
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,490
No matter what happens, you must never pick a fight.

68
274
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,960
You must follow what you're supposed to do. The seniors will deal with other seniors!

69
278
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,670
<i> Aigoo these bastards. At least they know "fair play."</i>

70
282
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:35,630
<>I'm so tired. How long do I have to do this?  I think I'm going to die.

71
286
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,330
Seniors, when can we stop?

72
290
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,870
Stop being a wuss. Until the day a woman comes into this room,

73
294
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,840
you have to remain in this position.

74
298
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,130
What woman will come in here? That is basically telling us to stay like this forever.

75
302
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,130
It's a girl!

76
306
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,140
It's a girl!

This psycho

84

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,380
Dok Jae! Oh, right, your hair was like that!

85
342

All down!!

86
346
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,830
How could you say something like that?

87
350
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,280
<i> Of course he would smell like sweat. He was working out. </i>

Aigoo, Ma Jin Joo. Aigoo, Ma Jin Joo.

90
362
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,900
Hello, Jin Joo!

91
366
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,300
<i> What were their names? I think one was class rep.</i>

92
370
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,730
- Hey you, come to the front! 
 - Yes.

93
375
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,950
<i>No, it's not. It's her.</i>

94
379
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,010
Hey!

95
383
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,350
Cheon Seol!

96
387
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,010
You're Cheon Seol, right?

97
391
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,170
What is wrong with you? Are you reuniting with lost family?

98
395
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,850
The professor came. Sit down.

99
399
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,860
Oh, right. We used to be really close back then.

100
403
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,440
But, she left and we stopped talking.

101
407
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,150
Did I do something wrong to her?

102
411
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,670
I don't know.

103
415
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,100
Did she make a mistake this morning? Everyone's been talking.

104
419
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,110
All these rumors...

105
423
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,120
<i>Why did she leave without telling us that time?</i>

106
427
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,750
<i>Regent Heung Seon  vs Empress Myeong Seong.  Whose policy was best?</i>

107
431
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,610
You guys prepared your presentations well, right?

108
435
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,240
Yes.

109
439
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,550
<i> Wow, can you believe this? I'm in a class in school right now.</i>

110
443
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,870
Today's topic will be Regent Heung Seon vs Empress Myeong Seong.

111
447
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,060
They were constantly fighting over different policies and having power struggles.

112
451
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,000
<i>Even Empress Myeong Seong couldn't avoid conflict with the in-laws. I hate it.</i>

113
455
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,230
This led to the downfall of Joseon Dynasty. Everyone, shall we make our presentation on our discussion?

114
459
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,040
So Queen Myeong Seong's supporters opposed Regent Heung Seon's policy of isolation and  rejection

115
463
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,740
of diplomatic relations with other countries which was the main reason our modernization was delayed.

116
467
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,320
<i>Oh, she's on the wife's side.</i>

117
471
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,710
<i> Yes, you will experience all this later.</i>

118
475
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,660
Nice. Next group.

119
479
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,430
Let's see the next presentation.

120
483
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,540
Why?

121
487
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,370
- Hurry go!
 - Where?

122
492
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,770
Who's the next presenter?

123
496
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,100
You're the presenter of our group. Hurry!

124
500
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,290
- Me? 
 - Hurry and go.  Make the presentation.

125
505
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,700
Ma Jin Joo from Group 3?

126
509
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:10,160
I...forgot  the entire contents of our discussion.

127
513
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,740
How long was it that you met with your group so that you would forget?

128
517
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,700
Then, just tell us your opinion. Is it Regent Heung Seon or Empress Myeong Seong?

129
521
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,630
Uh... I...

130
525
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,680
I think Go Jong was at fault. <i>(Go Jong was the son of Regent Heung Seon and the husband of Queen Myeong Seong).</i>

131
529
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,760
Go Jong? Why?

132
533
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,500
Well, his wife and his father were fighting. King Go Jong should've stepped forward.

133
537
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,050
The husband should've quickly stepped forward and moved out.

134
541
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,450
But, this is the palace during the Joseon Dynasty.

135
545
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:59,400
Oh, yes. But, anyway, whenever you look at those families, it's always the husband's fault.

136
549
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,630
The husband should've mediated between them... I mean, how could a wife win against her father-in-law?

137
553
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:11,420
Can the wife fit to accommodate for everyone's needs? Is the wife a puzzle to fit everything perfectly?

138
557
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,020
We?

139
561
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,010
So you think the dynasty fell because of Go Jong?

140
565
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,400
Of course not, just something like that..

141
569
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,090
What a refreshing opinion. I like it.

142
573
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,760
So, who are the members of Group 3?

143
577
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,060
<i>F. Lacked an understanding of topic during debate.</i>

144
581
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,150
What did you do?

145
585
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,130
Well, how could I remember something from so long ago?

146
589
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,240
But, the debate was yesterday.

147
593
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,260
Okay, we'll just go along with the fact that you forgot the debate.

148
597
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,480
But what? Go Jong?

149
601
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,490
She asked my opinion. You guys don't know but father-in-laws can be worse that mothers-in-law.

150
605
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,440
He's so picky, he doesn't eat kimchi that has fish sauce in it.

151
609
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,540
- Ugh, I thought of him again. 
 - Who?

152
614
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,740
There's someone like that. A father-in-law who acts like a mother-in-law.

153
618
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,840
<i>Give me one.</i>

154
622
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,790
<i>Fish sauce? Don't you know I only eat kimchi with anchovy sauce?</i>

155
626
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,470
<i>I'm not eating it! Make it again.</i>

156
630
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,760
<i>I'm living with a mother-in-law!</i>

157
634
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,600
Isn't it too harsh?

158
638
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,400
I thought she wanted my opinion. I can't believe this.

159
642
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,700
<i> I </i> can't believe this.

160
646
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,020
Is this your concept today?

161
650
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,660
Movie Club

162
654
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,360
Wow, it's been so long since I saw this film.

163
658
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:16,190
Oh this one is here too!

164
662
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,380
Brad Pitt!

165
666
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,700
Oh, I remember! Your hairstyle's inspired by Brad Pitt's.

166
670
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,090
You, young punks. When will I see this again?

167
674
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,280
You're so cute!

168
678
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,030
What is this?

169
682
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,570
Aww, so cute!

170
686
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,460
Wow, to see how you guys looked again when you were young.

171
690
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,730
I will kill him!

172
694
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,920
Hey, I can't believe you did that to a senior.

173
698
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,000
No. Him.

174
702
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,730
You! Did you drink during the day? Why would you laugh there?

175
706
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,410
Do you see my hand shaking? I lost my hand because of you.

176
710
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:16,300
Are you that bored with life? Were you trying to make a spectacle?

177
714
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,440
Aigoo. This Hyung is living something spectacular indeed.

178
718
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,240
What is that crazy guy saying? Are you not sober?

179
722
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,210
Okay. Sounds good. I'll explain everything.

180
726
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:34,240
Listen to me well, kids. I don't know what's going on right now, either. But what I appear to be is not the whole truth.

181
730
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,940
I look like Choi Ban Do right now, right? But I'm not the Choi Ban Do that you think you know.

182
734
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,210
If you're not Ma Jin Joo right now, then who are you?

183
738
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,420
So, I'm not 20 right now. I suddenly came to the past!

184
742
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,810
How do I remember something that happened 18 years ago?

185
746
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,140
You're 38, then?

186
750
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,930
Ha! With that face?

187
754
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:08,260
Well, my face is still the same. When I woke up this morning, I became 20 and it was the year 1999!

188
758
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,260
Ah, I see. So it's like time traveling. Like that movie <i> Back to the Future </i>.

189
762
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,790
That's right. <i> Back to the Future. </i> It's exactly that. I knew you were smart.

190
766
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,110
So what I am like in the future?

191
770
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,030
You?

192
774
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,910
Hold on. It won't stop trembling. Massage it.

193
778
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,280
Hey, how much do you have to work out to have that kind of body?

194
782
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,850
Be easy, we don't recover at this age.

195
786
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,770
What is hopeless is your bodies.

196
790
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,430
Oh!

197
794
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:13,070
Do some exercise!...my batting skills are still good, right?

198
798
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:18,610
but the director keep saying I lost it

199
802
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,310
I have to go this time. To the Korean Series.

200
806
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,930
<i>Cheering Fairy</i>

201
810
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,450
You'll get healthier. Really healthy.

202
814
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,970
What about him?

203
818
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,500
Does he still go around like this?

204
822
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,230
Hey, his hair will fall out!

205
826
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,970
- Get a haircut! 
 - Shut it.

206
831
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:49,400
Don't say that. No Dok Jae, do whatever you want with your hair.

207
835
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,660
Just don't shave it.

208
839
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,970
What are you saying?

209
843
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:00,170
What about me? Do I have a girlfriend?

210
847
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,400
Is there a girlfriend?

211
851
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,480
Yes

212
855
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,300
I got a yacht.

213
859
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,010
Darling?

214
863
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,550
<i> Only a girlfriend? No. A wife, too. </i>

215
867
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:46,470
I become an aerobics teacher?

216
871
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,110
Me?

217
875
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,440
Let's go everyone!

218
879
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,130
Your husband's in front of you!  Hit him hard!

219
883
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,890
That's it!

220
887
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:05,120
Next, kick him! Higher!

221
891
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,110
One! Two!

222
895
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,330
Not exactly an aerobics teacher but, something similar to that.

223
899
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,940
This seems unbelievable.

224
903
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:27,070
Well, I don't know what's happening to me, either. Up until yesterday night, that tightwad-

225
907
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,820
Anyhow, just imagine how surprised I am with this situation.

226
911
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,610
I can't tell you guys about the pain I experienced before I recover from it.

227
915
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:45,300
If you ever think I'm being strange, just remember I'm from the future and be understanding.

228
919
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,920
Oh. You have injuries, too.

229
923
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,430
We didn't even know you were like that.

230
927
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,270
No, don't worry.

231
931
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,870
What a crazy guy.

232
935
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,770
She's crazy. She gone completely crazy.

233
939
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,910
Is she pulling an April Fool's prank again? She's gone crazy from studying too much.

234
943
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,170
Now he's lying about anything.

235
947
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,440
Is the time machine in your house?

236
951
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,760
We should go see it.

237
955
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,160
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

238
959
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,000
People who are good at studying are the best at creating detailed lies.

239
963
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,500
Who would believe what I am saying?

240
967
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,260
Wait for me! I don't know how to get there.

241
971
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,080
Who would believe me?

242
975
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,210
Those little bastards. Let's go together!

243
979
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,710
Hey, I don't know the way!

244
983
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,230
Excuse me.

248
999
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,330
Me? Really?

249
1003
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,700
Yes.

250
1007
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,400
If you don't mind me asking, could you give me your number?

251
1011
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,450
Oh, my. What is this?

252
1015
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,610
He thinks I'm pretty!

253
1019
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,720
Uh.. I don't have a phone or pager.

254
1023
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,270
Oh, you don't. Then, what about your home phone?

255
1027
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,010
Home phone? What was it? How could I remember?

256
1031
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,310
I don't really know...

257
1035
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm not doing it on purpose. I just don't know.

258
1039
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,030
Then, can you tell me your major and the area you live in?

259
1043
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,530
Oh, my. Excuse me! I have a pager here.

260
1047
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,680
Isn't it that the freshman English major? Did you reject him?

261
1051
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,260
Just give out your number. It's not like you will start dating just because you give it to him.

262
1055
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,080
Pretty girls just...

263
1059
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,250
He really said I was pretty!

264
1063
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,980
If I pass by, he says, "You look pretty today, as well."

265
1067
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,610
He's probably doing that to make you buy something.

266
1071
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,180
Who's pretty? You? Are you on some drug?

267
1075
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:53,470
No, even when he's with other women, he says it to me.

268
1079
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,630
Because you look the dumbest out of all of them.

269
1083
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,770
No, it's not that. He really did it because I'm pretty!

270
1087
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,340
He was always here somewhere.

Oh, thank you.

275
1107

If you don't mind me asking, can we talk really quick?

00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,520
Yes.

Wow this mom's skin is very pretty!

You have such a bright face! Oh, it's so bright and perfect.

285

This is hard to get in Gangnam. And you are so pretty.

286

And I think you'll teach your kids well. So, I'll give you 50% off.

287

00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,960
But, this mom's skin is so nice!

Oh, there were this many pretty women here? I thought it was only you.

290
1167
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,540
Anyway, he's handsome and good at selling. He'll have great success!

291

Let's go in, Pretty Woman #1.

Let's go. You need to be punished.

00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,220
Oh, that's right. Now that I'm thinking about it, who would believe this?

302
1216
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,420
Have you decided?

303
1220
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,480
What? Decide what?

304
1224
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,500
July 24th, the last day. What are you going to do?

305
1228
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,280
Hey, don't believe this. It's a lie.

306
1232
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,530
A lie? The planets are lining up and there's going to be an apocalypse.

307
1236
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:45,220
The planets could collide and we could die. Or a war could break out.

308
1240
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,490
Don't even mention it. The unusual pattern in our climate is because something out there is trying to control us and eliminate some of the human population.

309
1244
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:55,480
- We could all be wiped out. 
 - Be quiet! I can't focus.

310
1249
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,170
Hey. You guys stay here.

311
1253
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,510
Where are you going?

312
1257
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,150
<i> Madam.</i>

313
1261
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,650
Ow! It hurts.

314
1265
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,910
Are you crazy? How dare you touch her?

315
1269
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,120
<i>With one punch I think I convinced her.</i>

316
1273
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,430
<i>She seemed dumb so she was easy to seduce.</i>

317
1277
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,000
<i>I think I ended this affair with that punch.</i>

318
1281
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,980
Hey.

319
1285
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,010
You are here.

320
1289
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,110
You bastard, I said you were dead when I met you in college.

321
1293
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,790
You're dead.

322
1297
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:53,030
A medical student's night occurs only once a year. What a shame.

323
1301
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:58,020
Right? It's a shame. But, what can I do? I have to study.

324
1305
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,640
Oh! I'm so sorry. I was thinking about something else.

325
1309
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,090
Hey! Look where you're going!

326
1313
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,980
No, it's fine. It's fine. That could happen.

327
1317
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,920
Wow, I'm so sorry. What should I do? Oh, drink this.

328
1321
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,790
Oh, okay.

329
1325
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,740
I'm sorry.

330
1329
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,930
Gosh, you're so... nice!

331
1333
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,440
Why would I make a big deal? He didn't do it intentionally.

332
1337
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,040
I said he was dead.

333
1341
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:56,000
It's a bit of a shame he had his glasses on. It would've hit him directly.

334
1345
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,240
Ramen ₩800

335
1349
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,680
Dish with rice, soup, and sides. ₩1500

336
1353
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,640
No way. ₩1500?

337
1357
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,360
It's ₩1500?

338
1361
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,590
It's so cheap!

339
1365
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,540
You could buy a bag of chips with that money!

340
1369
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,890
Hey!

341
1373
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,390
<i> We demand an explanation, Chief Director! </i>

342
1377
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,700
<i>Meal prices increased!</i>

343
1381
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,220
<i>Explain, Chief Director!</i>

344
1385
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,640
Are you eating chips covered in gold? How is this the price of chips?

345
1389
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,600
This is good.

346
1393
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,180
Why aren't you eating?

347
1397
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,620
Oh. You keep eating.

348
1401
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,300
I'm full.

349
1405
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,630
You're full? I'll eat it.

350
1409
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,210
Me too.

351
1413
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,770
It doesn't taste like anything

352
1417
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,060
How is your short rib soup? Let me try.

353
1421
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,460
Since they made it in big amounts for a long time, it tastes better.

354
1425
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,950
If you make it at home, it doesn't taste like this.

355
1429
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,190
Did you starve for weeks? You usually don't eat this.

356
1433
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,260
Why are you eating so fast?

357
1437
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,570
You should try having a child.

358
1441
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,920
What?

359
1445
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,260
A child?

360
1449
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,640
No, no. It's nothing.

361
1453
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,900
Eat up, it is yummy.

362
1457
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,650
Wow, I feel like my stomach's going to explode. I ate well.

363
1461
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,720
You used to say that you didn't feel happy when you were full.

364
1465
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,100
Being full is the good times.

365
1469
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,130
Whether it goes in to your mouth or nose, eating to live while raising a child is sorrowful.

366
1473
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,630
What?

367
1477
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,590
Okay. Our Jin Joo had to change. Good thinking.

368
1481
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,280
Oh. Oh, yeah.

369
1485
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,960
Hey, what should we do after we eat?

370
1489
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,000
Why are you asking like you're a stranger?

371
1493
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,220
Why? What are we doing?

372
1497
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,540
A blind date!

373
1501
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,980
A blind date? The date that I'm thinking of?

374
1505
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,660
What's wrong with you?

375
1509
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,390
Yes!

376
1513
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,880
Why are we crossing paths again? Let's not get involved with each other.

377
1517
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,690
Ugh, Ma Jin Joo. Let's not cross paths.

378
1521
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,920
<i>Why is she here?</i>

379
1525
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,400
<i>What is this? No way...</i>

380
1529
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,560
<i>The first day I met her?</i>

381
1533
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,320
<i>The first day I met this punk?</i>

382
1537
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,460
Let's see how many successful matches are made.

383
1541
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,960
Hey, are their eyebrows supposed to be seagulls?

384
1545
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,450
And, why do all of their lips look bruised?

385
1549
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,780
Did you bring that bomb here?

386
1553
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,480
Did you see their hair? It's like a stoplight. Red, green... What is this?

387
1557
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,780
Yeah, but look at him.

388
1561
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,170
That scared me.

389
1565
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,650
<i>Right, I met Ma Jin Joo at this blind date.</i>

390
1569
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,360
<i>Ugh, why is that day today?</i>

391
1573
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,230
<i>Wait, no. This is good.</i>

392
1577
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,140
<i>I'll just not get involved with her forever.</i>

393
1581
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,650
<i>Why are even my dreams nightmares?</i>

394
1585
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,710
<i>I've been cursed for my whole life because of this day, child.</i>

395
1589
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,290
<i>Let's not get involved. 
Let's not get involved.</i>

396
1594
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,590
<i>Don't get involved with me.</i>

397
1598
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,260
You should have it first.

398
1602
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,650
Okay.

399
1606
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,920
<i>Let's not get involved. 
 Let's not get involved.</i>

400
1611
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,010
Okay, should we introduce ourselves now?

401
1615
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,560
I'm a First Year Civil Engineering major, Eom Won Hee. Not Mother (eomeoni), it's Eom Won Hee.

402
1619
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,740
I'm a First Year Civil Engineering major. I call myself the Kim Won Joon level of handsome. I'm  Lee Dae Young.

403
1623
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,100
I'm Go Dok Jae.

404
1627
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,920
Don't call me Dok Jae, but Go Dok.

405
1631
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,580
I'm An Jae Woo.

406
1635
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,090
I like to listen to the radio. And my special talent, well..

407
1639
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,820
I'm trying to decide.

408
1643
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,370
Hey, it's a cockroach!

409
1647
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,850
Where?

410
1651
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,110
That's my friend's special talent. His fast speed.

411
1655
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,850
You mischievous guy.

412
1659
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,300
<i>I just need to not get involved with her.</i>

413
1663
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,460
I'm a civil engineering major, Choi Ban Do.

414
1667
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,740
I'm from Byunsanban-do, so I'm Choi Ban Do.

415
1671
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,200
I am always thankful to my parents for not calling me Byunsan. (Byun = poop)

416
1675
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,180
Done.

417
1679
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,610
<i>You're just poop. A pile of poop.</i>

418
1683
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:30,080
So, I think we're done with the boys. Let's move on to the girls.

419
1687
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,790
Yeah. Bo Reum, we'll start with you.

420
1691
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,220
How do you know my name?

421
1695
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,420
Huh?

422
1699
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:47,360
Oh, it says it right there. Yoon Bo Reum.

423
1703
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,620
<i>Yoon Bo Reum.</i>

424
1707
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,960
Oh, Yoon Bo Reum

425
1711
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,360
<i>Oh, that was a close call. It slipped out without me knowing.</i>

426
1715
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,680
<i>Geez, that scared me.</i>

427
1719
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,310
Since we are the same age, let's drop formal language. I am freshman history major Yoon Bo Ruem.

428
1723
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:13,150
<i>Why would he pick a painful love? You can't, my friend.</i>

429
1727
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,200
I'm a history major, Cheon Seol.

430
1731
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,120
I'm a history major, too. Go Eun Bee.

431
1735
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:25,000
Hey, there's something in your face. I see a bit of Suzy.

432
1739
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,040
Kang Suzy? 
 Kang Suzy? 


433
1745
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,230
Oh, that's not the Suzy I was talking about. There's a young and pretty Suzy I know.

434
1749
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,440
You guys will know later on in life.

435
1753
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,130
<i>No way.</i>

436
1757
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,160
I'm a history major. Seol Hyeon.

437
1761
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,500
What? (Today, Seol Hyeon is a pretty celebrity)

438
1765
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,360
Seol Hyeon.

439
1769
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,980
I'm a history major. I'm Ma Jin Joo.

440
1773
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,540
You are responsible for the bomb. Take care of the bomb properly ok.

441
1777
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,220
What do you mean by "getting rid of the bomb?" It's not like you are a kid anymore. Just let things happen.

442
1781
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,960
Today's your turn!

443
1785
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,620
My turn?

444
1789
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:27,050
How do I know which item belongs to the bomb. It's not like their names are written on it.

445
1793
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,060
If I don't know, I can't do it.

446
1797
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,450
Why are you acting like you don't know? Is it your first or second blind date?

447
1801
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,340
Do it correctly.

448
1805
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,410
<i>Why has she been staring at me? It's scary.</i>

449
1809
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,000
<i>No way. Has she...picked me?</i>

450
1813
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:08,240
<i>Oh that is right, she is the one who flirted so much with me back then.</i>

451
1817
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,930
<i>Isn't this why I ended up this way.</i>

452
1821
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:15,080
<i> Kiddo, you are scaring oppa.</i>

453
1825
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,130
<i>Suzy... Suzy.</i>

454
1829
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,140
So, who's picking first?

455
1833
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,200
Because of Yoon Bo Reum, my life...

456
1837
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:51,080
I hate that day so much. I wish I had gone to hell instead.

457
1841
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,910
I pity myself so much.

458
1845
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,570
She ruined my life!

459
1849
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:04,700
<i>Jae Woo, you're choosing your fate. I'll help you.</i>

460
1853
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,400
Oh, what is this? What the?

461
1857
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,140
Hey, you chose the giraffe!

462
1861
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,240
Oh, Suzy!

463
1865
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,480
It's mine.

464
1869
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,740
What? How is it yours? It's Suzy's!

465
1873
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,930
Even if you like him, you have to follow the rules.

466
1877
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,970
I usually wear 2 different earrings.

467
1881
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,410
So you're saying you use this one?

468
1885
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,970
It's hers.

469
1889
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,020
- What? 
  - It's hers. Not mine.

470
1894
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,770
These little...

471
1898
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,790
I've heard there are people who wear 2 different earrings.

472
1902
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,750
Be quiet. You don't know how she'll affect your life. Don't choose her.

473
1906
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,330
What are you saying?

474
1910
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,590
<i>Well, would you look at this.</i>

475
1914
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,800
There's still two left. Ban Do, you can go.

476
1918
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,230
<i>Choi Ban Do. You came, too?</i>

477
1922
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,140
<i>So, you rejected me?</i>

478
1926
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,780
<i>Are you saying you want to start a new life?</i>

479
1930
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,620
<i>Ah, what's wrong with her?</i>

480
1934
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:33,010
<i>You and I cannot meet! Let's not get involved.</i>

481
1938
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:51,280
<i>I owe you, Ban Do. I'll pay my debt at the next meeting.</i>

482
1942
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,780
<i>He doesn't want to get involved with me, huh?</i>

483
1946
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,060
<i>You traitor!</i>

484
1950
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,730
What? I got rid of the bomb!

485
1954
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:29,160
Bomb? Is she a bomb to you?

486
1958
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,770
The flying flower pig is a bomb!

487
1962
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:38,220
You..you. The girl I chose is a bomb! She's the dynamite.

488
1966
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,870
Her personality sucks. She's a shopaholic, has mysophobia, and has anger issues.

489
1970
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,500
She's the perfect bomb!

490
1974
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,300
Anger issues? What's that?

491
1978
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,340
What is that, you bastard?

492
1982
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,780
There's something like that. When you have a bad personality and you get mad whenever.

493
1986
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,550
But... how do you know that?

494
1990
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,020
How do I know? Because I've lived with...

495
1994
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,570
Lived?

496
1998
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:09,190
I heard it! Everyone knows it except for you.

497
2002
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,010
Get out.

498
2006
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,220
Is that so?

499
2010
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,800
Everyone knows? Then why don't I know?

500
2014
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,890
I have a weird feeling about this...

501
2018
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:29,010
- Hey. But, still, the Flower Pig! 
 - Hey!

502
2023
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,900
Let's split up.  We'll head out first.

503
2027
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,190
Thanks.

504
2031
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,400
It's nothing.

505
2035
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,890
We'll leave, too.

506
2039
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,820
But, where's Dok Jae and his partner?

507
2043
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,640
Flying flower pig? Hey.

508
2047
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,980
Are you crazy?

509
2051
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,210
Why are you calling me a bomb?

510
2055
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,280
Jae Woo!

511
2059
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,570
Hey. Look at me properly.

512
2063
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:34,590
I'm going to drink. Follow me.

513
2067
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,150
<i>He rejected me earlier. What is this situation?</i>

514
2071
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:52,460
<i>I chose her to reject her so we wouldn't get involved with each other.</i>

515
2075
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,310
Are you two not leaving?

516
2079
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:57,330
Huh? Well...soon

517
2083
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:04,600
<i>Looking from here, she actually does look pretty.</i>

518
2087
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,720
<i>You should've grown up like this, woman.</i>

519
2091
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,220
<i>This bastard...does he by chance want to be together again?</i>

520
2095
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,790
<i>With me? He's crazy.</i>

521
2099
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,470
<i>Oh, oh,  I'm crazy. I must be crazy. This can't be.</i>

522
2103
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,750
<i>Let's end this right here.</i>

523
2107
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,470
Excuse me, Ma Jin Joo.

524
2111
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:29,530
Looking at you, I see that you have to be studying right now.

525
2115
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,640
Ma Jin Joo, you're good at studying right?

526
2119
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,180
A woman who stays at home with her kid has no charm. What would she do?

527
2123
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,540
You're never full even if you eat.

528
2127
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,640
Then, what? You find a husband who earns money like a gum seller.

529
2131
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,690
Hurrah for that!

530
2135
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:47,230
<i>Living with you was like being tortured and getting painfully chewed on all over.</i>

531
2139
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,580
So, you shouldn't think of finding a boy here and marrying him.

532
2143
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,000
You should study. Study hard to become a career woman.

533
2147
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,830
It's cool. "Gold Miss." Okay?

534
2151
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,390
What did you say?

535
2155
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:02,800
I know you're unhappy. I know. I know.

536
2159
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,610
But, you'll understand what I'm saying when you're older.

537
2163
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:12,790
Anyway. Study hard. You can do it!

538
2167
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:15,030
Well, I'm done here.

539
2171
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,750
Just in case you might misinterpret what I'm saying...

540
2175
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:30,610
I am not interested in you at all. I'm giving you a brush off!

541
2179
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,630
What is this?

542
2183
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:43,740
I...wow.

543
2187
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,290
I'm a hero. How many lives have I saved?

544
2191
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:58,540
You said you wanted to study. You could be a doctor or prosecutor. Live a life full of variety.

545
2195
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,980
I lived with you because I was me. If it was anyone else, you would've been kicked out.

546
2199
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,360
You don't even know anything.

547
2203
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,500
Min Seo Young?

548
2207
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:31,090
<i>Do you remember my first love, Min Seo Young, in the past?</i>

549
2211
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,800
<i>I should have seduced her then. I was too shy though.</i>

550
2215
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,870
<i>Even if you did go back to the past, you can't seduce her.</i>

551
2219
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:43,460
<i>If I do, I'll seduce her. Would I get Ma Jin Joo?</i>

552
2223
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,940
This crazy guy. Did he choose me just to say that?

553
2227
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:18,270
Torturing my husband? Torturing?

554
2231
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,630
He's saying whatever he wants.

555
2235
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,810
Where is he?

556
2239
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,800
Does he think he came here by himself?

557
2243
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,770
Excuse me..

558
2247
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,830
You're Min Seo Young, right?

559
2251
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,820
Huh?

560
2255
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:57,100
Is he...

561
2259
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:02,070
Oh, sorry. Hi.

562
2263
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:06,630
Do you know me?

563
2267
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,120
Maybe you...

564
2271
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,780
don't?

565
2275
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:16,630
I don't really know you, but I don't not know you.

566
2279
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,870
Then that means you know me.

567
2283
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,100
What?

568
2287
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:27,930
♫ <i> It's like I'm dreaming. ♫</i>

573
2307
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:00,240
Wow, Ban Do's amazing.

574
2311
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,220
He went for his first love.

575
2315
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:08,620
How did he live when he missed Seo Young so much?

576
2319

♫ <i> I'm praying for... ♫</i>

577
2323
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:18,040
So, this day gave me a miracle to show me this?

578
2327
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,230
Ma Jin Joo, you lived the wrong way all along.

579
2331
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:28,830
It's good, then. I got my closure after my divorce.

580
2335
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,810
Seo Jin.

581
2339
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,310
Seo Jin!

582
2343
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:07,030
Seo Jin.

583
2347
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,800
Seo Jin.

584
2351
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,590
It's dangerous. Come here.

585
2355
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:48,030
That mean bastard.

586
2359
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:26,440
Please go to Seongbuk-dong, Building Number 31.

This is different from what you told me.

599
2412
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:41,530
I told you to be a part of the student council, but you participated in the ROTC for no reason.

600
2416
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,580
Why? You should just start doing whatever I say not to do.

601
2420
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,310
Why don't you go study History while you are at it?

602
2424
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,410
You should even date, which I've forbidden.<

603
2428
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,800
<i>That's a good idea.</i>

604
2432
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:06,150
It's Nam Gil!

605
2436
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,410
<i>He's so handsome!</i>

606
2440
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,920
<i>You.</i>

607
2444
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:15,040
<i>Will you date me?</i>

608
2448
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,590
What is this?

609
2452
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:24,750
I don't want to.

610
2456
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,980
<i>She's crazy.</i>

611
2460
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,680
- Is she out of her mind. 
 - What is wrong with her?

612
2465
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,360
<i>Why would she reject him?</i>

613
2469
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,600
Why?

614
2473
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,780
<i>You smell like sweat.</i>

615
2477
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:48,750
My god.

616
2481
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,540
He's so foolish.

617
2485
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,400
What is she?

618
2489
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:25,810
In movies, people use time machines to time travel.

619
2493
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:30,810
If not that, they time travel when they wake up from sleeping.

620
2497
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,740
You're not sleeping?

621
2501
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,250
Yeah. I'm not.

622
2505
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:55,310
"To my dear mom."

623
2509
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:01,340
<i> Divorce, time slip, dream? </i>

624
2513
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,120
<i> Mr. Yoo!</i>

625
2517
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,140
What is this?

626
2521
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,140
Look at him...

627
2525
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,170
He is my favorite.

628
2529
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,380
Me too, me too.

629
2533
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,410
What?

630
2537
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,290
What? What? What!

631
2541
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,610
watch TV or sleep!

632
2545
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,850
You're putting a lot of pressure on me!

633
2549
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:46,060
Did I feed her something wrong?

634
2553
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:49,510
What's wrong with her?

635
2557
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,840
Maybe she's going through puberty late.

636
2561
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,000
Late? Do you not remember?

637
2565
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,320
She put us through so much when it happened during junior high.

638
2569
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,610
She would not be human if she does it again.

639
2573
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:07,110
That's right. I wonder what is wrong with her.

640
2577
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:18,820
I will be leaving, Mom.

641
2581
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:24,470
Mom. Mom.

642
2585
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,250
She is scaring me.

643
2589
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,750
Me too.

644
2593
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:49,290
Yes.

645
2597
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:54,820
I can't sleep.

646
2601
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:07,120
Not sleeping.

647
2605
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,940
What is this?

648
2609
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:24,410
Why do I look like this?

649
2613
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:35,410
Yes. Yes.

650
2617
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,970
I'm here.

651
2621

<i> What happened in 1999. </i>

652
2625
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,850
<i>The real 1999.</i>

♬<i> I will meet the people who have left me. </i>

655
2638
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:08,640
Hey. Why do they have seagulls on their eyebrows?

656
2642
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,010
And, why do they all have bruises on their lips?

657
2646
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:16,970
Are you the one who planted the dynamite?

658
2650
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:19,980
she looks like she is going to explode.

659
2654
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,810
There are only two left. Ban Do, it is your turn.

660
2658
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,780
You have to take care of the bomb.

661
2662
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,720
It's your turn.

662
2666
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,110
Make sure-

I think he's up to something.

673
2710
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,550
You almost had me fooled.

674
2714
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,140
Your acting's as good as Jeon Do Yeon.

675
2718
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,980
Since this is my situation right now, I'm going to enjoy it.

676
2722
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,650
Can you give me your number?

677
2726
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:30,510
I told you not to flirt with me.

678

I'm sorry!

679

I never thought I'd come to a club with you!

680

- What's the matter? 
 - If I don't go now, when will I ever? 


681
2744
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:41,170
It's the guy who fell for me!

682
2748
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:43,030
Director Park?
