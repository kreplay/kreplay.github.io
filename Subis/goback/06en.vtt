Oh, of course, Seol, you're sensible.

149
607
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,280
What do you mean start dating when? Why put a date on it?

150
611
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,170
This is frustrating.

151
615
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:56,280
2 days since we started dating!

152
619
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,260
Men, are you ready?

153
623
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,600
You... No way..

154
627
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,590
Gosh, that scared me!

155
631
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,680
Why is it that my sad feelings are never wrong?

156
635
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,800
You remember? We've waiting for this ever since school started.

157
639
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:36,550
Of course, I remember. The black history label that would only end when I die.

158
643
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,600
The culprit!

159
647
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,470
<i> Nurse Mi Kyung</i>

160
651
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,040
Right? That's him, right?

161
655
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,790
- Team Leader Choi. 
 - Hi!

162
660
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,850
Isn't this you?

163
664
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,640
You had this in you?

164
668
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,270
Hey, I heard it's you. Where did you get this outfit? You look cool.

165
672
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,790
Well.. That time, I was a bit crazy, so...

166
676
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,730
Now I understand.

167
680
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,810
The future sent me back for this moment.

168
684
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,060
Okay. Great.

169
688
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,570
Look, friends. Whatever you're thinking of right now, forget it.

170
692
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:40,230
This? No. Don't do it. I'm not doing it, either.

171
696
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,260
Hey, what are you saying?

172
700
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,100
You said you wanted to come out on TV in the beginning of the semester. You're the one who planned this!

173
704
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,300
But it looks like he found hard to find materials. Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?

174
708
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,170
- But I think this will make for a very memorable event for our college years. 
 - Right?

175
713
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:01,440
Yeah, sure. Guys, that memory will haunt you until the die.

176
717
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,040
In any case, I'm leaving. Good luck!

177
721
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,130
Hey, where are you going, Ban Do?

178
725
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,060
You're really going to the library and not the school festival?

179
729
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,920
If the old seniors like us are sitting around at booths, the hoobaes will talk bad of us.

180
733
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,000
Right, you never really cared about these things.

181
737
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,660
It's been forever since I came to the school festival!

182
741
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,370
I thought you weren't interested in school festivals. I guess not?

183
745
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,780
School festivals and parties are good things.

184
749
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,780
You have to attend these things while you can. Later on, you're going to have to pay.

185
753
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,270
Paying to go to a school festival?

186
757
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:44,220
Festivals and carnivals... there's no place in Korea that doesn't have celebrations like that.

187
761
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,470
If you have time and money to go to those things, that's good.

188
765
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,810
It's our department's booth.

189
769
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,770
Oh, that looks so heavy. I'll help.

190
773
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,690
- Should I put it over there? 
 - Yeah.

191
778
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,490
Young girls don't have a lot of strength.

192
782
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,350
Here, here.

193
786
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,310
Thank you, thank you!

194
790
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,100
Hey! Be careful of the water.

195
794
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,840
If you get oil in water, that's bad!

196
798
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,200
You'll cause so much trouble.

197
802
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,790
Today, you know... I think the sun rose from the east, right?

198
806
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,050
Hi, Nam Gil!

199
810
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,370
He's never showed up at school's festival for the last three years. What's going on?

200
814
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,550
It's his last festival. He's in graduating class.

201
818
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:52,350
If he's a senior, and everyone's setting things up, why is he just sitting there?

202
822
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,300
You're throwing away all the precious meaty parts.

203
826
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,760
Hold the body of the knife and peel the skin only.

204
830
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,830
Oh... you spoke casually?

205
834
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,500
I mean please.

206
838
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,590
Okay, hold on, Mom.

207
842
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:26,040
So... Just a little sugar and a lot of red chili paste. Got it.

208
846
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:33,290
A little sugar.. Little?

209
850
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,830
Little... Yeah.

210
854
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,450
Oh, hey!

211
858
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,010
- Hey! 
 -This much would be "little."

212
863
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,030
With that amount, you won't even taste it.

213
867
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,190
You.. You know how to do this?

214
871
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,340
Hey, I could make spicy stir-fried pork with my eyes closed.

215
875
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,880
You didn't just throw everything together, right?

216
879
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,300
That doubt of yours.

217
883
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,660
Oh, it's so good! Wow, Jin Joo!

218
887
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,780
Here, Cheon Seol.

219
891
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,300
- Me, too. 
 - It's good.

220
896
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,370
Hey, Jin Joo. This is going to be our main dish.

221
900
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,850
That's a good idea, right?

222
904
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,870
Hey, it isn't even that great.

223
908
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,200
You guys will make an even bigger deal if I try making the other dishes, then.

224
912
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,390
Then... How many servings do I make?

225
916
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,430
I don't think we'll have a lot of customers, so we won't make too much. About... a hundred servings?

226
920
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,260
A hundred servings?

227
924
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,960
The delivery arrived!

228
928
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,240
Straighten out your face. We won't make you do all this by yourself.

229
932
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,220
It's about time they came..

230
936
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,600
♫ <i> When I look at you, everything stops. ♫</i>

231
940
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,630
♫ <i> I don't even know when it started. ♫</i>

232
944
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:22,830
♫ <i>You came to me like a dream, you shook my heart</i> ♫

233
948
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,450
The special forces protect our country and as for our food stand every year...

234
952
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,820
cooks in the reserve army protect us.

235
956
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,190
♫ <i>I love you</i> ♫

236
960
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,240
We did such a tough job.

237
964
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,580
Good job. It's our festival. Enjoy yourselves.

238
968
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,530
Okay!

239
972
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,380
- Oh, Min Seo Young. 
 - Yes?

240
977
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,010
These days, you're in good shape. Keep it up. And keep going with your weight management.

241
981
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,100
Okay!

242
985
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:13,220
What's with you? You're always smiling these days and there's no stopping.

243
989
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,020
You're in good shape, too. Is it a boy?

244
993
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:21,100
You shouldn't be practicing so hard. Look for a place to release your stress.

245
997
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,060
Seeing a man would be a good strategy.

246
1001
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,850
I'm glad the rain stopped.

247
1005
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,660
You didn't even have an umbrella. What were you going to do if you hadn't bumped into me?

248
1009
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:51,330
Huh? Oh... Right. I didn't even have an umbrella. What a relief I saw you.

249
1013
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,850
Ah... Campus music video pop. Are you going to enter?

250
1017
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,350
That? No, I'm not doing that.

251
1021
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,240
I'm not a kid. Why would I try so hard to be on air?

252
1025
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,320
Why? It looks fun, do it. It'll be cool to see you on TV.

253
1029
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,460
Really? Nah, it's okay.

254
1033
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,110
You shouldn't cross a river you can't return. It's best to lead a quiet life.

255
1037
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:25,870
You always say to me, "Do what's fun for you! Do whatever you want!" But you're so careful yourself.

256
1041
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,880
Really?

257
1045
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,700
Hold on.

258
1049
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,370
Hi, Mom.

259
1053
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,420
I don't want to do it.

260
1057
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,620
Why would I enter a competition I won't even win?

261
1061
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,710
I don't want to!

262
1065
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,280
I'm hanging up.

263
1069
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,960
Wow, that was scary. You know how to get annoyed.

264
1073
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,770
How could a person only have good characteristics?

265
1077
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,990
Who said you only have good characteristics?

266
1081
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,050
Hey!

267
1085
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,520
In the army, you can scoop rice and soup with this. You can do everything.

268
1089
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,670
With this amount, we can think one spoonful of food is equal to one shovelful.

269
1093
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,720
Hey, Jin Joo. If you were going to help out at food stands, you should've entered the May Queen competition.

270
1097
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,560
May Queen?

271
1101
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:52,490
Oh, yeah! I... I was one of the candidates in the beginning of semester, huh?

272
1105
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,760
Right.

273
1109
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,410
While I'm in the student body of humantities department...

274
1113
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,540
I hoped our department would produce a May Queen candidate.

275
1117
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,040
You insisted that you won't enter.

276
1121
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,770
Wow, that's right. I must've really been that pretty.

277
1125
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,220
Geez...

278
1129
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,720
Done, it's all done! You can't even leave one speck of leftover.

279
1133
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,070
Hey, what do we do with this?

280
1137
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,210
What are you doing? I don't have any other clothes.

281
1141
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,550
I'm sorry, are you okay? It doesn't look that bad.

282
1145
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,240
- What the heck? 
 - I knew this would happen when you were acting up.

283
1150
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:46,190
Are you okay? You have the most on you. What do we do?

284
1154
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,210
Hey, I can just put it in the laundry when I go home.

285
1158
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,280
I'm so sorry!

286
1162
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,710
Why are you doing that?

287
1166
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,460
What's with you?

288
1170
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,370
Hey, did someone put drugs in his?

289
1174
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,570
Ugh, what do I do?

290
1178
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,750
Hey, you're performing.

291
1182
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,000
Just wipe it off quickly.

292
1186
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,390
- Wait, no! You can't do it like that. 
 - What?

293
1191
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,600
This is oily. If you add water, it will spread even more.

294
1195
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,370
Just drop it like this and just that spot like this...

295
1199
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:06,000
Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub. Wash it off.

296
1203
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,360
Tada!

297
1207
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,590
Wow, you're right! Aw, Jae Woo, where did you learn these things?

298
1211
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:22,080
You're so meticulous. That's why I like you!

299
1215
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,180
What the heck... so frustrating.

300
1219
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,580
Oh, Go Dok. Hi.

301
1223
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,830
Hey! Don't you think you're being too much here?

302
1227
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,920
- What? 
 - <i> What?</i>

303
1232
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,900
Ugh, you.

304
1236
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,490
Miss, three glasses of beer, please!

305
1240
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,790
Hi!

306
1244
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,800
What is this? Kissing in the morning as a greeting, a "see you at lunch" kiss, and a goodnight kiss?

307
1248
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,190
I can't even count how many times you guys kissed yesterday and today with all of my ten fingers.

308
1252
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,040
What is she? A pervert? Is she dating you just to kiss you?

309
1256
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,900
What kind of person would date just to kiss someone?

310
1260
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,310
Where else? There are several types of people who date each other.

311
1264
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,670
As for me, I want to date a real sexy woman.

312
1268
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,570
But I also want to date a really cute woman when I see one.

313
1272
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,200
I also want to date an older woman an also a younger woman.

314
1276
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,930
What are you saying? You're crazy.

315
1280
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:31,390
So, what I'm saying is... Everyone has a reason to date someone.

316
1284
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:36,760
Just like how you're dating her because you like her, she has a reason for dating you, too.

317
1288
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,920
A reason.

318
1292
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,920
Ow, hey... my stomach is getting twisted up.

319
1296
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,040
- Oh, man, I have to poop. 
 - That bastard, how gross!

320
1301
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,700
What about the body?

321
1305
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,090
Hey! Of course! It's right that you'd think that.

322
1309
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,990
There's so many people who date just for the physical aspect of it.

323
1313
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,410
I mean, it's not that I don't like it, but...

324
1317
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:20,660
But, I think about it from time to time. Are we just dating to do that kind of thing?

325
1321
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,630
I wonder if I look that easy to him... And I wonder if he even likes me.

326
1325
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,490
I wonder if he's just dating me to touch me.

327
1329
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,370
That bastard! Is he a pervert?

328
1333
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,330
Ugh!

329
1337
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,830
<i> Hey, is she a pervert?</i>

330
1341

331

Wow, it's really a school festival!

332
1349
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,320
It's been so long since I came to one of these!

333
1353
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,760
You worked hard, Ban Do. You lived well!

334
1357
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,740
You're really skilled at making people laugh.

Do you wanna try it once?

341
1385

Yeah! You should.

342
1389
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,520
Oh, a date. How lucky.

345

00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,970
And I can't spot the underclassman anywhere and he's on a date?

346
1405
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:08,030
You punk! You're so lax!

347

Yeah.

Great, it'll be ₩500 for one round.

00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,050
I'll do it for ₩1000.

352

00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,260

No, no! Excuse me!

00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,390
Did you see it?

444
1801
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,710
Look at this! Jae Woo, how can I go to school like this? It's so embarrassing!

445
1805
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,610
No, it was fun!

446
1809
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,840
Fun? That's BS.

447
1813
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,300
Juvenile prostitution...

448
1817
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,150
<i>How could a young guy's gaze look like that?</i>

449
1821
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,610
That playboy.

450
1825
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,030
What? I mean, yes?

451
1829
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,770
Give me one. I didn't have it earlier.

452
1833
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,710
Are you hungry? Here.

453
1837
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,190
Ma Jin Joo!

454
1841
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,750
Why are you so clumsy and have spots on your clothes? Like an ahjumma.

455
1845
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,210
An old woman?

456
1849
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,440
You be good. Don't meddle.

457
1853
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,810
I heard juvenile prostitution is a big issue these days.

458
1857
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,730
Oh-duk ahjussis are all over the place, huh?

459
1861
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,040
Oh-duk ahjussi? What's that?

460
1865
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:07,010
It exists. A pervert who goes for young ladies.

461
1869
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:11,210
Oh, really? These days, older women are the problem.

462
1873
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:15,830
Hostess bars! Women go to places like that and because young guys like them...

463
1877
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,290
they think they got young for real and go crazy.

464
1881
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:24,370
You have to be careful. What appears to the eye is not always true.

465
1885
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,910
What?

466
1889
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,950
What kind of conversation are you two having right now?

467
1893
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:36,390
What's with juvenile prostitution and hostess bar? Were they this close to begin with?

468
1897
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:40,400
I know. They became close very rapidly.

469
1901
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,550
We are <i> not </i> close!

470
1905
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:49,370
Forget it. Hurry up and give us your pork fry. I heard your department food stand is the bomb.

471
1909
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:52,600
We had hidden cooking genius here.

472
1913

Jin Joo!

473
1917
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,210
Jin Joo, our humanities department can't be the only department without a May Queen.

474
1921
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,960
The student body says you're registered in the preliminary. They'll let you enter.

475
1925
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,170
Just do it!

476
1929
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,820
What? She entered the May Queen preliminary?

477
1933
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,500
She was chosen because she's pretty, but she didn't go to the preliminary.

478
1937
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,400
Jin Joo, do it. You're the prettiest in the humanities department.

479
1941
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,230
Just do it.

480
1945
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,480
Ah, I'm not a May Queen.

481
1949
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,630
I'm not the style to put myself out there just anywhere.

482
1953
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:23,040
Can anyone be the May Queen?

483
1957
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,900
Don't go out and get humiliated. Don't do it.

484
1961
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,770
<i> That little...</i>

485
1965
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,200
What's with him?

486
1969
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,980
Humiliation? You're afraid I'd place first place, right?

487
1973
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,640
What?

488
1977
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,370
That's it! First place. Let's do it. You're doing it, okay?

489
1981
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,760
What?

490
1985
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:45,910
I.. Even my clothes are like this.

491
1989
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,470
Maybe next time?

492
1993
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:57,790
What's this? What's with this clothes, Sunbae?

493
1997
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,010
It was in my car.

494
2001
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,470
Car? A girl's clothes?

495
2005
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,430
Yeah. For my younger sister.

496
2009
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:11,980
Yeah, sure.

<i> This shouldn't be... How could I be the May Queen?</i>

498
2017
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:24,300
How could you be the May Queen? It'll be a relief if you get last place.

499
2021
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,210
What are you going to do if I get first place?

500
2025
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,160
What? First place? Ha!

501
2029
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,830
Let's go. Let's try it.

502
2033
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:40,960
Really? Then, I'll prepare accessories in here.

503

Please do well. Our History Major's Queen!

- Wait... 
 - It'd be nice if you place first.

Wait, Sunbae!

You're the fill-in for Humanities, right? History major, class of 99, Ma Jin Joo.

00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,130
Yes.

560

I didn't hear about this.

Yeah. You're right.

Hurry up. You'll lose her.

564

It's a talent show. So, why not do something you do very well? Anything.

565
2288
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,380
I have this kind of talent (Janggi is stomach in Korean).

566
2292
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,010
I don't have any talent to show off.

567

569

You can just choose whatever you're good at.

For example, dancing, singing, or doing impersonations.

 - I like ballet, hip hop, and dancing.

You're right... The things I like...

623
2522
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,590
I don't really have any, so isn't that why you don't know?

624
2526
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:24,970
How could there be nothing that you like? Think about it deeply.

I know... Jin Joo was the prettiest.

633
2562

Aren't you guys just saying this because you're friends with her? She was not the prettiest!

634

There's something I'm very curious about. Can I ask you cautiously?

639

00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,030
Because he's easy.
