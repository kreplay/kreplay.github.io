00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,400
Hello?

6
24
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,260
I can't hear you. I'll call you when I'm outside.

7
28
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,780
No, I'm just bored.

8
32
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,930
Okay, have fun.

9
36
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,430
She's always at the nightclub.

10
40
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,350
I'm just going to eat.

11
44
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,360
Subtracting money for the loan..

12
48
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,240
Maintenance fees..

13
52
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,150
Wow. It's going to be father-in-law's birthday soon. My paycheck even combined with his is not enough.

14
56
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,630
There isn't a day when there's enough money for these living expenses.

15
60
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,370
A lot of money was spent.

Hello, manager! I'm Choi Ban Do, the new employee from Korean Medicine.

20
80
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,000
Please look at our medicine. It's made with good ingredients.

21
84
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,090
Can you look at it just once?

22
88
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,170
<i>And, during the twenties,</i>

23
92
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,240
<i>you have the right to enjoy your youth.</i>

24
96
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,990
<i>The youth that everyone intensely enjoyed...</i>

25
100
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,740
<i>For us, we missed it like not being able to see</i>

30
120
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,490
<i>Before your youth passes by,</i>

31
124
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,390
<i>you should just do what you want.</i>

32
128
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,790
<i>Whether that means playing or going on vacation.</i>

33
132

35
140
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,830
The appetizer's here!

36
144
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,040
You like to drink quickly, don't you?

37
148
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,420
I'm going at a slow speed right now.

38
152
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,880
Very slow.

39
156
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,820
Don't try to match my speed. Drink at your own pace.

40
160
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,250
I'll pour it for you.

41
164
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,800
- What are you doing? 
 - What?

42
169
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,970
You shouldn't pour for a girl, nor should a girl pour for you.

43
173
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,970
Everyone should do it by themselves.

44
177
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,040
Themselves

45
181
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,780
♫ <i> I don't know if I'm drunk. ♫</i>

46
185
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,430
<i> ♫ I don't know if it's a mistake. ♫ </i>

47
189
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:34,840
♫ <i> When it's morning I can't think of anything.  I might be anxious.</i> ♫

48
193
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,170
This song.

49
197
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,860
It sucks.

50
201
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,710
Huh?

51
205
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,300
He's just saying he'll say whatever he wants since he won't remember when he's sober.

52
209
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,970
If it's disadvantageous, they'll choose to forget it. Is it alcohol, Alzheimer's or what?

53
213
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,450
Don't you think so?

54
217
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,940
You're right. I don't like it, either.

55
221
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,340
I really don't like it when people try to pretend they don't remember something. I don't do that.

56
225
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,120
How do I know that? It's our first time meeting.

57
229
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,610
You should drink slower. You might get drunk fast.

58
233
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,040
Cartilage! Buy me cartilage.

59
237
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,740
Come here! Come here!

60
241
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,940
What the!  So unlucky.

61
245
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,430
Ugh! I'm going to kill you.

62
249
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,810
You're a heavy drinker.

63
253
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,660
Boys' Dorms.

64
257
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,300
What is this? Hey! Wake up.

65
261
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,910
Get up! Why are you sleeping here?

66
265
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,290
Why am I here?

67
269
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,480
What is this?

68
273
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,380
What? Oh... Mom!

69
277
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,630
Mom! Look at her eye infection.

70
281
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,300
Hey, don't look at me.

71
285
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,870
You idiots. You're causing a scene early in the morning.

72
289
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,770
Ugh, you.

73
293
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,950
What is this? Why am I the same?

74
297
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,810
Yes!! Yes! I didn't go back!

75
301
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,450
What if it spreads to me? I have a meeting tomorrow for my major.

76
305
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,390
Why does she have a gross eye infection?

77
309
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,280
Hey! Don't get close to me!

78
313
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,360
What's up with her?

79
317
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,030
And why did she sleep in your bedroom?

80
321
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,720
And what's with her eyes?

81
325
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,660
The children I have do not even know how I feel,

82
329
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,380
so how would I know how you guys feel?

83
333
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,260
"To my dear mom"

84
337
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,430
Jin Joo. Is something wrong?

85
341
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,790
Are you upset because of me?

86
345
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,920
There's nothing like that.

87
349
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,050
Oh, also, do you need some allowance?

88
353
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,960
I don't.

89
357
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,260
Did puberty come to her overnight?

90
361
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,060
Why is she doing that to only me?

91
365
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,690
So this means I don't know when I'm going back.

92
369
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,100
I don't know.

93
373
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,880
Wait, I have to serve in the army twice.

94
377
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,710
Wait, no. It's better than being a divorced man.

95
381
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,800
I don't know, I don't know.

96
385
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,980
Looking at it now, this is my old room.

97
389
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,420
My treasures.

98
393
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,650
Ma Jin Joo threw these out when we got married.

99
397
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,620
Oh, the days of being wild!

100
401
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,030
"Days of Being Wild!"

101
405
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,060
Chang Guk Yeong.

102
409
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,830
Look at this.

103
413
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,850
He once knew how to enjoy life.

104
417
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,160
What did you just ask for?

105
421
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,910
Mom, Dad. Get me the installment savings and the house deed.

106
425
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,680
And our assets.

107
429
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,420
All of it.

108
433
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,910
This young, little bastard! You're already doing this?

109
437
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,850
I'm not a young bastard.

110
441
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,840
With that money, I'll multiply it and make you rich.

111
445
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,580
I will be a good son.

112
449
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,380
With that money, if we invest into Gwanggyo and Pangyo,

113
453
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,290
we'll have money to live off of for the rest of our lives.

114
457
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,150
How do you know that?

115
461
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,920
How many times do I tell you? I'm from the future!

116
465
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,540
Oh, I have an answer for this.

117
469
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,810
Oh, darling! Choi Ban Do, you!

118
473
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,140
Dad, this isn't a time for you to be grabbing the back of your neck.

119
477
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,080
You'll live as a rich man for the rest of your life!

120
481
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,240
I'll make that money that you can't earn with your salary.

121
485
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,640
Bring it quickly.

122
489
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,890
Oh, this little...

123
493
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,250
Where are you going?

124
497
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,700
Oh, it's all in your bedroom?

125
501
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,830
Dad! Bring all of it!

126
505
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,530
Mom, should we get a loan?

127
509
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,140
You must be crazy.

128
513
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,650
Hey! Did you get taught something from a con artist?

129
517
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,050
Just wait. You'll see what I mean.

130
521
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,570
Nothing great. You're not going to do anything great.

131
525
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,580
Hey punk!

132
529
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:54,180
Did I ever let you go hungry, or miss a tuition payment with my low income? Huh!

133
533
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,260
Ahhh! Darling!

134
537
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,080
Choi Ban Do come here, huh?!

135
541
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,230
Bring all the assets? How dare you!

136
545
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,710
Dad just trust me!

137
549
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,710
I can't imagine how grateful I was when you were born and I even boiled seaweed soup for your mother.

138
553
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,750
I can't imagine why either.

139
557
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,140
Don't get angry at me. Just believe me, seriously.

140
561
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,120
Believe you, punk? How?

141
565
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,540
What?

142
569
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,910
Did he really sell everything in his room?

143
573
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,500
He is probably going to be causing trouble.

144
577
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,430
Dad. He probably already did.

145
581
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,000
Ah! Youth feels so nice.

146
585
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,550
Ready! Go!

147
589
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,160
🎶

148
593
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,600
Mister stop! Stop the bus! Stop. Stop.

149
597
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,740
Yay! I won!

150
601
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,220
Hey!Choi Ban Do!

151
605
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,720
I won!

152
609
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,900
I need to meet Choi Ban Do first.

153
613
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,940
There's no one who gives a card to a taxi.

154
617
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,630
It worked yesterday. Why doesn't it work?

155
621
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,340
Where would I even charge your card? Is this a department store?

156
625
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,140
Young lady. Young lady, you're not a hardened criminal, are you? Hurry up and pay!

157
629
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,000
No. It definitely worked yesterday.

158
633
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,950
Oh my god. Where did my wallet go?

159
637
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,890
This lady, really!

160
641
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:32,300
Just wait! I really don't have cash.

161
645
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,660
Oh my. It's here It's here.

162
649
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,980
Now I understand.

163
653
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,230
Just let me go.  Just let me get that taxi driver!

164
657
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,490
What is this?

165
661
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,010
Dad will tell Mom to buy you a cell phone.

166
665
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,160
Ah I don't care!

167
669
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,520
Where did Choi Ban Do go?

168
673
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,700
Salute!

169
677
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,360
Hello!

170
681
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,940
Oppa! You seem to be heading to your class...

171
685
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,330
I didn't want to have to see him this morning

172
689
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:05,090
I greeted him after rejecting him in such an awful way. I must have seemed to be a crazy neighborhood lady.

173
693
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,270
He must've thought I was crazy!

174
697
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,510
- What are you doing?
- Oh my god, you surprised me!

175
702
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,280
You're uncomfortable, right?

176
706
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,870
You must not be from the future today.

177
710
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,210
Go. What if he see us here?

178
714
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,180
What are you guys doing here?

179
718
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,690
Hi. I'm the guy from yesterday. Go Dok Jae. That's An Jae Woo.

180
722
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,760
But don't girls usually chat near restrooms?

181
726
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,920
Why are you chatting near the trashcan?

182
730
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,890
Go!Go!

183
734
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,500
Salute!

184
738
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,280
What's with your outfits?

185
742
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,070
Are you supposed to be Bruce Lee?

186
746
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:21,300
It's our major's uniform. Pickled radish color.

187
750
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,350
Pickled Radish? Simple, dumb, insane?

188
754
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,320
- Good sense. 
 - I'm guessing that's from when you got beat up yesterday?

189
759
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,140
- That's exactly right!
 - Oh yeah, I saw.

190
764
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,770
- You should have done something then. 
- Why would I?

191
769
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,970
We're leaving first.Let's go.

192
773
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,840
You! I'll see you later.

193
777
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,520
Me?

194
781
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,990
Why me?

195
785
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,580
Where is Choi Ban Do?

196
789
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,310
As expected, Min Seo Yeong. Your fanclub is here again!

197
793
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,120
Omg, it's Min Seo Yeong!

198
797
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,130
But he didn't come today, the psycho.

199
801
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:29,020
Oh, the civil engineering major?

200
805
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,050
Oh he is here. He came.

201
809
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,330
I'll do it, today!

202
813
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,330
She already saw you... Why did you hide?!

203
817
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,860
Hey! He's coming!

204
821
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,730
That's Min Seo Yeong. She is exactly how I remember her.

205
825
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,840
Like a fairy.

206
829
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,440
<i>Even if you go back in time, you won't be able to seduce her.</i>

207
833
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,520
<i>If I go back, of course I would seduce her. I wouldn't date Ma Jin Joo again.</i>

208
837
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:08,110
That's right. I couldn't date her in the past but, it's different now.

209
841
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,880
Look Min Seo Yeong, the psycho is back.

210
845
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,120
He isn't wearing his uniform today.

211
849
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,910
He's coming!

212
853
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,860
Hello!

213
857
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,350
Yes.

214
861
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,140
I'm sorry about yesterday. You must have been surprised. I also don't know why I did that.

215
865
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,700
My name is Choi Ban Do. I'm a freshman in the civil engineering department. Oh, wait a sec.

216
869
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,270
Drink it well.

217
873
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,410
Oh..thanks.

218
877
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,600
This... here.

219
881
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,380
So they can have some too.

220
885
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,900
See you later.

221
889
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,060
Will you give me your number?

222
893
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,820
Next time, I want to greet you as a friend.

223
897
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,780
Stop lying!

224
901
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,580
You couldn't gather the courage to talk to her for months. This is all a lie.

225
905
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,410
Give me that!

226
909
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,820
Okay...try calling her!

227
913
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,270
You didn't know we'll do this right? What will you do?

228
917
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,200
Hello? Who is this?

229
921
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,710
Hey!Hey!....It's her!!!

230
925
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,300
Wow!

231
929
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,000
So cool!

232
933
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,850
Hey, you, you, you!

233
937
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,790
What?

234
941
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,880
You seriously ... you seriously did this?

235
945
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,340
You were able to ta..talk, to to ..her, when you normally can't talk to her?

236
949
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,850
Why are you stuttering? How else would I have gotten it? Sign language?

237
953
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,770
I am telling you the me now is not the me back in the day.

238
957
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,300
With age, I've gotten wiser. I also have a young body that is as strong as...

239
961
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,930
Iron Man's armor.

240
965
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:08,410
What are you talking about? What was... Ok fine.

241
969
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,470
What about a confession?

242
973
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,510
Yes, yes, did you do that? Confess?

243
977
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,620
What are you guys talking about? What confession?

244
981
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:21,030
Even in love, they say there are stages that must be passed first.

245
985
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,790
Bro, is Min Seo Yeong out of her mind?

246
989
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,540
She has a whole list of guys that want to date her.

247
993
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,990
Just go tell her you like her and get this over with.

248
997
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,070
You guys are saying some weird things.

249
1001
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,930
Why would I confess my feelings if I am not going to date her?

250
1005
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,880
You should only confess to a girl when you know you have a chance with.

251
1009
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,530
You know nothing about dating. Idiots!

252
1013
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,940
Know nothing? Know nothing!

253
1017
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,010
Hey! Have you seen me when I wake up? Have you seen me upset?

254
1021
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,000
Shut up, you are embarrassing me.

255
1025
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,210
We aren't inadequate!

256
1029
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:16,410
It hurts. Why am I talking to these kids?

257
1033
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,170
I should not talk to them.

258
1037
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,320
I'm feeling down after that.

259
1041
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,480
It's so bitter. Why does my mom keep giving me bitter things?

260
1045
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,280
My mom is so mean.

261
1049
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,810
Hey! Why would you throw this away. Do you not know how good this is?

262
1053
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:40,410
Give it here, I'll drink it.

263
1057
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,740
Hey, Ma Jin Joo was looking for you.

264
1061
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,410
Ma Jin Joo? For me? Why? Forget it.

265
1065
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:53,010
She is just doing this to pick at what I said.

266
1069
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:57,060
She always been gutsy.

267
1073
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,800
I'm hungry. Let's go out for tteobokki. (<i>spicy rice cakes</i>)

268
1077
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,670
Hey!

269
1081
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,440
Oh!

270
1085
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,510
Hey! We need to talk. Come with me.

271
1089
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,000
Aigoo, class is going to start. We need to get ready, hurry, hurry, hurry.

272
1093
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,700
I said come out with me. I have something to say.

273
1097
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,970
To me? You have something to talk about? 
 I have nothing to talk about.

274
1102
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,710
Hey!

275
1106
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,510
Class is going to start. Take a seat.

276
1110
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,890
Go.

277
1114
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,960
We'll talk later!

278
1118
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,980
Did something happen? She wasn't upset earlier.

279
1122
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,850
Oh my, she is scary. Seems like laser beems are coming out of her eyes.

280
1126
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,510
Don't worry about it.

281
1130
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,790
Perhaps, she has anger issues? Something like that?

282
1134
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:10,780
Anger issues? What's that? 
 A condition where you can't handle your anger.

283
1139
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,180
Don't get your life entangled with mine.

284
1143
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,400
It's starting.

285
1147
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,010
In the paper that is getting handing out right now, write

286
1151
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,690
your observations on a person in the class.

287
1155
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,430
What are they thinking?

288
1159
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,450
What is on their mind. This is an anonymous project.

289
1163
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,640
<i>Observed classmate : </i>

290
1167
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:44,770
<i> Choi Ban Do</i>

291
1171
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,940
You all got your own papers right?

292
1175
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,630
Yes.

293
1179
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,370
This is how others see you.

294
1183
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,160
How do you feel?

295
1187
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,840
<i> Go Dok Jae: </i>

296

<i>Do you think you are in a rock band? Disgusting, fake hair, , </i>

297
1195
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,310
<i> Get a hair cut and join the army. </i>

298
1199
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,830
Aigoo, seems that friend is shocked.

299
1203
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:23,120
<i> Choi Ban Do: Poophead, stingy with money, coward. Tightwad,Tightwad, Tightwad,</i>

300
1207
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,450
Tightwad, tightwad, tightwad!

301
1211
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,810
- What is this? 
 - Why don't we talk for a bit.

302
1216
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,920
Aigoo. We will be late for class.

303
1220
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,820
We have something to talk about.

304
1224
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,940
We do? I have nothing to talk about with you.

305
1228
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,710
You really! Come with me.

306
1232
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,170
Ouch! That hurts!

307
1236
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,550
What is that?

308
1240
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,520
Is that was is called "crazy love" or something like that?

309
1244
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,930
What's going on?

310
1248
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,420
I don't know.

311
1252
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:24,000
Wow! You really had me deceived.

312
1256
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,380
You should become an actress. You are better than Jeon Do Yeon. You should give it a try.

313
1260
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,580
Should I?

314
1264
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:37,120
Why you little! Forget it. 
 Since when did you know?

315
1269
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,310
You were going to go around pretending you don't know. You are seriously a scary woman.

316
1273
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,460
I am the one who should be saying that!

317
1277
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,950
"You should study." "Gold Miss?" Did I torture you?

318
1281
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,810
You are the one who ate me alive! You tightwad.

319
1285
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,930
Wow! so scary.

320
1289
00:25:54,930 --> 00:26:02,810
It is so scary to hear these things come out of that face.  It's so terrifying.

321
1293
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,690
What are you doing?

322
1297
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,810
Can't you tell?

323
1301
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,460
I am consoling myself for living so long with such a scary woman.

324
1305
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,480
So petty!

325
1309
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,750
I was always petty.  Do you know it now?

326
1313
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,380
Why, why, why?  Is it the first time you see a petty man?

327
1317
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,180
Forget it. What is going on? Why did we come here?

328
1321
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,400
How am I supposed to know?

329
1325
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,110
I thought I'll go back after sleeping,

330
1329
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:29,580
I thought it was a one day thing, but I didn't go back.

331
1333
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,380
I don't know if we will stay here forever.

332
1337
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,020
Forever!

333
1341
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,440
I would be thankful.

334
1345
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,210
What?

335
1349
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,550
Everything would be terrible if we went back. Think about it.

336
1353
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:46,850
We went to bed and woke up to a nice surprise.We went to sleep and woke up.  We are young. We are twenty year olds. Big thank you!

337
1357
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,980
If we go back we are a divorced man and woman.

338
1361
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,530
And are very old. Do you want to go back to that?

339
1365
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,910
Who said I want to go back?

340
1369
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,640
Exactly.

341
1373
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,140
Since it turned out this way, I will just live my life.

342
1377
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,710
Let's just live our lives as strangers. We don't want to mess with each other, right?

343
1381
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:06,180
We don't want to mess with each other, right?

344
1385
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,770
Of course, that is what I want to say.

345
1389
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,920
Exactly. Alright.

346
1393
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,750
Good bye, young lady.

347
1397
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,480
Yes, good bye.

348
1401
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,980
Fighting!

349
1405
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,070
<i> What is this? We both came back together? Why?</i>

350
1409
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,890
<i> Was I too much?</i>

351
1413
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,120
<i> Let's get divorced. We are too unhappy.</i>

352
1417
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,060
<i> I am very upset.</i>

353
1421
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,350
<i>Whatever, it's better this way. She said she was unhappy.</i>

354
1425
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,150
<i>Now that it turned out like this, I'm just going to live my life.</i>

355
1429
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,820
<i>Let's just live as strangers.</i>

356
1433
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,410
<i>If I get to be young again, I would have no other wish.</i>

357
1437
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:15,310
It sounds like nagging to you guys. But when you get to my age you will understand.

358
1441
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,480
You get to do all that you want.

359
1445
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,480
This time never repeats itself.

360
1449
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,850
Youth will not wait for you.

361
1453
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:32,310
Alright, write up a bucket list for things you want to do.

362
1457
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:49,280
<i>Bucket list </i>

363
1461
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:56,110
Hey! Hey! Let's go play.

364
1465
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,920
Why are you just sitting here?

365
1469
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,770
We are playing right now.

366
1473
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,090
No one has as much time as we do.

367
1477
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,810
What's wrong?

368
1481
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,850
I mean let's go out and do something.

369
1485
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,880
Ugh, I've been tired since my morning classes.

370
1489
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,210
These young ones!

371
1493
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:22,740
Tired? You guys think your strength and fitness will last forever, right?

372
1497
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,630
Ok, what do you want to do? Tell me.

373
1501
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,500
What do kids do these days?

374
1505
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,550
Why do you talk like that? Are you Seol's mom?

375
1509
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:40,410
Mom,  kids nowadays go out to drink in,

376
1513
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,540
Nightclubs.

377
1517
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,110
Nightclubs?

378
1521
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,050
I want to go.

379
1525
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,690
What? You want to go to a nightclub?

380
1529
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:54,250
Yes. Those nightclubs that you hang out at every night.

381
1533
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,600
I only went twice.

382
1537
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,240
Wow. She said she would not go even once.  This is the biggest deviation dreamed of in Ma Jin Joo's 20 year life which will wallop the world.

383
1541
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,900
Then, just once

384
1545
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,650
shall we go for it?

385
1549
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:52,890
I told you we should've worn lower heels!

386
1553
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:56,610
I wasn't expecting a downhill path.

387
1557
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,330
Let's go.

388
1561
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,630
Hey! Hey! Omo!

389
1565
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,160
Move, move, move.

390
1569
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,010
Move.

391
1573
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,530
Omo, move! Move!

392
1577
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,650
You there, move! Move!

393
1581
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,530
<i> ♫ I'm thinking I'm in love ♫</i>

394
1585
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:09,270
You should get off me now. Since I smell.

395
1589
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,390
This is my first time wearing such high heels...

396
1593
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,130
It's too steep right?...but you don't smell-

397
1597
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,500
Should I...

398
1601
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,700
I am sorry.

399
1605
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,070
What is she really!

400
1609
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,170
Why did he have to be standing there of all places?

401
1613
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:54,400
That's what I say.  This is not a matter of opinion, it's true, really.

402
1617
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:04,230
That was coincidence.  We should stand there too.

403
1621
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,940
That is a good idea.

404
1625
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:20,300
♬ <i> Come back to me. Come back to me. </i> ♬

405
1629
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,530
♬ <i> Come back to me. I  did everything wrong.  </i> ♬

406
1633
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,510
He's really handsome. 
 ♬ <i> Don't stop talking to me anymore. </i> ♬

407
1638
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,620
What is the occasion that made you come to a nightclub?

408
1642
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,530
If not now, when would we come?

409
1646
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:44,450
Exactly, if not now, when would we come? We should live every day for that day.

410
1650
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,410
Hey!Seol ..don't wear your glasses, you're prettier without them!

411
1654
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,140
You put on some make up!

412
1658
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,580
I am! Hey!guys this is your dark history...right?

413
1662
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,690
What? Dark history?

414
1666
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,890
What is she saying?

415
1670
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,250
We did we walk around like that back then?

416
1674
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,410
Everyone did their makeup like this

417
1678
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,110
I know... All the pictures from back then are all like that.

418
1682
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:18,070
When I was 20 years old how could the photos be more important than the present. You look older.

419
1686
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,830
That's our dark past.

420
1690
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,200
♬ <i>  Come back to me. Come back.</i> ♬

421
1694
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,450
♬ <i> Come back to me.  I did everything wrong. </i> ♬

422
1698
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:36,370

423
1702
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,780
♬ <i>  Come back to me. (Come back to me)</i> ♬

424
1706
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,900
Yes, did you call?

425
1710
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:48,270
Hey! Put that down. That is to call a waiter. 
 Do you want to announce that you never came here before.

426
1715
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:53,230
Ah! This is your first time..then why don't you try booking?

427
1719
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,150
Booking? Let's go!

428
1723
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,260
Her attitude is refreshing. Good. Let's go!

429
1727
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,980
Okay. Let's go.

430
1731
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,930
I only came to dance today.

431
1735
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,990
Then why would you come to a nightclub alone?

432
1739
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,850
Come this way.

433
1743
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:21,200
Yeah, I'm still at the library.  Just because I'm in med school doesn't mean I'm a doctor yet.

434
1747
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,090
I should study hard and spend a sleepless night.

435
1751
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,340
Do not worry about me, have a good night, Princess.

436
1755
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,730
Sleep well.

437
1759
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,380
Did you put the princess to sleep?

438
1763
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,720
That girl doesn't sleep.  Even miserable, she doesn't, really.

439
1767
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,540
Do you see any girls?

440
1771
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,950
How is she?

441
1775
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,670
She is clearly my style, tough.

442
1779
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:06,080
Tough girls aren't easy to control. Get an easy one.

443
1783
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,970
Carefully, carefully. This way.

444
1787
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,950
My god, how long has it been since we came to a nightclub?

445
1791
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,000
How old are we?

446
1795
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,930
Life is too full of ups and downs.

447
1799
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,860
Put a red label on today.

448
1803
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,450
I learn to play by watching youngsters.

449
1807
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:39,330
Got it? So why don't we get some liquor today?

450
1811
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,860
- No that's expensive. 
 Right?

451
1816
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:47,170
Hey, do it. This hyung has lots of money, order it!

452
1820
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,350
Let's go all out today!

453
1824
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,000
Okay! Shall we play?

454
1828
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,970
Do not pour drinks for anyone.

455
1832
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:03,090
If you you like them, pour hard liquor. If not, pour beer only.

456
1836
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:08,810
Ahn Jae Woo! Don't pour good stuff for a bomb. Get it?

457
1840
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,090
Ok, why are you telling me that?

458
1844
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,450
Okay!

459
1848
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:31,270
I want hard liquour. Beer upsets my stomach.

460
1852
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,750
What's your major again? 
 Civil engineering. 


461
1858
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,370
What do you do?

462
1862
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:58,210
It's studying to become knowledgeable in the theory and practice of

463
1866
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:03,670
planning, designing, constructing structures, and maintaining buildings.

464
1870
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:07,030
Actually, my dad was a carpenter so,

465
1874
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:12,440
but even my father's dream was not to be a carpenter. I wanted to do this ..

466
1878
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,300
I have more! What is it when a pig farts?

467
1882
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,460
Pig?  Pig fart?

468
1886
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,200
Donkasu  (<i> "Pig gas" -- Donkatsu is a pork cutlet</i>

469
1890
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:30,410
So what is it when the pig sits down? Donbangseok!  (<i>Pig sits down is pun for money talks)</i>

470
1894
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,410
Oppa, you are so funny!

471
1898
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,290
Let's stop here.

472
1902
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,360
Let's go out.

473
1906
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,810
It's ok. If we don't do this now, when would we?

474
1910
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,320
- Nice to meet you. 
 - The same.

475
1915
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,960
- How old are you? 
 -Thirty eigh...

476
1920
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,920
Do I look like I'm in my 30's?

477
1924
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,060
I am sure you're not underage so~ 20 years old?

478
1928
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,940
She looks like a little kid. So cute.

479
1932
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,540
I am 26, so I am an oppa.

480
1936
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,710
Seems like it.

481
1940
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,270
Who said you can shorten your speech with my friend?

482
1944
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,540
Sorry if I offended you.

483
1948
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:37,440
Not at all. It is ok. You can lower your speech.

484
1952
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,770
Oppa.

485
1956
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,470
It's cute.

486
1960
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:46,440
Wow, you are totally my style.

487
1964
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,950
You probably can't drink really well since you are young.

488
1968
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:53,710
You get better at drinking as you get older.

489
1972
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,140
Here.

490
1976
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,380
Let's go out. It's techno.

491
1980
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,940
Can't we just play in here.

492
1984
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,410
- Come quickly. Let's go. 
 Let's go.

493
1989
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,030
Hurry.

00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,400

513

00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,570
Hey!

514
2074
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,390
What is this? You came to a nightclub!

515
2078
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,880
Act your age, you ahjumma!

516
2082
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,740
Are you the only one living a new life?  Have you found the perfect life?

517
2086
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,470
How did you hold back for so long?

518
2090
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:38,720
I know right? How did I live like that? I will live my life.

519
2094
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,660
You think you can attract men like that?

520
2098
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,420
Get your senses back together, you Ahjumma.

521
2102
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,510
Jeez.

522
2106
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,080
That jerk!

523
2110
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,510
<i>Omo!</i>

524
2114
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:05,140
<i>You there! Get out of the way!!</i>

525
2118
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,420
Why are you just standing here. What are you thinking about?

526
2122
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,380
It's nothing.

527
2126
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,310
But, you...

528
2130
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,430
Have you ever hugged anyone?

529
2134
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,440
What? Hug someone?

530
2138
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,940
I mean, a girl?

531
2142
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,810
Never mind. It's late, let's go.

532
2146
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,480
What the.

533
2150
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,580
Did something happen between you and Ma Jin Joo?

534
2154
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,200
Why is she making a fuss about coming in here?

535
2158
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,630
I know, I think it is your fault. Seems like she hates you.

536
2162
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,480
I also think so.

537
2166
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,350
<i> I can't drink with Yoon Bo Reum.</i>

538
2170
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,340
<i> OK, don't drink.</i>

539
2174
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:13,490
Hey Yoon Bo Reum, you must not be a good drinker.

540
2178
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,210
Women should not be good at holding their drinks.

541
2182
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,530
If a girl drinks better than a boy, well, you know.

542
2186
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:22,320
It's totally not good, right?

543
2190
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,650
What?

544
2194
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,030
Stop it. Stop it!

545
2198
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,500
What? You agree?

546
2202
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,220
I was having a good time, why did he have to show up?

547
2206
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:48,110
Tada. Good job, Ma Jin Joo.

548
2210
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:55,680
Let's go one time.

549
2214
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,810
I won't do it.

550
2218
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:57,740
Aish.Just once!

551
2222
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,110
I said I don't want to.

552
2226
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:08,280
Here, here. Me!

553
2230
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,380
You are the best! I lost!

554
2234
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,910
You can challenge me anytime.

555
2238
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:28,950
but we aren't done yet.

556
2242
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:34,100
What's up with you? Why are you laughing?

557
2246
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,880
It's cute.

558
2250
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,650
Today is really ...

559
2254
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,680
Do you want to go up against me?

560
2258
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:49,340
No, not at all. Don't misunderstand. You are good at drinking, much better than myself.

561
2262
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,580
I said I would see you again, and here we are.

562
2266
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,400
You!

563
2270
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,700
Me?

564
2274
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,280
Do you remember yesterday? Or do you not?

565
2278
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,280
You better answer properly.

566
2282
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:17,620
Yes, I think I probably remember.

567
2286
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:21,050
You think?  Let's say you said you do.

568
2290
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,220
That is...

569
2294
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,940
Then make sure you keep the promise you made me.

570
2298
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,980
Promise?

571
2302
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,990
Your friend is really drunk.

572
2306
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,450
What is going on?

573
2310
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,000
I think she is drunk.

574
2314
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,810
Mic test.

575
2318
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,600
Mic test.

576
2322
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,760
She must have lost it.

577
2326
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,810
She must have lost it. Hey! Ma Jin Joo!

578
2330
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,320
Bo Reum, come here.

579
2334
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:10,040
This woman is over doing it.

580
2338
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,390
She can't even drink. Why would she get so drunk?

581
2342
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,040
You scrooge!

582
2346
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,750
There she goes.

583
2350
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,780
Come over here, you scrooge! Scrooge.

584
2354
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:27,300
Scrooge!

585
2358
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:34,320
I said come down here. Are you the only great one! I'm good too.

586
2362
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,420
I got a guy's number because I am pretty.

587
2366
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:47,980
I am the best!

588
2370
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,040
The oppa that gave me his number, right?

589
2374
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,840
Director Park?

590
2378
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,480
I will call you.

591
2382
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,990
Ma Jin Joo seriously?

592
2386
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:11,210
You don't even know what kind of bastard he is.

593
2390
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:17,880
Hey! Tightwad. Because of you

594
2394
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,410
my life turned into a dog's life.

595
2398
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,010
But what about Seo Jin?

596
2402
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,380
Seo Jin.

597
2406
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,210
What will you do about him?

598
2410
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,590
Huh.

599
2414
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,180
Has she lost her mind?

600
2418
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,700
What is this?

601
2422
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:24,400
Scrooge! I am talking about you.

602
2426
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,090
Get out of here.

603
2430
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:01,960
Put me down.

604
2434
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,730
you and your long hair!

605
2438
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:06,430
Don't you ever come here again.

606
2442
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,940
That ahjussi is really drunk.

607
2446
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,520
Ahjussi, go sleep at home. You will twist your face here.

608
2450
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,610
Get up you idiot.

609
2454
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:23,770
I'm so embarrassed.

610
2458
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:28,350
Who is Seo Jin? Sounded like a guy's name.

611
2462
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,550
Where are you going?

612
2466
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,760
I'll see you tomorrow.

613
2470
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,190
Hold on, how do I deal with him?

614
2474
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:41,200
Ban Do!

615
2478
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,100
I'm so embarrassed.

616
2482
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,190
<i> What will you do about Seo Jin?</i>

617
2486
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:53,200
<i> Seo Jin. What will you do about him?</i>

618
2490
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,450
<i>Are you enjoying yourselves today, fellow students?</i>

619
2494
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,480
<i> There's no doubt it's a spring day.</i>

620
2498
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,750
Let's listen to a song.

621
2502
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:31,030
It's Yang Pa's Ahdio.

622
2506
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,810
- I'm done, I can't hold it in anymore. 
 - Hey! Hey! Hey!

623
2511
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,340
Whatever, I'm going.

624
2515
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:54,480
Are you ok?

625
2519
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,290
Hey, Ma Jin Joo.

626
2523
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,480
What are you doing?

627
2527
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,420
Follow me.

628
2531
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,300
What's with you...Oi!

629
2535
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,730
Why are you acting like you know me?

630
2539
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,370
Why am I acting like I know you?

631
2543
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:18,390
You, do you even know what kind of jerk that guy is?

632
2547
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,550
What about it?

633
2551
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:29,850
Give it to me? 
 What?

634
2556
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:32,780
The number you got from that jerk last night.

635
2560
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,630
You must really think you are 20.

636
2564
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:39,200
Who do you think you are to tell me what to do?

637
2568
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,320
Whether I got a guy's number or not.

638
2572
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,700
you are amazing a woman who has a kid

639
2576
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:51,640
You're doing great getting drunk and causing mess.

640
2580
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:57,140
Seriously do not contact him. He is human trash.

641
2584
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,490
Ajussi! whether I drink or dance..

642
2588
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:06,590
or I meet with trash or not, what does it matter to you?

643
2592
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,770
Ok, as you say we are strangers.

644
2596
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,830
Why do we keep getting entangled?

645
2600
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,980
Do you want to advertise that we got divorced?

646
2604
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:19,190
Why don't you just say we left our kid to start over?

647
2608
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:22,560
Things like this happen when people are drunk.

648
2612
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,080
You think I can't do it? It is a fact after all.

649
2616
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,810
There you go talking about facts.

650
2620
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:33,660
You and I are both in the same boat if people find out.

651
2624
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,420
How are we the same?

652
2628
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:45,180
<i>You and I are both in the same boat if people find out.</i>

653
2632
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:54,330
<i> How are we the same. You are a married man yet you are all over your first love.</i>

654
2636
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,770
<i> Does your first love know? That you're a married man and have a kid?</i>

655
2640
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:01,830
<i> Why am I married? I got divorced.</i>

656
2644
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:06,830
<i> No one here knows that.</i>

657
2648
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:11,780
<i> Then what about you? You have a kid yet you are going for a young guy?</i>

658
2652
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:15,980
<i> You can't get yourself together. That is more outrageous.  You're an ahjumma.</i>

659
2656
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,640
What is going on? Did they both cheat on each other?

660
2660
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,810
They must be crazy.

661
2664
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:23,690
<i> Yesterday? That was an accident.</i>

662
2668
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,400
<i>Don't even think about not paying me the alimony. I'm going to leave you penniless.</i>

663
2672
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,890
<i> I am a student. I can't even afford gum.</i>

664
2676
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,550
<i> I'm a student. A broke student.</i>

665
2680
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:38,270
<i> I can't give it to you. No, I won't give it. Why should I hand over that money?</i>

666
2684
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,280
This is unbelievable.

667
2688
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,820
There is a married student?

668
2692
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,470
You stingy jerk.

669
2696
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:57,740
Why? I thought you liked gum. The price of gum!

<i> Epilogue. 2004.</i>

672
2708
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:15,380
Did you know we ran out of money for this month?

673
2712
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,020
We have to live frugally.

674
2716
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:22,390
What? Already? For the month?  How are we going to get through?

675
2720
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:24,530
How are we going to live?

676
2724
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,410
We can live off of my love.

677
2728
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,330
Right!

678
2732
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,430
What's with you.  Surprising me.

679
2736
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,870
What did you do today?

680
2740
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:45,720
I cleaned, cooked, and worked on our finances.

681
2744
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,420
You. 
 Me?

682
2749
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,240
I achieved something great today.

683
2753
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,840
I am the first newbie to get this many contracts signed so fast! first!

684
2757
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,610
Isn't that great?

685
2761
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,810
Soon you will be the god of sales.

686
2765
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,630
You did a good job!

687
2769
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:16,670
If we didn't get married, what would we be doing now?

688
2773
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:20,940
Probably playing and wasting money like others.

689
2777
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,120
I guess so.

690
2781
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,650
I do wish I had money to waste.

691
2785
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:30,040
Why? Is there something you would like to do?

692
2789
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,190
Yes. You?

693
2793
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,610
Me?

694
2797
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,670
Let's both say it.

695
2801
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,210
1, 2, 3

696
2805
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,130

<i>We turned and turned around. More passionate, stronger.</i>

701
2825
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,910
it found us again.

702
2829

1.Go to a club.

2864
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,840
There is a divorcee student in our school.

711
2868
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:05,510
Is this called a date?

712
2872
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,500
You should've been careful saving someone.

713
2876
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,800
She should take care of herself.

714
2880
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:18,770
But why did you do it suddenly? Asking for my number and coming to visit me...like another person.

715
2884
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:22,700
How silly. Why would I get nervous right there?

716
2888
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,730
I want to get to know you.
