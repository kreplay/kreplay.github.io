00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,200
Oh, Madam. Why are you here without any prior notice?

4
16
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,750
Where is Nurse Kim?

5
20
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,470
Oh, Honey. Why did you come so suddenly?

6
24
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,780
You've arrived, Madam?

7
28
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,210
You can leave.  Ah,  please bring out some hortensia tea that my wife likes so much.

8
32
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,090
Yes.

9
36
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,670
Aiyoo, you came well, Honey.

10
40
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,760
I was so tired, but we must've communicated telepathically.

11
44
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,710
Oh! Ah, really?

12
48
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,100
Yeah. I was thinking that if I could see your face, then I could live.

13
52
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,930
How did you come at such a perfect time?

14
56
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,770
Ah, I came well.

15
60
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,410
I missed you, Honey.

16
64
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,900
You should stay a while before you leave.

17
68
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,660
- No, it's okay. Go in now.
- Okay, bye.

Who are you to open the door so?

42
169
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,140
I asked, what are you?

43
173
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,080
Me?

44
177
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,050
I'm... her...

45
181
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,640
Friend. Yeah, friend.

46
185
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,700
What are you?

47
189
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,080
What nonsense.

48
193
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,850
Move. I have to change my clothes.

49
197
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,200
What? You have to change your clothes? Here? Together?

50
201
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:53,040
Are you crazy? What are you thinking about?

51
205
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,740
Hurry and leave. You're driving me mad.

52
209
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,240
She's gone properly crazy. Truly insane.

53
213
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,120
Does she really think she's 20 or what?

54
217
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,060
Hey.

55
221
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,110
"Hey"?

56
225
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,980
Did you just say "hey" to me?

57
229
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,300
Ma Jin Joo. You just heard him, right?

58
233
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,280
You young one who hasn't even come in contact with a dog tag yet...

59
237
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,300
He said "hey". "Hey".

60
241
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,280
You've really softened up over the years Choi Ban Do.

61
245
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,810
Aren't you a freshman? Have you taken the CSAT, oh say, five times?

62
249
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,540
That's not it.

63
253
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,930
You know even in poop, I've pooped at least 10 million times more than you have.

64
257
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,220
You're so dirty.

65
261
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,260
Don't pay attention to him. Here. Take it.

66
265
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,220
You should put it back nicely in your car so that your younger sister doesn't find out.

67
269
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,970
The tag wasn't even cut off.

68
273
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,290
Nonsense. Younger sister?

69
277
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,370
Hey. What kind of brother carries his younger sister's clothes in his car?

70
281
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,630
I see right through you. You bought it for a girl.

71
285
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,740
You're right.

72
289
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,080
I bought it for you.

73
293
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,010
What? Me?

74
297
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,570
Wear it well. I'm leaving.

75
301
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,020
What is that expression? Is he laughing at me?

76
305
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,310
That little punk...

77
309
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,940
- Hey.
- What?

78
314
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,310
You're much littler. Haven't you ever seen a mirror?

79
318
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:19,540
Right. Life is so good since you're trying to live a new life with a tall and sexy guy, right?

80
322
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,500
Wait--

81
326
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,760
Why are you crying even when you're eating something expensive?

82
330
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,600
Hm? I bought the most expensive one.

83
334
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,720
Don't cry now.

84
338
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,640
Choi Ban Do, this bastard-like bastard.

85
342
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:21,250
Choi Ban Do. You bad bastard. I ought to just! Just!

86
346
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,620
She truly has a drunk personality. It's one where she talks about others behind their back.

87
350
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,660
Seol. You should stop drinking.

88
354
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:36,010
Hey. I can't not drink this alcohol.

89
358
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:42,060
Why? Because our Jin Joo is so pitiful.

90
362
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,860
You have some sense.

91
366
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,540
This?

92
370
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,180
You know a bit. It's from Italy.

93
374
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,460
There's not a lot of this model in Korea.

94
378
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,370
But, girls usually don't know this.

95
382
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,040
I'm not usual. I probably have more guy things than you.

96
386
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,350
As expected, Bo Reum has a lot of men.

97
390
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,560
You're pretty well off, right?

98
394
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,250
Oh you can tell? I try to hide my upbringing, but you can tell?

99
398
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,660
Aigoo, I can't compliment you at all.

100
402
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,700
What? Where'd it go? Where'd my appetizers go?

101
406
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,230
The appetizers are in your stomach.

102
410
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,630
I did? Really?

103
414
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,900
Did An Jae Woo ditch or what? Why isn't he here?

104
418
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,560
♬  <i> My love is leaving me. </i>  ♬ (Kim Gun Mo - <i> Love is Gone)</i>

107
430
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,130
<i> Because he's easy.</i>

108
434
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,710
♬  <i> Was I just expecting too much? ♬</i>

109
438
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,680
Are you crying because of love?

110
442
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,560
The solution for you who has been crying and laughing because of love.

111
446
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,130
She did not fall for you. Again, today,

112
450
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,470
Here with us today to cleanly solve your problems, Bro's Leader,

113
454
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,610
Lee Sang Min. Please say hello.

114
458
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,490
Hello, Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Sang Min.

115
462
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,770
It's the end of May, but you've decided to wear fur?

116
466
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,370
Yes, since I've been trying to emulate the East Coast style.

117
470
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,980
- What? Where? 
 -The East Coast. 
 - Ah I see.

118
476
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,040
You look hot. It's a headache whether you're in or out of love.

119
480
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,120
I wonder who today's caller is. Let me connect. Hello?

120
484
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,210
<i>Hello, I'm Tinkerbell from Seoul.</i>

121
488
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,480
Oh, you're a fairy, Tinkerbell.

122
492
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,200
So shall we have a listen to what your concern is?

123
496
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,700
<i>There's someone that I'm meeting. That person really likes physical intimacy.</i>

124
500
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,980
Every time we meet we kiss,

125
504
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,480
<i>touch, and kiss again.</i>

126
508
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,740
I feel like oh maybe it's for that intimacy that we're meeting.

127
512
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,630
But you know a kiss is something that's shared because you like each other.

128
516
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,920
But does the person touch a particular place? That's important.

129
520
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,130
Mostly my buttocks.

130
524
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:21,890
Your behind? That's quite deep. So your bottom is being touched, I see.

131
528
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,590
How about talking it about it with your significant other? I'm sure that's not the reason why...

132
532
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:32,300
I did ask! That person's going out with me because I'm easy.

133
536
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,380
How can that person say that outright?

134
540
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,980
It wasn't said to me, directly per se.

135
544
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,540
So if we are to summarize, your significant other, Tinkerbell

136
548
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,840
touches you everyday on your behind.

137
552
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,900
And the reason that you guys are together is because you're easy. Is that correct?

138
556
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,280
<i>Yes.</i>

139
560
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,340
This is a bit much. I would almost hope you broke up immediately.

140
564
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,670
Wait. No, this isn't it.

141
568
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,550
It's a dangerous world right now. That boy's a jerk.

142
572
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,060
He said that so directly. The times have changed.

143
576
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,360
Even if he might seem charming now, this might end up being a huge problem in the future.

144
580
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,800
<i>Does that person also like to drink?</i>

145
584
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,380
How did you know?

146
588
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,610
That's the way it is. I like girls, no women.

147
592
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,330
They like everyone. They're like that.

148
596
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,230
Right. He's probably meeting a lot of girls.

149
600
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,750
<i>Tinker Bell, you might also be one of them.</i>

150
604
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,830
No way.

151
608
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,520
I'm an expert in that field, so just trust me. Break up with him.

152
612
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,620
Miss Tinker Bell, good luck!

153
616
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,210
Miss? I'm a mister.

154
620
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,140
Hello?

155
624
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,310
But, how could he say that outright to his girlfriend?

156
628
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,250
Hyung, I'm worried about you. As it is, you're old and live alone.

157
632
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,300
You have to marry someone quickly to have a kid. It's not like you're Superman.

158
636
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,530
I assure you, I will marry before you do.

159
640
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,740
- You? 
 - Of course. 
 - Want to bet?

160
646
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,380
Fine, deal. But I won't count it if you get married and then divorce.

161
650
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,780
- I think you have to count that.
- Why?

162
655
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,340
Once someone marries, you don't know what'll happen in the future. The beginning is the most important.

163
659
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,370
- The end result isn't important.
- You're talking like someone who has had a lot of experience. Fine, fine.

164
664
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,810
Anyway, Miss Tinker Bell can't meet a boy like that.

165
668
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,400
<i>[Oppa ♥]</i>

166
672
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,410
Oh, hi.

167
676
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,300
Next week?

168
680
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,320
Okay, let's meet up.

169
684
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,350
<i> Hi, I'm Park Hyeon Seok, the medical major you saw at the nightclub.</i>

170
688
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,410
<i> Are you free today?</i>

171
692
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,250
<i> Let's meet again.</i>

172
696
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,120
<i> It seems like you're just happy and excited because a boy gave you his number.</i>

173
700
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,870
<i> Director Park is just playing with a girl like you.</i>

174
704
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,280
<i>I called dibs on her. Don't get involved.</i>

175
708
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,680
<i> I'll hand her over when I get bored with her. Just wait.</i>

176
712
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,300
Other people ponder whether or not they should go to that concours once in a year.

177
716
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,040
This is already my third time this year, Mom.

178
720
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,860
I can also have a slump.

179
724
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,860
How can I always think about ballet and not rest?

180
728
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,330
I'm exhausted!

181
732
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,370
It's not easy to live as a kid or as an adult.

182
736
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,640
Right?

183
740
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,540
Did you hear me?

184
744
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,310
Just leave your house.

185
748
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,880
"I'm going to to leave with the wind." And you just run away from home. How's that?

186
752
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,620
What? Am I a high schooler? I'm not a kid, why would I run away from home?

187
756
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,860
You are a kid. You still have to grow a lot.

188
760
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,890
Now you're smiling. I just said it for you to smile, that's all.

189
764
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,440
Yeah, thanks to you, I'm smiling.

190
768
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,760
Hold on.

191
772
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,610
Hello?

192
776
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,630
Hey, where are you?

193
780
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,010
Ma Jin Joo?

194
784
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,270
Where are you? Hey, who really is this Park Hyeon Seok boy?

195
788
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,270
Did he do something to you?

196
792
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,620
Where are you? Stay where you are. I'll be right there.

197
796
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,540
Something urgent came up. I'll be going now.

198
800
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,040
What? Oh. Okay.

199
804
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,620
Where are you?

200
808
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,470
You're really not going?

201
812
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,740
- What? 
 - Medical Student's Night.

202
817
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,620
You're supposed to introduce your girlfriend there. I've noticed you don't go every year.

203
821
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,900
I have to study. Instead of showing our relationship to others,

204
825
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,340
I should graduate quickly. I want to be more fitting for your household.

205
829
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,050
<i> How could I take you there? Have you not seen yourself in the mirror?</i>

206
833
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,620
Don't be cautious of my household.

207
837
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,370
It only matters if I like you or not. Would my dad need a doctor as his son-in-law?

208
841
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,580
<i> I need your dad.</i>

209
845
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,330
I think I'll have to ask my dad to buy another car.

210
849
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,810
It's hard to go from place to place while having to study. It'll be tiring.

211
853
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,520
Don't do that.

212
857
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,930
I'm already selfish for accepting that free room from you, if you continue to do this, I can't date you.

213
861
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,930
Do you think I'm dating you because I want a car?

214
865
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,500
<i>How are you try to compensate me with a car.</i>

215
869
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,410
You're too nice...

216
873
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,730
That trash-like bastard.

217
877
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,830
So, he got a hospital after seducing a rich woman,

218
881
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,830
and then he played around and cheated?

219
885
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,650
Played around?

220
889
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,080
- Hey, you should be careful of what you say with that face.
- Did I say something wrong?

221
894
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,550
Anyway, that future wife is his girlfriend now. Then what about his advances towards me?

222
898
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,580
<i> If I get bored with her, I'll give her to you. Just wait.</i>

223
902
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,080
- Am I second?
- Then would you be the first?

224
907
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,990
He approached you just so he could play with you one time.

225
911
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,360
He has so many more of those kinds of girls. That's why I told you not to get involved with him.

226
915
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,940
But how do you know this in so much detail? You only had a work relationship with him.

227
919
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,030
Well ... just ...

228
923
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,940
Perhaps... were you his errand boy?

229
927
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,960
Err-- Errand boy? Your words a bit harsh. What are you talking about?

230
931
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:52,530
Work relationships are usually like that. Take care of the client's personal matters so that he will--

231
935
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,820
You really did all sorts of things.

232
939
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,840
All sorts of them.

233
943
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,880
<i> -  Did you eat? 
 - No.</i>

234
948
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,850
<i>  - You went this long without eating? 
 - I was busy.</i>

235
953
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,040
<i> Yes, Director. Three boxes by next morning?</i>

236
957
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,980
<i> Yes, sir. Have a good night!</i>

237
961
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,010
What?

238
965
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,640
How much did I drink last night?

239
969
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,410
That bastard.

240
973
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:56,130
Hey. Hey. You left those two scary girls

241
977
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,450
alone with me! You ran away? Get up.

242
981
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,190
Wake up!

243
985
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,220
Turn around. Oh, geez!

244
989
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,800
A frozen corpse, a deep sea fish, what are you?

245
993
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,350
<i> Appetizers.</i>

246
997
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,660
<i> I have to cut it up to eat it.</i>

247
1001
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,390
<i>You can't have beef jerky in his house, really.</i>

248
1005
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,370
<i> Cheon Seol!!</i>

249
1009
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,670
What is this? Gloves? Oh, no! Who did this?

250
1013
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:14,720
Who? Do you not remember? Wow, she's saying she doesn't remember!

251
1017
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,760
But where else can I resolve this unfairness?

252
1021
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,080
Oh no. Yesterday.

253
1025
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,520
Yeah, that's right. After you were drunk yesterday, you...

254
1029
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,980
Look, Cheon Seol.

255
1033
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,550
I'm not saying I'm going to do anything to you. But, when you get drunk...

256
1037
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,600
Yeah, you have bad drinking habits too. You can fix those.

257
1041
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Good luck.

258
1045
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,240
Hey, where are you going?

259
1049
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,230
This is your drinking habit!

260
1053
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,740
She knows. She knows and she's acting like that.

261
1057
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,260
I'm the victim, I'm the victim!

262
1061
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,760
I'm crazy!

263
1065
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,870
That must've been really expensive.

264
1069
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,780
Sorry, Dok Jae. I'll pay you back for sure in the future.

265
1073
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,180
You're doing what? Revenge?

266
1077
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,100
What, for me?

267
1081
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,420
Never mind, I already got revenge on him.

268
1085
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:38,100
I've already gotten a bit of revenge for your sake, too.

269
1089
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,130
What?

270
1093
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,160
<i> Oh, I'm sorry. Please have some of this.</i>

271
1097
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,830
<i> Oh, I thought you were my friend.</i>

272
1101
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,980
That is so like you. Petty revenge. You should punish him properly!

273
1105
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,830
Only you don't have to get involved. Why would I go to such extents?

274
1109
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,940
Also, even a minute and second of youth are so precious. Do you really have the time to waste all of it on him?

275
1113
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,100
Don't you have feelings? You were so mistreated, don't you feel wronged?

276
1117
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:19,190
Why are you like this suddenly? Are you like this because you're upset about how that guy mistreated me?

277
1121
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,630
Right? That's why you want revenge, right?

278
1125
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,880
Do you think that's the only reason?

279
1129
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,720
He put a leash on a girl and led her on.

280
1133
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,080
He hurt a girl's heart by cheating on her.

281
1137
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,340
And, he saw me as a second. He deserves karma.

282
1141
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,200
Okay. What do you want to do?

283
1145
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,610
You looked down on me because I kept watching those melodrama like dramas, right?

284
1149
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,070
I will show what a real melodrama plot is like.

285
1153
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,590
<i> Yes, I'll see you in the afternoon.</i>

286
1157
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,030
If you want to bite the tail of a rat-like bastard, you have to find a way into the rat's hole first.

287
1161
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,560
- But, there's something you have to do before that. 
 - Let's just not get involved, okay?

288
1166
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,830
♬ <i> Lazenca, Save us  ♬  
[N.E.X.T - Lazenca, Save Us (1997)]</i>

289
1171
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,860
What do you want me to do?

290
1175
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,600
You can't go into a rat's hole with nothing. You have to bring what the rat likes.

291
1179
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,800
What he likes? He likes money.

292
1183
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,420
Oh...

293
1187
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,950
What's with you? I'm so lazy.

294
1191
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,840
- Have you heard? 
 - Heard what?

295
1196
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,190
- The granddaughter of Samsung Group attends our school. 
 - Samsung Group?

296
1201
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,250
Hey, don't lie. Why would that rich person come to our school?

297
1205
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:44,740
I'm telling the truth. She must be attending this school secretly to help out the company.

298
1209
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,270
Who is it? Is it someone you know?

This is confirmed information from the student council president.

Ma Jin Joo from the history department.

301

Sorry, I came late. You should've ordered something.

306
1241
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,850
No, it's fine.

307
1245
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,280
Your order?

308
1249
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,910
- I'll have a cold, refreshing lemonade? 
 - I'll have one cup of espresso.

309
1254
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,530
That should be really bitter.

310
1258
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,470
I've gone out to other countries a lot. So, I've had espresso a lot.

311
1262
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,500
Oh, I see. You travel to other countries a lot.

312
1266
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,150
I should probably do that when I graduate. I'll go out and visit other countries.

I wanted to contact you sooner but pre-med has a lot of homework.

315
1278
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,940
Oh, if you're a medical student, there's something called a Medical Student's Night, right?

316
1282
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,860
Yeah. How did you know?

317
1286
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,720
My friend's boyfriend is a medical student. She was bragging about how she was going there.

318
1290
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,070
Do you want to go together?

319
1294
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,900
Really?

320
1298
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,260
Ah, no. You have a girlfriend. How could I go?

321
1302
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,550
I heard from other people. That Kim Ye Rim is your girlfriend.

322
1306
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,750
<i> Darn, where did she hear this from?</i>

323
1310
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:44,240
No, she's not my girlfriend. We dated briefly in the past, but she kept following me around, so.

324
1314
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,080
Well, you never know.

325
1318
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,430
Anyway, since there's someone you have unfinished business with, I don't think I should go.

326
1322
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,350
No, it'll be finished soon. Actually, it's already finished.

327
1326
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,450
Don't worry about it.

328
1330
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,300
Oh, Ma Jin Joo. You're going to get rid of his wife with your own hands I see.

329
1334
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,130
I will cut off his tail.

330
1338
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,260
What did you say right now?

331
1342
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,350
<i> I,</i>

332
1346
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,550
<i> I really like you.</i>

333

00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:22,520
<i>As it is he is sewage. He's done so much hard work.</i>

334
1354
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,410
Will that smart kid abandon her?

335
1358
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,290
Naturally if there is anything fishy, it's going to sting more.

336
1362
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:31,730
Whatever the gift, we should be on the offensive. We aim for the head, not the tail.

337
1366
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,590
So, you're really going to Medical Student's Night with him?

338
1370
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,900
As for any affairs that happen in the world, what must you catch?

339
1374
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,820
I know this. The scene of the crime.

340
1378
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,330
- Hey, you. 
 - Yes?

341
1383
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,050
- Have you not seen Ahn Jae Woo? 
 - He didn't come today.

342
1388
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,360
What is this? He hasn't even been answering my calls.

343
1392
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,800
Did you drop something? Money? Do you want me to look for it with you?

344
1396
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,760
No.

345
1400
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,510
- Let's go. 
 - Where?

346
1405
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:39,920
- Let's drink. 
 - No, but I don't really feel like drinking.

348

Are you reciting a Buddhist chant? What is it? You're bumping your nose on the beer.

349
1418
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:52,730
You have something worrying you, right? Tell me, this noona will listen.

350
1422
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,190
Hey....

351
1426
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,210
Hold on, I have to use the restroom.

352
1430
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,950
Wait a little bit.

353
1434
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,460
Yeah. Just let her know directly.

354
1438
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,800
I won't know the truth until I hear it directly from her.

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,070
<i> No, I was just wondering.</i>

426
1729
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:05,200
<i>It seems someone's playing a trick on me.</i>

427
1733
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,610
<i>Who? Who's doing that to you?</i>

428
1737
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,830
Samsung Group doesn't have a granddaughter. Are you a boy?

429
1741
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,980
Do I have to check?

430
1745
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,180
Samsung Group? Who said I'm the granddaughter?

431
1749
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,040
Your friend.

432
1753
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,370
I was pushed into the pool a while ago because of him.

433
1757
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:36,940
I thought about it, and I realized that I'd talked about you before.

435
1765
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,360

00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,030
Yeah. You said he has a lot of girls.

444
1802
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,630
If we're going to catch him in the act, we shouldn't leave any holes where he can escape through.

00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,090

00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,230
<i> Okay. Call me again.</i>

448
1818
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,890
<i> That bastard.</i>

449
1822
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,480
You were hiding here?

450
1826
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,160
I looked for you for a long time.

451
1830
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,670
This rat-like bastard.

452
1834
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,100
Let's have a talk.

453
1838
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,430
Where are you running away?

454
1842
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:06,540
With that innocent face. It's not even two-timing, but three-timing?

455
1846
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,300
I guess medical students have a lot of free time.

456
1850
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,900
You were meeting three girls at once.

457
1854
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,110
You slyly smile in front of people.

458
1858
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,890
And then you play around with this girl and that girl behind their backs?

459
1862
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,060
No, it's a misunderstanding.

460
1866
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,540
Misunderstanding? The three victims are here, but it's a misunderstanding?

461
1870
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,070
What is this?

462
1874
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,730
No, no.

463
1878
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,110
This isn't true. Okay?

464
1882
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,070
Why is he living like that?

465
1886
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,160
It's a misunderstanding.

466
1890
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,400
This really isn't true!

467
1894
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,430
It seems true.

468
1898
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,940
Ye Rim.

469
1902
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,390
What kind of guy...

470
1906
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,580
<i> Ah. Nice timing.</i>

471
1910
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,390
<i>Mop up Operation Rat Bastard Park Hyeon Seok</i>

472
1914
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,930
<i>Rat Bastard Park Hyeon Seok/First Victim Kim Ye Rim</i>

473
1918
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,680
<i>Victim2 YeongHwa Gwan/ Victim 3 Coffeeshop</i>

474
1922
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,620
<i>Ratcatcher Ma Jin Joo /Medical Night</i>

475
1926
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,860
The scene is there where he is caught and buried in a trap he can't escape from.

476
1930
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,450
Wow, this is detailed.

477
1934
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,510
This operation was designed from just a drama, right?

478
1938
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,960
Then, don't put Korean drama down.  Aren't they better than detective agencies?

479
1942
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,970
Agreed.

480
1946
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,660
This is a misunderstanding.

481
1950
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,150
You have another girl? Four-timing?

482
1954
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,330
The more we peel, the more layers there are. Are you an onion?

483
1958
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,290
No, no, this really isn't true.

484
1962
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,420
Don't listen to them. I was just playing with them.

485
1966
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,600
You're my only one.

486
1970
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,330
Bastard.

487
1974
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,780
Ye Rim.

488
1978
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,810
What are you?

489
1982
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,460
Me?

490
1986
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,340
Is this all because of you two? What are you guys?

491
1990
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,730
I'm Ye Rim's boyfriend.

492
1994
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,900
Honey. Is this the guy you were playing around with?

493
1998
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,300
What?

494
2002
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,330
He's not much.

495
2006
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,500

498

00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,510
I think you're misunderstanding something. Don't get involved with these kinds of people.

499
2025
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,170
These kinds of people are with you for your money, you idiot.

500
2029
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,840
Because you're rich!

501
2033
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,230
Why would people like him date you?

502
2037
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,420
That's you.

503
2041
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,870
The level of talking is really declining.

504
2045
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:39,000
What did you say?

505
2049
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,020
Are you not going to let go?

506
2053
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,740
Where are you putting those hands?

511
2073
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,890
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

512
2077
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,080
That guy isn't worth crying over.

513
2081
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,200
Just leave her.

514
2085
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,400
Yeah, just cry a lot today and forget about him.

515
2089
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,620
If today hadn't happened, you would've married him and cried forever.

516
2093
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,630
How do I know? I saw it all.

517
2097
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:28,180
Through life I've noticed that this world is large and there are many boys.

518
2101
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:35,320
Women should meet a good guy for life.Not a successful guy but a good one.

519
2105
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,400
Even though there are boys like me who aren't any of those.

520
2109
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,760
Yeah, just cry now and brush it all off.

521
2113
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,440
Even though you feel like dying now,

522
2117
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,230
you have more days to live than the amount of days you've lived so far.

523
2121
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,220
What are you guys?

524
2125
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,360
I'm older than you guys!

525
2129
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,760
That's true.

526
2133
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,370
- That's right. 
 - Here.

527
2138
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,700
You should rest well when you get home.

528
2142
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,910
Don't cry.

529
2146
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,400
Oh, and...

530
2150
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,160
I knew he was meeting other girls.

531
2154
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,730
I didn't know there would be that many, but.

532
2158
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:40,680
I was scared to break up with him. So, I just cried every day.

533
2162
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,060
I feel better now that it ended up this way.

534
2166
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,600
Thank you for hitting him for me.

535
2170
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,260
You're coming now, Student? I heard you were moving out.

536
2174
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,770
Pardon? No, I'm not moving out.

537
2178
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,460
That can't be. The female student who rented this place called

538
2182
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,620
and asked for her security deposit back since she was moving out. Didn't you know?

539
2186
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,200
I'll take care of the contract by this week.

540
2190
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,500
Move out, okay? I'm going.

541
2194
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Excuse me. Ahjumma!

542
2198
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,020
She's playing with me?

543
2202
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,050
I wanted to

544
2206
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,030
Aigoo, my stomach.

545
2210
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:08,630
You, really, that's like attempted murder!

546
2214
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,630
Where did you learn how to kick that place?

547
2218
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,140
From Bo Reum.

548
2222
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:20,000
Yoon Boo Ruem Aerobics? You went there to learn that? So you can beat me?

549
2226
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,600
I didn't learn it to beat <i>you</i> up.

550
2230
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,190
Yoon Bo Reum only teaches people how to hit their husband.

551
2234
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,490
Like these kicks.

552
2238
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,360
You girls are really scary.

553
2242
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,620
I made use of it like this. I should give her an award.

554
2246
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,200
You don't think he's dead, do you?

555
2250
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,360
Oh, he didn't die, but he must've met his ancestors briefly for sure.

556
2254
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,560
That's attempted murder. You Ahjumma with no fear.

557
2258
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,100
You're calling me an Ahjumma again. I should just--

558
2262
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,870
What happened here?

559
2266
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,770
When Director Park pushed me earlier, I think I got a scratch.

560
2270
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,440
This bastard.. I ought to just--

561
2274
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,010
Why would you do such a dangerous--

562
2278
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,760
I told you he isn't an ordinary guy.

563
2282
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,010
So why are you interfering and following me there and what are you doing now?

564
2286
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,330
Why are you saying that over this? You're not even a kid.

565
2290
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,100
Really....

566
2294
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,310
Why are you upset when I am the one who's hurt.

567
2298
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,490
I am not upset.

568
2302
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,840
Do you act like this to Min Seo Young?

569
2306
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,460
Just to me, right?

570
2310
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,360
Let me see.

About what?

576
2334
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,340
Director Park.

578
2342
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:12,050
I heard he even forces you to manage his affairs.  You shouldn't let him bully you.

579
2346
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:18,070
Are you an idiot. Why would you endure that, you're not that amazing.

You know what I like?

585
2370
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,550
Someone asked me. Suddenly I had no answer and I couldn't think of anything.

586
2374
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,460
- Is there nothing that I like? 
 - Chicken soup.

587
2379
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,720
Chicken soup. Ah, right.

588
2383
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,900
I like chicken soup the most, that's right.

589
2387
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,990
Tangerines. UFC. Collecting DVDs.

590
2391
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:04,130
DVD, right. I was a movie mania.

591
2395
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:09,400
Knowing that why did you throw all my DVDs after we got married?

592
2399
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,560
What about you?

593
2403
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:16,540
Did you sell all my jewels after our honeymoon because you thought I hated them?

594
2407
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:22,430
That's because of our financial situation. We were stuck.

596

614
2489
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,290
That wench.

615
2493
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,640
What about you?

616
2497
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,510
There were about... One,

617
2501
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,300
Four people? Four people including you?

618
2505
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,060
Including me... five people.

619
2509
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,960
Five?!

620
2513
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,320
There could be more.

621
2517
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,500
What!? Wow, is that her talent?

622
2521
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,380
And... She's the one that's easy. How am I easy?

623
2525
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,890
You know that too. It's my first time dating!

624
2529
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:01,060
But what about me... what is so easy?

625
2533
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,740
W-Wait.

626
2537
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,180
Did you hear us talking that time?

627
2541
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,400
Yeah, I heard it all. I heard it all. She dated me because I'm easy.

628
2545
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,350
What she  meant was...

629
2549
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:20,310
Don't talk about Yoon Bo Reum! Don't tell me I'm easy! Just don't talk at all...

630
2553
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,750
Why are you whining at me?

631
2557
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:28,230
I won't, I won't. Whatever, I don't know. I won't know forever. I won't know until I die.

632
2561
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,360
If you like her, then that's what matters.

633
2565
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,930
The remaining four people? Just toss them all out.

634
2569
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:43,210
"Yoon Bo Reum is my girl." Get in there and steal her.

635
2573
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,440
Just like that.

636
2577
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,320
What is that?

637
2581
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,370
Is that one of the four people?

638
2585
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,760
If you had something to tell me, you could've called. How could you come find me all the way here?

639
2589
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,740
That's what I'm saying. Why are you avoiding me?

640
2593
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,560
We agreed to go on a trip together.

641
2597
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,160
Perhaps, do you.. have a man?

642
2601
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,570
No! Aish, really.

643
2605
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:17,630
Where would I have a man?

644
2609
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,100
Hey, why? You're gonna leave? Aren't you gonna watch some more?

645
2613
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,870
It's interesting.

646
2617
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,220
Ah.

647
2621
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,620
- Don't do that.
- What's the matter?

648
2626
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,300
Won't you take back that dirty hand?!

649
2630
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,130
Ahn Jae Woo!

650
2634
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:52,770
Hey, you bonehead. Can't you grasp the situation? Look at your opponent.

651
2638
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,220
What is this image?

652
2642
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,380
What is this? I asked, what is this?

653
2646
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,830
Don't do it.

654
2650
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:05,760
Hey, Ahn Jae Woo. Leave. Hurry up.

655
2654
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,740
What, you rascal? What?

656
2658
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,790
I'm... I'm her...

657
2662
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,590
I'm her boyfriend, why?!

658
2666
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:30,980
- What?
- Who? Is it you?

659
2671
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,090
It's pretty late. Are you really going to go alone?

660
2675
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:52,050
Well, my thoughts are complicated anyway, so I'll think while walking.

661
2679
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,870
Who would take an ahjumma away?

662
2683
00:49:54,870 --> 00:50:02,250
Well, you're right. Your face makes you look like you're 20, but once they grab you, they'll be too scared to take you away.

663
2687
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,480
Bye.

664
2691
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,790
Wait, Jin Joo.

665
2695
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:23,560
I saw the May Queen contest. It was nice.

666
2699
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:32,580
I remember that I used to like it when you sang. I forgot.

667
2703
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:38,970
What is this? this unexpected talk...

668
2707
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:48,000
If I talk nicely, can't you just take it nicely.

669
2711
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,310
You're changing the subject.

670
2715
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,150
I spoke in vain.

671
2719
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,080
I wonder if she got back okay.

672
2723
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:04,280
What the heck? Who is she calling at this time?

673
2727
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,650
Answer your phone, you punk.

674
2731
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,400
Yes, hello?

675
2735
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,600
Where are you?

676
2739
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,670
You can't see anything in front of you, can you?

677
2743
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:36,380
I can't see either.

678
2747
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,820
What are you doing right now? Leave before I scream.

679
2751
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,410
Scream. Scream to your heart's content.

680
2755
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,170
I said, scream!

681
2759
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,150
It's all ruined anyway. You.

682
2763
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:58,830
Do you know how much I had to suffer by staying by that ugly Kim Ye Rim's side?

683
2767
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:04,800
I didn't know that, but I do know that you're a pitiful excuse for a human being.

684
2771
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,930
Does your mother know that you do these things?

685
2775
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,390
Are you a teacher? Have you lost your mind?

686
2779
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:23,740
I told you. I can beat up women.

687
2783
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,900
I'll hit you, and then go to prison.

688
2787
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,370
I said I'll go to prison!

2795
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:45,880
Kim Ye Rim knew that Director Park was cheating. What a twist.

691
2799
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:51,930
How much do you think she liked him that she kept that all in and even married him?

692
2803
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:56,000
He lost that kind of girl. Aiyoo, what a pitiful bastard.

693
2807
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,120
Were we seeing too much from one view?

694
2811
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,930
A love that hurts too much isn't love.

695
2815
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:07,650
That isn't love, it's violence.

696
2819
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:11,160
It's the strongest, and the worst kind of violence.

697
2823
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:17,690
Even through an affair blossoms, later it becomes dull and tiresome.

698
2827
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:19,400
How does that make sense?

699
2831
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,810
If that bastard cheats on her with a hundred people,

700
2835
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:25,590
then that woman will remember the names of every one of those people.

701
2839
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:29,720
Like the  blade of a knife, it should not become dull.

702
2843
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:37,770
The belief which I have lived with until now, affection, my values would hit rock bottom.

703
2847
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,310
Bad bastard.

Why?
