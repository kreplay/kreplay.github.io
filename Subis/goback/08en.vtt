3
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.200
Oh, Madam. Why are you here without any prior notice?

4
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.750
Where is Nurse Kim?

5
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.470
Oh, Honey. Why did you come so suddenly?

6
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.780
You've arrived, Madam?

7
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.210
You can leave. Ah, please bring out some hortensia tea that my wife likes so much.

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.090
Yes.

9
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.670
Aiyoo, you came well, Honey.

10
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.760
I was so tired, but we must've communicated telepathically.

11
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.710
Oh! Ah, really?

12
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.100
Yeah. I was thinking that if I could see your face, then I could live.

13
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.930
How did you come at such a perfect time?

14
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.770
Ah, I came well.

15
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.410
I missed you, Honey.

16
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.900
You should stay a while before you leave.

17
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.660
- No, it's okay. Go in now.
- Okay, bye.

<i>I missed you, Honey.</i>

24
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.440
<i>She was not tricked because she couldn't differentiate between the truth and the lies. </i>

25
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.520
<i>Instead, it might be because she was pretending not to know so she could love him.</i>

We'll see.

Me?

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.050
I'm... her...

45
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.640
Friend. Yeah, friend.

46
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.700
What are you?

47
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.080
What nonsense.

48
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.850
Move. I have to change my clothes.

49
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.200
What? You have to change your clothes? Here? Together?

50
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.040
Are you crazy? What are you thinking about?

51
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.740
Hurry and leave. You're driving me mad.

52
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.240
She's gone properly crazy. Truly insane.

53
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.120
Does she really think she's 20 or what?

54
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.060
Hey.

55
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.110
"Hey"?

56
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.980
Did you just say "hey" to me?

57
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.300
Ma Jin Joo. You just heard him, right?

58
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.280
You young one who hasn't even come in contact with a dog tag yet...

59
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.300
He said "hey". "Hey".

60
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.280
You've really softened up over the years Choi Ban Do.

61
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.810
Aren't you a freshman? Have you taken the CSAT, oh say, five times?

62
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.540
That's not it.

63
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.930
You know even in poop, I've pooped at least 10 million times more than you have.

64
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.220
You're so dirty.

65
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.260
Don't pay attention to him. Here. Take it.

66
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.220
You should put it back nicely in your car so that your younger sister doesn't find out.

67
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.970
The tag wasn't even cut off.

68
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.290
Nonsense. Younger sister?

69
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.370
Hey. What kind of brother carries his younger sister's clothes in his car?

70
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.630
I see right through you. You bought it for a girl.

71
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.740
You're right.

72
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.080
I bought it for you.

73
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.010
What? Me?

74
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.570
Wear it well. I'm leaving.

75
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.020
What is that expression? Is he laughing at me?

76
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.310
That little punk...

77
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.940
- Hey.
- What?

78
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.310
You're much littler. Haven't you ever seen a mirror?

79
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:19.540
Right. Life is so good since you're trying to live a new life with a tall and sexy guy, right?

80
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.500
Wait--

81
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.760
Why are you crying even when you're eating something expensive?

82
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.600
Hm? I bought the most expensive one.

83
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.720
Don't cry now.

84
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.640
Choi Ban Do, this bastard-like bastard.

85
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:21.250
Choi Ban Do. You bad bastard. I ought to just! Just!

86
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:26.620
She truly has a drunk personality. It's one where she talks about others behind their back.

87
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.660
Seol. You should stop drinking.

88
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:36.010
Hey. I can't not drink this alcohol.

89
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:42.060
Why? Because our Jin Joo is so pitiful.

90
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.860
You have some sense.

91
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.540
This?

92
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.180
You know a bit. It's from Italy.

93
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.460
There's not a lot of this model in Korea.

94
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.370
But, girls usually don't know this.

95
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:06.040
I'm not usual. I probably have more guy things than you.

96
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.350
As expected, Bo Reum has a lot of men.

97
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.560
You're pretty well off, right?

98
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.250
Oh you can tell? I try to hide my upbringing, but you can tell?

99
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.660
Aigoo, I can't compliment you at all.

100
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:27.700
What? Where'd it go? Where'd my appetizers go?

101
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.230
The appetizers are in your stomach.

102
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.630
I did? Really?

103
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.900
Did An Jae Woo ditch or what? Why isn't he here?

104
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.560
♬ <i> My love is leaving me. </i> ♬ (Kim Gun Mo - <i> Love is Gone)</i>

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:58.130
<i> Because he's easy.</i>

♬ <i> Was I just expecting too much? ♬</i>

109
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.680
Are you crying because of love?

110
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.560
The solution for you who has been crying and laughing because of love.

111
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.130
She did not fall for you. Again, today,

112
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.470
Here with us today to cleanly solve your problems, Bro's Leader,

113
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.610
Lee Sang Min. Please say hello.

114
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.490
Hello, Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Sang Min.

115
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.770
It's the end of May, but you've decided to wear fur?

116
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.370
Yes, since I've been trying to emulate the East Coast style.

117
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.980
- What? Where? 
 -The East Coast. 
 - Ah I see.

118
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.040
You look hot. It's a headache whether you're in or out of love.

119
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.120
I wonder who today's caller is. Let me connect. Hello?

120
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.210
<i>Hello, I'm Tinkerbell from Seoul.</i>

121
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.480
Oh, you're a fairy, Tinkerbell.

122
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.200
So shall we have a listen to what your concern is?

123
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:51.700
<i>There's someone that I'm meeting. That person really likes physical intimacy.</i>

124
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.980
Every time we meet we kiss,

125
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.480
<i>touch, and kiss again.</i>

126
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.740
I feel like oh maybe it's for that intimacy that we're meeting.

127
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.630
But you know a kiss is something that's shared because you like each other.

128
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:12.920
But does the person touch a particular place? That's important.

129
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.130
Mostly my buttocks.

130
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:21.890
Your behind? That's quite deep. So your bottom is being touched, I see.

131
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:26.590
How about talking it about it with your significant other? I'm sure that's not the reason why...

132
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:32.300
I did ask! That person's going out with me because I'm easy.

133
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.380
How can that person say that outright?

134
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.980
It wasn't said to me, directly per se.

135
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.540
So if we are to summarize, your significant other, Tinkerbell

136
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.840
touches you everyday on your behind.

137
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.900
And the reason that you guys are together is because you're easy. Is that correct?

138
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.280
<i>Yes.</i>

139
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.340
This is a bit much. I would almost hope you broke up immediately.

140
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.670
Wait. No, this isn't it.

141
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.550
It's a dangerous world right now. That boy's a jerk.

142
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.060
He said that so directly. The times have changed.

143
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.360
Even if he might seem charming now, this might end up being a huge problem in the future.

144
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.800
<i>Does that person also like to drink?</i>

145
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.380
How did you know?

146
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.610
That's the way it is. I like girls, no women.

147
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.330
They like everyone. They're like that.

148
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.230
Right. He's probably meeting a lot of girls.

149
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.750
<i>Tinker Bell, you might also be one of them.</i>

150
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.830
No way.

151
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.520
I'm an expert in that field, so just trust me. Break up with him.

152
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.620
Miss Tinker Bell, good luck!

153
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.210
Miss? I'm a mister.

154
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.140
Hello?

155
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.310
But, how could he say that outright to his girlfriend?

156
00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:00.250
Hyung, I'm worried about you. As it is, you're old and live alone.

157
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.300
You have to marry someone quickly to have a kid. It's not like you're Superman.

158
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.530
I assure you, I will marry before you do.

159
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.740
- You? 
 - Of course. 
 - Want to bet?

160
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.380
Fine, deal. But I won't count it if you get married and then divorce.

161
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.780
- I think you have to count that.
- Why?

162
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.340
Once someone marries, you don't know what'll happen in the future. The beginning is the most important.

163
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.370
- The end result isn't important.
- You're talking like someone who has had a lot of experience. Fine, fine.

164
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:27.810
Anyway, Miss Tinker Bell can't meet a boy like that.

165
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.400
<i>[Oppa ♥]</i>

166
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.410
Oh, hi.

167
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.300
Next week?

168
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.320
Okay, let's meet up.

169
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:51.350
<i> Hi, I'm Park Hyeon Seok, the medical major you saw at the nightclub.</i>

170
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.410
<i> Are you free today?</i>

171
00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.250
<i> Let's meet again.</i>

172
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.120
<i> It seems like you're just happy and excited because a boy gave you his number.</i>

173
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.870
<i> Director Park is just playing with a girl like you.</i>

174
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.280
<i>I called dibs on her. Don't get involved.</i>

175
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.680
<i> I'll hand her over when I get bored with her. Just wait.</i>

176
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.300
Other people ponder whether or not they should go to that concours once in a year.

177
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.040
This is already my third time this year, Mom.

178
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.860
I can also have a slump.

179
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.860
How can I always think about ballet and not rest?

180
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.330
I'm exhausted!

181
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.370
It's not easy to live as a kid or as an adult.

182
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.640
Right?

183
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.540
Did you hear me?

184
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.310
Just leave your house.

185
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.880
"I'm going to to leave with the wind." And you just run away from home. How's that?

186
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.620
What? Am I a high schooler? I'm not a kid, why would I run away from home?

187
00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.860
You are a kid. You still have to grow a lot.

188
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.890
Now you're smiling. I just said it for you to smile, that's all.

189
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.440
Yeah, thanks to you, I'm smiling.

190
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.760
Hold on.

191
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.610
Hello?

192
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.630
Hey, where are you?

193
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.010
Ma Jin Joo?

194
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:34.270
Where are you? Hey, who really is this Park Hyeon Seok boy?

195
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.270
Did he do something to you?

196
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.620
Where are you? Stay where you are. I'll be right there.

197
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.540
Something urgent came up. I'll be going now.

198
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.040
What? Oh. Okay.

199
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.620
Where are you?

200
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.470
You're really not going?

201
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.740
- What? 
 - Medical Student's Night.

202
00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:01.620
You're supposed to introduce your girlfriend there. I've noticed you don't go every year.

203
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.900
I have to study. Instead of showing our relationship to others,

204
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:10.340
I should graduate quickly. I want to be more fitting for your household.

205
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.050
<i> How could I take you there? Have you not seen yourself in the mirror?</i>

206
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.620
Don't be cautious of my household.

207
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.370
It only matters if I like you or not. Would my dad need a doctor as his son-in-law?

208
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.580
<i> I need your dad.</i>

209
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.330
I think I'll have to ask my dad to buy another car.

210
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.810
It's hard to go from place to place while having to study. It'll be tiring.

211
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.520
Don't do that.

212
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.930
I'm already selfish for accepting that free room from you, if you continue to do this, I can't date you.

213
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.930
Do you think I'm dating you because I want a car?

214
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.500
<i>How are you try to compensate me with a car.</i>

215
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.410
You're too nice...

216
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.730
That trash-like bastard.

217
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.830
So, he got a hospital after seducing a rich woman,

218
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.830
and then he played around and cheated?

219
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.650
Played around?

220
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:14.080
- Hey, you should be careful of what you say with that face.
- Did I say something wrong?

221
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.550
Anyway, that future wife is his girlfriend now. Then what about his advances towards me?

222
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.580
<i> If I get bored with her, I'll give her to you. Just wait.</i>

223
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.080
- Am I second?
- Then would you be the first?

224
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.990
He approached you just so he could play with you one time.

225
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.360
He has so many more of those kinds of girls. That's why I told you not to get involved with him.

226
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.940
But how do you know this in so much detail? You only had a work relationship with him.

227
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.030
Well ... just ...

228
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.940
Perhaps... were you his errand boy?

229
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.960
Err-- Errand boy? Your words a bit harsh. What are you talking about?

230
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:52.530
Work relationships are usually like that. Take care of the client's personal matters so that he will--

231
00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.820
You really did all sorts of things.

232
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.840
All sorts of them.

233
00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.880
<i> - Did you eat? 
 - No.</i>

234
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.850
<i> - You went this long without eating? 
 - I was busy.</i>

235
00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:26.040
<i> Yes, Director. Three boxes by next morning?</i>

236
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.980
<i> Yes, sir. Have a good night!</i>

237
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.010
What?

238
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.640
How much did I drink last night?

239
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.410
That bastard.

240
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:56.130
Hey. Hey. You left those two scary girls

241
00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:01.450
alone with me! You ran away? Get up.

242
00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.190
Wake up!

243
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.220
Turn around. Oh, geez!

244
00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.800
A frozen corpse, a deep sea fish, what are you?

245
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.350
<i> Appetizers.</i>

246
00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.660
<i> I have to cut it up to eat it.</i>

247
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.390
<i>You can't have beef jerky in his house, really.</i>

248
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.370
<i> Cheon Seol!!</i>

249
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:08.670
What is this? Gloves? Oh, no! Who did this?

250
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:14.720
Who? Do you not remember? Wow, she's saying she doesn't remember!

251
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.760
But where else can I resolve this unfairness?

252
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.080
Oh no. Yesterday.

253
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.520
Yeah, that's right. After you were drunk yesterday, you...

254
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.980
Look, Cheon Seol.

255
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.550
I'm not saying I'm going to do anything to you. But, when you get drunk...

256
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:40.600
Yeah, you have bad drinking habits too. You can fix those.

257
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.600
Good luck.

258
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.240
Hey, where are you going?

259
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.230
This is your drinking habit!

260
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.740
She knows. She knows and she's acting like that.

261
00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.260
I'm the victim, I'm the victim!

262
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.760
I'm crazy!

263
00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.870
That must've been really expensive.

264
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:22.780
Sorry, Dok Jae. I'll pay you back for sure in the future.

265
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.180
You're doing what? Revenge?

266
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.100
What, for me?

267
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.420
Never mind, I already got revenge on him.

268
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:38.100
I've already gotten a bit of revenge for your sake, too.

269
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.130
What?

270
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.160
<i> Oh, I'm sorry. Please have some of this.</i>

271
00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.830
<i> Oh, I thought you were my friend.</i>

272
00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:01.980
That is so like you. Petty revenge. You should punish him properly!

273
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.830
Only you don't have to get involved. Why would I go to such extents?

274
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:09.940
Also, even a minute and second of youth are so precious. Do you really have the time to waste all of it on him?

275
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.100
Don't you have feelings? You were so mistreated, don't you feel wronged?

276
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:19.190
Why are you like this suddenly? Are you like this because you're upset about how that guy mistreated me?

277
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.630
Right? That's why you want revenge, right?

278
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.880
Do you think that's the only reason?

279
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.720
He put a leash on a girl and led her on.

280
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.080
He hurt a girl's heart by cheating on her.

281
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.340
And, he saw me as a second. He deserves karma.

282
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.200
Okay. What do you want to do?

283
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.610
You looked down on me because I kept watching those melodrama like dramas, right?

284
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:45.070
I will show what a real melodrama plot is like.

285
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.590
<i> Yes, I'll see you in the afternoon.</i>

286
00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:00.030
If you want to bite the tail of a rat-like bastard, you have to find a way into the rat's hole first.

287
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.560
- But, there's something you have to do before that. 
 - Let's just not get involved, okay?

288

What do you want me to do?

290
00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.600
You can't go into a rat's hole with nothing. You have to bring what the rat likes.

291
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.800
What he likes? He likes money.

292
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.420
Oh...

293
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.950
What's with you? I'm so lazy.

294
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.840
- Have you heard? 
 - Heard what?

295
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.190
- The granddaughter of Samsung Group attends our school. 
 - Samsung Group?

296
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.250
Hey, don't lie. Why would that rich person come to our school?

297
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:44.740
I'm telling the truth. She must be attending this school secretly to help out the company.

298
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.270
Who is it? Is it someone you know?

299
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.330
This is confirmed information from the student council president.

300
00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:54.010
Ma Jin Joo from the history department.

301
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.200

Sorry, I came late. You should've ordered something.

306
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.850
No, it's fine.

307
00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.280
Your order?

308
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:26.910
- I'll have a cold, refreshing lemonade? 
 - I'll have one cup of espresso.

309
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.530
That should be really bitter.

310
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.470
I've gone out to other countries a lot. So, I've had espresso a lot.

311
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.500
Oh, I see. You travel to other countries a lot.

312
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.150
I should probably do that when I graduate. I'll go out and visit other countries.

313

<i> You bastard, you'll be leaving your house to cheat on your wife.</i>

314
00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.920
I wanted to contact you sooner but pre-med has a lot of homework.

315
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.940
Oh, if you're a medical student, there's something called a Medical Student's Night, right?

316
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.860
Yeah. How did you know?

317
00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.720
My friend's boyfriend is a medical student. She was bragging about how she was going there.

318
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.070
Do you want to go together?

319
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.900
Really?

320
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:29.260
Ah, no. You have a girlfriend. How could I go?

321
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:34.550
I heard from other people. That Kim Ye Rim is your girlfriend.

322
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.750
<i> Darn, where did she hear this from?</i>

323
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:44.240
No, she's not my girlfriend. We dated briefly in the past, but she kept following me around, so.

324
00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:48.080
Well, you never know.

325
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.430
Anyway, since there's someone you have unfinished business with, I don't think I should go.

326
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:57.350
No, it'll be finished soon. Actually, it's already finished.

327
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.450
Don't worry about it.

328
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:07.300
Oh, Ma Jin Joo. You're going to get rid of his wife with your own hands I see.

329
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.130
I will cut off his tail.

330
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.260
What did you say right now?

331
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.350
<i> I,</i>

332
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:18.550
<i> I really like you.</i>

333
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.520
<i>As it is he is sewage. He's done so much hard work.</i>

334
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.410
Will that smart kid abandon her?

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.290
Naturally if there is anything fishy, it's going to sting more.

336
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:31.730
Whatever the gift, we should be on the offensive. We aim for the head, not the tail.

337
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.590
So, you're really going to Medical Student's Night with him?

338
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.900
As for any affairs that happen in the world, what must you catch?

339
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.820
I know this. The scene of the crime.

340
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.330
- Hey, you. 
 - Yes?

341
00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:56.050
- Have you not seen Ahn Jae Woo? 
 - He didn't come today.

342
00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.360
What is this? He hasn't even been answering my calls.

343
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.800
Did you drop something? Money? Do you want me to look for it with you?

344
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.760
No.

345
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.510
- Let's go. 
 - Where?

346
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:39.920
- Let's drink. 
 - No, but I don't really feel like drinking.

347
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.300
<i> Just ask her directly. </i>

348
00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.910
Are you reciting a Buddhist chant? What is it? You're bumping your nose on the beer.

349
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:52.730
You have something worrying you, right? Tell me, this noona will listen.

350
00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.190
Hey....

351
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.210
Hold on, I have to use the restroom.

352
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.950
Wait a little bit.

353
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.460
Yeah. Just let her know directly.

354
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.800
I won't know the truth until I hear it directly from her.

355

365
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:14.550
Sorry.

366
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.670
What's wrong? Are you crying?

367
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.410
Hey, which number boyfriend am I?

368
00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.520

Also, am I a math problem? Why am I easy?

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:47.980
I am really really complicated!!

He wanted me to take you to Medical Student's Night.

Really? He said he wasn't going, but.

Wow, look at this place.

401
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.940
Wow, what a big event.

402

Wait, hold up. You don't have anything like a weak heart, right?

412
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.550
No, no. Let's go.

- Do you want to? 
 - What?

416
00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:25.900
<i>Of course I do, we agreed to go.</i>

417
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:30.750
What are you? Why are you approaching me?

418
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:35.780
I don't know what you're talking about. You contacted me first.

419
00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.940
At first, yeah.

420
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.430
<i> Do you know the granddaughter of Samsung Group, by any chance?</i>

421
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.910
<i> They don't have a granddaughter. Only grandsons.</i>

422
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.720
<i> They came from the same preschool as me, so I know very well.</i>

423
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.300
<i> - Oh, really? 
 - Yeah.</i>

424
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.990
<i>But why? Is it someone you know?</i>

425
00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:02.070
<i> No, I was just wondering.</i>

426
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.200
<i>It seems someone's playing a trick on me.</i>

427
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.610
<i>Who? Who's doing that to you?</i>

428
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.830
Samsung Group doesn't have a granddaughter. Are you a boy?

429
00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:17.980
Do I have to check?

430
00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:22.180
Samsung Group? Who said I'm the granddaughter?

431
00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.040
Your friend.

432
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.370
I was pushed into the pool a while ago because of him.

433
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:36.940
I thought about it, and I realized that I'd talked about you before.

434
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.340
What are you two?

435
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.360
I think you were misinformed. It's not me. Oh, my!

436
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.120
What are you two?

437
00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.410
How did you know I'm dating Kim Ye Rim?

438
00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:57.860
Even if you look like this, I can hit women.

439
00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.940
- What are you! 
 - Park Hyeon Seok!

440
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.800
You.

441
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.010

Gather all of Park Hyeon Seok's seconds?

443
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.030
Yeah. You said he has a lot of girls.

444
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:21.630
If we're going to catch him in the act, we shouldn't leave any holes where he can escape through.

445
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:32.090
<i> I don't want to leave you.</i>

446
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:33.880
<i> You have to leave?</i>

447
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.230
<i> Okay. Call me again.</i>

448
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.890
<i> That bastard.</i>

449
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.480
You were hiding here?

450
00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.160
I looked for you for a long time.

451
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.670
This rat-like bastard.

452
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.100
Let's have a talk.

453
00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.430
Where are you running away?

454
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:06.540
With that innocent face. It's not even two-timing, but three-timing?

455
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.300
I guess medical students have a lot of free time.

456
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.900
You were meeting three girls at once.

457
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.110
You slyly smile in front of people.

458
00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:17.890
And then you play around with this girl and that girl behind their backs?

459
00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.060
No, it's a misunderstanding.

460
00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.540
Misunderstanding? The three victims are here, but it's a misunderstanding?

461
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.070
What is this?

462
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.730
No, no.

463
00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.110
This isn't true. Okay?

464
00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.070
Why is he living like that?

465
00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.160
It's a misunderstanding.

466
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.400
This really isn't true!

467
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.430
It seems true.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.390

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.450
Wow, this is detailed.

477
00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.510
This operation was designed from just a drama, right?

478
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:11.960
Then, don't put Korean drama down. Aren't they better than detective agencies?

479

Agreed.

No, no, this really isn't true.

484
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:31.420

511
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.890
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

512
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.080
That guy isn't worth crying over.

513
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.200
Just leave her.

514
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.400
Yeah, just cry a lot today and forget about him.

515
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.620
If today hadn't happened, you would've married him and cried forever.

516
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.630
How do I know? I saw it all.

517
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:28.180
Through life I've noticed that this world is large and there are many boys.

518
00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:35.320
Women should meet a good guy for life.Not a successful guy but a good one.

519
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.400
Even though there are boys like me who aren't any of those.

520
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.760
Yeah, just cry now and brush it all off.

521
00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.440
Even though you feel like dying now,

522
00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.230
you have more days to live than the amount of days you've lived so far.

523
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.220
What are you guys?

524
00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.360
I'm older than you guys!

525
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.760
That's true.

526
00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:13.370
- That's right. 
 - Here.

527
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.700
You should rest well when you get home.

528
00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.910
Don't cry.

529
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.400
Oh, and...

530
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:30.160
I knew he was meeting other girls.

531
00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.730
I didn't know there would be that many, but.

532
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:40.680
I was scared to break up with him. So, I just cried every day.

533
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.060
I feel better now that it ended up this way.

534
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:55.600
Thank you for hitting him for me.

535
00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:20.260
You're coming now, Student? I heard you were moving out.

536
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.770
Pardon? No, I'm not moving out.

537
00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:27.460
That can't be. The female student who rented this place called

538
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.620
and asked for her security deposit back since she was moving out. Didn't you know?

539
00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.200
I'll take care of the contract by this week.

540
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.500
Move out, okay? I'm going.

541
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.500
Excuse me. Ahjumma!

542
00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:56.020
She's playing with me?

543
00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.050
I wanted to

544
00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.030
Aigoo, my stomach.

545
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:08.630
You, really, that's like attempted murder!

546
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:11.630
Where did you learn how to kick that place?

547
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.140
From Bo Reum.

548
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:20.000
Yoon Boo Ruem Aerobics? You went there to learn that? So you can beat me?

549
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.600
I didn't learn it to beat <i>you</i> up.

550
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.190
Yoon Bo Reum only teaches people how to hit their husband.

551
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:30.490
Like these kicks.

552
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:33.360
You girls are really scary.

553
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:38.620
I made use of it like this. I should give her an award.

554
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:42.200
You don't think he's dead, do you?

555
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:47.360
Oh, he didn't die, but he must've met his ancestors briefly for sure.

556
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:51.560
That's attempted murder. You Ahjumma with no fear.

557
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.100
You're calling me an Ahjumma again. I should just--

558
00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.870
What happened here?

559
00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.770
When Director Park pushed me earlier, I think I got a scratch.

560
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.440
This bastard.. I ought to just--

561
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.010
Why would you do such a dangerous--

562
00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.760
I told you he isn't an ordinary guy.

563
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.010
So why are you interfering and following me there and what are you doing now?

564
00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.330
Why are you saying that over this? You're not even a kid.

565
00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:25.100
Really....

566
00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:29.310
Why are you upset when I am the one who's hurt.

567
00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.490
I am not upset.

568
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:34.840
Do you act like this to Min Seo Young?

569
00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.460
Just to me, right?

570
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.360

About what?

576
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.340
Director Park.

577
00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.890
♬ <i> Have we stayed the same? ♬</i>

578
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:12.050
I heard he even forces you to manage his affairs. You shouldn't let him bully you.

579
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:18.070

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:44.550
Someone asked me. Suddenly I had no answer and I couldn't think of anything.

586
00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:49.460
- Is there nothing that I like? 
 - Chicken soup.

587
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.720
Chicken soup. Ah, right.

588
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.900
I like chicken soup the most, that's right.

589
00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:58.990
Tangerines. UFC. Collecting DVDs.

590
00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:04.130
DVD, right. I was a movie mania.

591
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:09.400
Knowing that why did you throw all my DVDs after we got married?

592
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.560
What about you?

593
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:16.540
Did you sell all my jewels after our honeymoon because you thought I hated them?

594
00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:22.430
That's because of our financial situation. We were stuck.

♬ <i> That touch was wonderful. ♬</i>

596
00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:29.110
Is knowing what you like really that important?

597
00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:33.030
It's a busy life just trying to live and eat.

614
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.290
That wench.

615
00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:26.640
What about you?

616
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.510
There were about... One,

617
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.300
Four people? Four people including you?

618
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.060
Including me... five people.

619
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.960
Five?!

620
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.320
There could be more.

621
00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:49.500
What!? Wow, is that her talent?

622
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:53.380
And... She's the one that's easy. How am I easy?

623
00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:57.890
You know that too. It's my first time dating!

624
00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:01.060
But what about me... what is so easy?

625
00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.740
W-Wait.

626
00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:07.180
Did you hear us talking that time?

627
00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:12.400
Yeah, I heard it all. I heard it all. She dated me because I'm easy.

628
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.350
What she meant was...

629
00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:20.310
Don't talk about Yoon Bo Reum! Don't tell me I'm easy! Just don't talk at all...

630
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.750
Why are you whining at me?

631
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:28.230
I won't, I won't. Whatever, I don't know. I won't know forever. I won't know until I die.

632
00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:34.360
If you like her, then that's what matters.

633
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.930
The remaining four people? Just toss them all out.

634
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:43.210
"Yoon Bo Reum is my girl." Get in there and steal her.

635
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.440
Just like that.

636
00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.320
What is that?

637
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:53.370
Is that one of the four people?

638
00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.760
If you had something to tell me, you could've called. How could you come find me all the way here?

639
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.740
That's what I'm saying. Why are you avoiding me?

640
00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.560
We agreed to go on a trip together.

641
00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:12.160
Perhaps, do you.. have a man?

642
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.570
No! Aish, really.

643
00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:17.630
Where would I have a man?

644
00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.100
Hey, why? You're gonna leave? Aren't you gonna watch some more?

645
00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.870
It's interesting.

646
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.220
Ah.

647
00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.620
- Don't do that.
- What's the matter?

648
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.300
Won't you take back that dirty hand?!

649
00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.130
Ahn Jae Woo!

650
00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:52.770
Hey, you bonehead. Can't you grasp the situation? Look at your opponent.

651
00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:56.220
What is this image?

652
00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:00.380
What is this? I asked, what is this?

653
00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.830
Don't do it.

654
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:05.760
Hey, Ahn Jae Woo. Leave. Hurry up.

655
00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.740
What, you rascal? What?

656
00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:17.790
I'm... I'm her...

657
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:24.590
I'm her boyfriend, why?!

658
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:30.980
- What?
- Who? Is it you?

659
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:47.090
It's pretty late. Are you really going to go alone?

660
00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:52.050
Well, my thoughts are complicated anyway, so I'll think while walking.

661
00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:54.870
Who would take an ahjumma away?

662
00:49:54.870 --> 00:50:02.250
Well, you're right. Your face makes you look like you're 20, but once they grab you, they'll be too scared to take you away.

663
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.480
Bye.

664
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:12.790
Wait, Jin Joo.

665
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:23.560
I saw the May Queen contest. It was nice.

666
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:32.580
I remember that I used to like it when you sang. I forgot.

667
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:38.970
What is this? this unexpected talk...

668
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:48.000
If I talk nicely, can't you just take it nicely.

669
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.310
You're changing the subject.

670
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:04.150
I spoke in vain.

671
00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.080
I wonder if she got back okay.

672
00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:04.280
What the heck? Who is she calling at this time?

673
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.650
Answer your phone, you punk.

674
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.400
Yes, hello?

675
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.600
Where are you?

676
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:31.670
You can't see anything in front of you, can you?

677
00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:36.380
I can't see either.

678
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.820
What are you doing right now? Leave before I scream.

679
00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:43.410
Scream. Scream to your heart's content.

680
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.170
I said, scream!

681
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:53.150
It's all ruined anyway. You.

682
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:58.830
Do you know how much I had to suffer by staying by that ugly Kim Ye Rim's side?

683
00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:04.800
I didn't know that, but I do know that you're a pitiful excuse for a human being.

684
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.930
Does your mother know that you do these things?

685
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:15.390
Are you a teacher? Have you lost your mind?

686
00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:23.740
I told you. I can beat up women.

687
00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:26.900
I'll hit you, and then go to prison.

688
00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:29.370
I said I'll go to prison!

689
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:37.140
<i></i>

690
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:45.880
Kim Ye Rim knew that Director Park was cheating. What a twist.

691
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:51.930
How much do you think she liked him that she kept that all in and even married him?

692
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:56.000
He lost that kind of girl. Aiyoo, what a pitiful bastard.

693
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.120
Were we seeing too much from one view?

694
00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.930
A love that hurts too much isn't love.

695
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:07.650
That isn't love, it's violence.

696
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:11.160
It's the strongest, and the worst kind of violence.

697
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:17.690
Even through an affair blossoms, later it becomes dull and tiresome.

698
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:19.400
How does that make sense?

699
00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.810
If that bastard cheats on her with a hundred people,

700
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:25.590
then that woman will remember the names of every one of those people.

701
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:29.720
Like the blade of a knife, it should not become dull.

702
00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:37.770
The belief which I have lived with until now, affection, my values would hit rock bottom.

703
00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.310
Bad bastard.

704
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:47.570
Why?

705
00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:56.400
You said that for me to hear, right? I didn't cheat that time.

Do I have to report this to the police?

729
00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:41.140
She's very strange these days.

730

- Go Dok, where are you going?
- To study!

731
00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:48.760
Doesn't the fact that Cheon Seol kept it for 18 years mean that it bothered her so? This time she must be found.

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.810
You seem like an adult.

You changed too much in a span of a few weeks.

Tell me truthfully. Who is Seo Jin?
