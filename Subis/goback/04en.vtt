There's a giant thing called the heart that's present during youth.

Without rhyme or reason, embarrassingly, It's always going ba dump, ba dump!

Did I drink because I wanted to?

30
120
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,270
I had an ulterior motive!  Ugh, that heavy drinker.

31
124
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,460

32

95

Don't be a history major. You can't earn any money.

98
397
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,560

100
405
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,550
Change your major to business management and learn how to run things, or go into the school office and learn the school system.

He is too spoiled.

110
445
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,910
I should stop giving him allowance.

111

453

121
494
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,720
So, exactly how did you give birth?

122
498
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,730
Do you not know my birthday?

123

It's today. The day you gave birth to me.

139

<i>Why don't you make a sign saying  we left our kid to start over?</i>

140
570
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,800
<i>Things like this happen when people are drunk. You think I can't do it?</i>

141
574
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,590
- It is a fact after all. 
 - There you go talking about facts.

142
579
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,590
You and I are both in the same boat if people find out.

<i>You can't get yourself together.</i>

<i>That is more outrageous.  You're an ahjumma..</i>

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,790
<i>I'm going to leave you penniless.</i>

158
643
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,400
<i>I'm a student.</i>

159
647
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,070
<i>I can't even afford gum. I'm a student. A broke student.</i>

160
651
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,680
<i>I can't  give it to you. No, I won't give it.</i>

161
655
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,700
<i>Why should I hand over the money?</i>

162
659
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,760
<i>Wow, this is unbelievable.</i>

163
663
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
There is a married student?

164
667
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,190
You stingy jerk.

165
671
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,330
Why? I thought you liked gum. The price of gum!

166
675
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:02,940
Yeah, that's right. You are so cheap. I don't know what I was thinking.

167
679
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,830
My stomach hurts, so bad.

168
683
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,910
Of course, it would hurt when you drank that much. Lady!

169
687
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,160
Only people who know how to party can do that.

170
691
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,930
You should't pretend to be something you aren't.

171
695
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
What?

172
699
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,870
That scared me.

173
703
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,030
- Hey! Ma Jin Joo! 
 - What?!

174
708
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,540
Don't contact that guy you met at the club yesterday. Don't get involved with him!

175
712
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,800
It seems as if you're just happy that a guy gave you his number,

176
716
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,510
but Doctor Park... He's just playing with you! Get it?

177
720
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,270
Oh, he's a doctor?

178
724
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,390
- What? 
 - In the future? He is a doctor, who works at a hospital?

179
729
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,400
Then, he had to be a man with taste, huh.

180
733
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:04,170
Then, I should take this chance to change my future. Thanks, Choi Ban Do.

181
737
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,570
Hey. Hey!

182
741
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,650
Just how much longer are we going to stay here?

183
745
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,760
- You left with the door open? 
 - I don't know!

184
750
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,580
He left his first wife that he had a child with and went to find his first love!

185
754
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,310
And, his first love doesn't even know he was a married man!

186
758
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,060
Hey, what is this? What's with the noise?

187
762
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,830
- A great thing was revealed. 
 - A great thing?

188
767
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,790
At our school, there's a student who was married.

189
771
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,400
What? Are you serious?

190
775
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,420
Hey, at what age did this student get married and get a divorce?

191
779
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,960
That's not important. Both of them are cheating on each other.

192
783
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,090
- Cheating? 
 - Well, no, since they already had a divorce.

193
788
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,160
But, they have a kid.

194
792
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,100
A kid? Wow. Kids these days are so scary.

195
796
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,160
Hey, he said he wouldn't give the alimony so he made a big deal.

196
800
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,910
Wow, that bastard! He's trash!

197
804
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,050
He's the kind of trash that you can't recycle or throw away.

198
808
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,970
He said he's a student and he can't earn a penny.

199
812
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:30,130
The girl was yelling, "Tightwad!"

200
816
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:38,270
A tightwad? Hey. Where'd you hear that from?

201
820
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,540
From that. There was a live broadcast from the broadcasting room a while ago. Everyone here heard it.

202
824
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,160
He won't even pay alimony. What a huge fool!

203
828
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,530
- Fool? 
- He's trash!

204
833
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,870
Trash?

205
837
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,090
She should be home taking care of her child. Why is she at school seducing a younger boy?

206
841
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,170
It's the end of the world now. It's a crazy world.

207
845
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,780
<i>I feel like I might lose my mind.</i>

208
849
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,370
So, they could've married during high school and had a child.

209
853
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,330
That girl isn't normal.

210
857
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,870
Why do you keep talking about the girl? Why does it matter?

211
861
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,270
- What is this?  
- What are you?

212
866
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,030
Is this a contest right now?

213
870
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,390
Hey, hey. Stay still. She's the history major that goes crazy when drunk.

214
874
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,510
Leave her alone.

215
878
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,530
It's so cool! Divorce is so cool.

216
882
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,440
Why does she have to be loya? They're both going to live separately now.

217
886
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,250
Ah, it's so cool!

218
890
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,760
Is the broadcasting club practicing a drama script?

219
894
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,920
Oh, yeah. They do radio dramas sometimes.

220
898
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,660
<i> This is from the broadcasting club.</i>

221
902
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,620
<i> The accident that happened previously is unrelated to us.</i>

222
906
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,190
<i> We are currently investigating what happened.</i>

223
910
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,430
- They divorced recently. 
 - His first love is from this school.

224
915
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,210
I really hate this.

225
919
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,100
Hey, apparently the guy's first love goes to this school.

226
923
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,150
What?

227
927
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,470
<i> What do we do now?</i>

228
931
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,340
<i> What am I supposed to do?</i>

229
935
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,410
Okay, so let's just forget about the guy for a second. What about the girl? She has a child at that age.

230
939
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:39,390
That bastard.

231
943
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,130
Cheon Seol? You swear?

232
947
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,330
He seduced an innocent girl and got her pregnant.

233
951
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,130
That bastard. I'm not letting him get away with this.

234
955
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,770
Hey, he didn't get her pregnant. They were married. A couple.

235
959
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,680
He isn't even giving her alimony!

236
963
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,880
But, why are you saying this to me?

237
967
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Anyway, they left the child because they didn't want to be responsible for him.

238
971
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,180
That doesn't make sense!

239
975
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,440
What's it with you two?

240
979
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,390
Everyone's freaking out right now about finding them.

241
983
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,210
There aren't many clues, but judging by how the couple fought so viciously,

242
987
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,830
they aren't on good terms. Hey, do you guys know anyone who fight for no reason like that?

243
991
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,060
They're harder to find usually if they're closer to you.

244
995
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:37,720
Hm... I, I wonder. Jin Joo, is there someone like that who you know?

245
999
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,170
I don't think so, Ban Do.

246
1003
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,610
Ah, I see. There isn't anyone like that.

247
1007
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,470
Eat it well!

248
1011
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,010
Is it refreshing?

249
1015
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,830
Mm! It's really refreshing.

250
1019
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,600
"Both of them said they aren't raising the child."

251
1023
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,460
"Both of them aren't even humans."

252
1027
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,690
"They say he always hit the girl."

253
1031
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,810
"Really? He's so trashy!"

254
1035
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,230
"She was a gold digger. She wanted alimony, so she intentionally planned it."

255
1039
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,850
"The boy's such trash!"

256
1043
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,940
"Same with the girl."

257
1047
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,860
The two are the same.

258
1051
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,940
The only thing revealed was our voice.

259
1055
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,430
I don't think anyone has caught on.

260
1059
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,700
Why are they calling a normal person like me a gold digger?

261
1063
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,900
You're the one who seduced me.

262
1067
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,390
Hey, I'm apparently an abuser.

263
1071
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,220
You're the one who would hit me, but I never even touched the tips of your hair.

264
1075
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,430
OK, whatever. But, we can't argue when we're in front of everyone.

265
1079
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,610
Got it.

266
1083
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,610
Why'd you take me to that broadcasting room?

267
1087
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,160
I didn't know how it would end.

268
1091
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,170
When I told you not to contact Director Park,

269
1095
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,130
you should've politely gone with it. Because you didn't, it turned into this mess!

270
1099
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,590
So, this is my fault?

271
1103
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,920
Then, is it mine?

272
1107
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,120
What are you two doing here? Whose fault is what?

273
1111
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,240
It's the blind date's fault. How we got this close.

274
1115
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,700
That's true. It's because of the meeting.

275
1119
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,490
Well, then.

276
1123
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,100
Let's go, Cheon Seol.

277
1127
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,930
We're going first, Ban Do.

278
1131
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,800
Okay, Jin Joo! Bye!

279
1135
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,350
Excuse me...

280
1139
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,030
The club.

281
1143
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,650
Director-

282
1147
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,540
Oh, the note!

283
1151
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,360
You remember.

284
1155
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,650
You're from this school, huh?

285
1159
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,350
Yesterday, on the stage, you were the best.

286
1163
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,720
But, I think I made a mistake yesterday.

287
1167
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,960
- What? 
 - I should've gotten your number.

288
1172
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,370
I gave you mine instead.

289
1176
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,850
But, it must be fate. We met again.

290
1180
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,410
Can you give me your number this time?

291
1184
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,230
Of course!

292
1188
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,970
That stupid woman.

293
1192
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,610
Here, you go. My number.

294
1196
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,820
I'll contact you.

295
1200
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,450
Okay! Then ...

296
1204
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,540
She has to be hit in the back of her head to understand.

297
1208
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,040
Who does he think he is?

298
1212
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,160
Who?

299
1216
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,710
What? It's nothing.

300
1220
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,320
I don't know. It isn't my business.

301
1224
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,140
Who is it?

302
1228
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,160
It's nothing.

303
1232
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,780
<i>Hey, excuse me! Move aside!</i>

304
1236
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,240
Why does she keep appearing in front of me?

305
1240
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,300
Are you really going to do it?

306
1244
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,520
I have to do something.

307
1248
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,010
Please save me!

308
1252
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:39,570
Please save me! Please save me!

309
1256
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:50,440
After class, don't be late and come to the reference library.

310
1260
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,700
It's an event for the freshman.

311
1264
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,160
Everyone should attend.

312
1268
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,050
- Got it? 
 - Yes.

313
1273
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,860
<i>Is he here to complain about something?</i>

314
1277
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,670
<i> Wow, would you look at how thin his face got?</i>

315
1281
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:25,550
<i>Still, he's already given false hope to someone who's already confessed to him, among others.</i>

316
1285
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:31,330
<i>But... Did he really not marry for 18 years because he couldn't forget me?</i>

317
1289
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,820
Hey.

318
1293
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,370
Hey?

319
1297
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,140
I'm asking because I want to make sure.

320
1301
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,340
You don't think I like you, right?

321
1305
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,830
What?

322
1309
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,820
Uh... <i> What is he saying?</i>

323
1313
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,940
It's true.

324
1317
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,640
Wow. You really thought it was that.

325
1321
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,790
I mean, you confessed to me.

326
1325
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,610
I never confessed to you.

327
1329
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,590
I mean, you asked me out.

328
1333
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,690
I only asked you out, I didn't say I liked you.

329
1337
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,090
What?

330
1341
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,890
<i> What is he doing? Is he getting revenge now because he was rejected?</i>

331
1345
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,350
Well, you normally have to like someone to date them.

332
1349
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,550
- Then, why'd you ask me out? 
 - Because you were in front of me.

333
1354
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,540
Because I was in front of you? What if someone else was?

334
1358
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,400
I would've asked her out.

335
1362
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,760
You understand now, right? So, don't flirt with me.

336
1366
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,050
Like... this.

337
1370
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,370
That kind of thing.

338
1374
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,990
Don't do it.

339
1378
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,610
I'm going.

340
1382
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,360
So, you ask someone in front of you to date you?

341
1386
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,410
What is that? Then..

342
1390
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,650
In the past, he never liked me.

343
1394
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,830
Why'd he tell me now after 18 years?

344
1398
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,760
He shouldn't have told me.

345
1402
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,560
He shouldn't have.

346
1406
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,480
<i>It's Yoon Bo Reum.</i>

347
1410
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,600
<i>Tomorrow, come to room 201 in the Student's Building at 2 P.M.</i>

348
1414
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,890
Put strength into it!

349
1418
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,930
With spirit!

350
1422
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,920
Who are you?

351
1426
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:59,790
Application for Asura Cheerleading.

352
1430
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:07,560
Are you kidding me? My body isn't fit for that kind of thing.

353
1434
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,940
But, I wrote this?

354
1438
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,280
It's true. You wrote it.

355
1442
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,530
It's your handwriting.

356
1446
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:20,100
Yeah, that's true. This fingerprint... Is it mine?

357
1450
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,000
Hey! I don't make drunk people do weird things like that.

358
1454
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,370
<i>- What's that? 
 - Oh, this?</i>

359
1459
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:35,260
<i>It's the application for my club. I'm going to give it to people who want to join it.</i>

360
1463
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,120
<i>You want to do it?</i>

361
1467
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,400
<i>Me?</i>

362
1471
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,500
<i>If you do it, you'll be practicing next to me every day.</i>

363
1475
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,570
<i>Really?</i>

364
1479
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,450
<i>Should I do it?</i>

365
1483
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,170
<i>Ahn Jae Woo</i>

366
1487
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,810
<i>Ahn Jae Woo</i>

367
1491
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,270
<i>Asura</i>

368
1495
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,100
3, 4,

369
1499
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,530
1, 2! Match the rhythm!

370
1503
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,280
Hey! Did you go on a nationwide tour?

371
1507
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,030
Why are you having so much trouble?

372
1511
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,950
Do it again!

373
1515
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,610

What? What?

385
1563
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,260
Min Seo Young! Come to your senses!

386
1567
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,300
It's obvious when the main solo has a rough and heavy body.

387
1571
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,050
Are you really going to control your weight like this?

388
1575
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,990
I am... But I'm the type to not be able to gain or lose weight easily.

389
1579
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,690
Is that an excuse?

390
1583
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,270
You guys should drink these, too.

391
1587
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,800
Here, here.

392
1591
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,560
I'm on a diet, though.

393
1595
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,660
I have to diet...

394
1599
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,080
It's good!

395
1603
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,510
Seo Young! Come here. He brought snacks for you.

396
1607
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,800
Hi. You must've been somewhere just now.

397
1611
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,700
Yeah... Hi.

398
1615
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,490
Come, sit.

399
1619
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,580
I thought your sugar levels dropped, so I brought these sugary things.

400
1623
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,640
Wow, you have good sense!

401
1627
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,290
When we practice a lot, we crave sugary things.

402
1631
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,950
How'd you know?

403
1635
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,380
I read about it.

404
1639
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,880
Life is always bitter. Practice, too.

405
1643
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,590
You have to eat sugary things from time to time so you can endure the bitter times to get to the sweet taste.

406
1647
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,580
- You have a point. 
 - You're fun.

407
1652
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,580
Here. It won't get on your fingers if you eat it like this.

408
1656
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,100
No, I'm good.

409
1660
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,800
I think I have an upset stomach.

410
1664
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,210
Oh, really?

411
1668
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,580
What is he doing?

412
1672
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,750
He's not her boyfriend, right?

413
1676
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,870
I've never been able to talk to Seo Young.

414
1680
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,290
Hey, guys! Come here. Let's eat together.

415
1684
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,230
Us?

416
1688
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,860
Is he calling us?

417
1692
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,010
Yeah, you guys.

418
1696
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,780
So, I hope everyone can practice hard and well.

419
1700
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,100
When you're about to forget me, I'll come again with sugary things.

420
1704
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,940
Hey... I'm going.

421
1708
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,510
I'm going! Bye!

422
1712
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,700
Bye! Come again!

423
1716
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,500
I didn't know, but he's pretty alright!

424
1720
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,420
<i> It's so perfect! I've attacked her surroundings.</i>

425
1724
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,620
I think he likes you a lot, when we look at how he's been treating us.

426
1728
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,710
Is that it?

427
1732
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,550
Thanks for the food. You thought about us, too.

428
1736
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,520
<i> That was all planned out, too.</i>

429
1740
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,820
<i> Midlife relaxation.</i>

430
1744
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,600
Yeah. Good luck!

431
1748
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,860
Seo Young! Are you okay? Get up!

432
1752
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,210
What do we do?

433
1756
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,970
What is this? What happened?

434
1760
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,280
Don't we have to call 119? (<i>119 is like 911)</i>

435
1764
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,450
- Can you help me? 
- Yeah.

436
1769
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,120
- Where's the nurse's room? 
 - At the end after you take a right.

437
1774
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,180
What do we do?

438
1778
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,000
Is she a feather? Why is she so skinny?

439
1782
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,070
Attention! Over there is the reference library.

440
1786
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,790
You probably heard rumors.  A long time ago

441
1790
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:41,080
but inside, a freshman once hanged herself.

442
1794
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,560
After that, people have been saying they saw the ghost.

443
1798
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,060
If one person goes inside

444
1802
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,320
and finds the designated reference data,

445
1806
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,310
we will buy you all drinks.

446
1810
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:07,070
No one has succeeded so far.

447
1814
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,300
- We're going in there? 
 - I'm scared.

448
1819
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,010
<i> Don't Look Back!</i>

449
1823
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,620
How is that scary? They're overreacting.

450
1827
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,970
Absolutely overreacting.

451
1831
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,020
What is it?

452
1835
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,800
Is it real?

453
1839
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,250
It's real! A real ghost!

454
1843
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,550
Gosh, this is so scary!

455
1847
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,750
Who's going next?

456
1851
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,810
What is this? No one?

457
1855
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,800
At least one more person should go.

458
1859
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,690
This year, too, no one will find it.

459
1863
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,350
No one is going in.

460
1867
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,820
Ma Jin Joo?

461
1871
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,200
Did a ghost really appear or something?

462
1875
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,300
Be brave.

463
1879
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,780
Gosh, that scared me!

464
1883
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,350
<i> Mom, I'm so scared!</i>

465
1887
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,300
Geez, that scared me!

466
1891
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,920
Ugh, what is this?

467
1895
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,350
<i> Don't come after me!</i>

468
1899
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,720
<i> Don't come closer!</i>

469
1903
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,040
Senior...

470
1907
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,980
Senior!

471
1911
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:58,350
I remember you were hiding there. Did you think you would fool me twice?

472
1915
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,350
One more of them left after being frightened.

473
1919
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,300
Why did that freshman die here?

474
1923
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,340
How scary.

475
1927
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:27,860
Okay, I sent all of them out. Let's find the reference data now.

476
1931
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:39,460
I saw it.  OMG I saw it!

477
1935
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,050
Did we end or what?

478
1939
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,280
Red envelope..

479
1943
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,480
Let's see. Red envelope..

480
1947
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,270
I found it.

481
1951
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:20,260
Oh, here.

482
1955
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,270
Thanks to me, everyone will have a great meal today.

483
1959
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,830
How is this fun?

484
1963
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:32,310
Oh, kids.

485
1967
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:55,870
♫ <i> Baby, inside your clear eyes</i> ♫

486
1971
00:37:55,870 --> 00:38:01,490
♫ <i>I want to be in your eyes and I want to feel your heart forever</i> ♫

487
1975
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:07,020
♫ <i>Your lovely voice</i> ♫

488
1979
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:14,540
♫ <i>I want to be swept by you as if to throw myself at you</i> ♫

489
1983
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:23,150
♫ <i>I'm lacking a lot now</i> ♫

490
1987
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,910
♫ <i>In my heart, in my eyes</i> ♫

491
1991
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:34,140
♫ <i>I wish you can see my genuine heart</i> ♫

492
1995
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,960
I woke up because of my stomach.

493
1999
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,980
You must've heard it, too.

494
2003
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,790
What?

495
2007
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,580
If you're up, let's go.

496
2011
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,780
Where?

497
2015
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,310
You two should never be separated.

498
2019
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,720
Oh, yes. This is it. It's so good!

499
2023
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,930
What are you doing? I'm not eating.

500
2027
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,440
- Yeah. Don't eat.  
- What?

501
2032
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,330
The nurse said you're watching your weight right now.

502
2036
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,990
Don't eat it and then blame me. Just don't eat it.

503
2040
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,490
Then why am I sitting here?

504
2044
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,700
Hold on. It's so good!

505
2048
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,540
Just watch me eat.

506
2052
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,000
I wanted to eat pork belly so bad, but I didn't have any friends to eat it with.

507
2056
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,500
We have each other's number. You could do this.

508
2060
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,140
- Do you just want one? Just one.
 - What?

509
2065
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,890
Never mind. What am I doing to someone who's controlling her weight?

510
2069
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,770
No, no. I'm sorry.

511
2073
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,450
Hey!

512
2077
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:30,400
Am I just a sidekick? Why should I just watch? I can eat just one.

513
2081
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,130
You can't...

514
2085
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,170
It's so good!

515
2089
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:56,440
You. I thought you were only going to eat one.

516
2093
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,930
I meant one... meal. I'm eating one meal.

517
2097
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:09,330
I see. Yeah, eat up.

518
2101
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,730
If you eat well, you don't gain weight. It's 0 calories.

519
2105
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,240
What are you saying?

520
2109
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,140
There's something like that.

521
2113
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,240
<i>How silly.</i>

522
2117
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,040
<i>Why would I get nervous there? To a kid?</i>

523
2121
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:43,190
I mean... This is my first time coming this far in this event.

524
2125
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,950
If you were hidden, you should've said so.

525
2129
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,520
If I were to tell you, why would I be hiding?

526
2133
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,120
That's true, but...

527
2137
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,200
<i> Gosh, he's sassy.</i>

528
2141
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,930
I told you not to flirt with me.

529
2145
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,860
I don't think I did this time.

530
2149
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:01,020
You were the one who saved me yourself.

531
2153
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,160
I'm sure you saved me because I was right in front of you, but.. Thank you.

532
2157
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,450
I think everything's finished. Are you not leaving?

533
2161
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,590
I'm fine, you can go first.

534
2165
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,660
Oh, my. Did you get hurt?

535
2169
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,380
Let me see.

536
2173
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,420
Hey, hey! Why are you touching a man's leg?

537
2177
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,760
Oh, you! <i> He thinks he's a man.</i>

538
2181
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,980
Let me see.

539
2185
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,010
Oh, it's swollen!

540
2189
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:46,810
You should've saved me carefully! It looks painful.

541
2193
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,430
If you sprain it, it lasts forever.

542
2197
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:55,640
Just move it a little.

543
2201
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,390
Leave me be.

544
2205
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,740
Why do you keep talking informally to me?

545
2209
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,260
Hey, what are you doing?

546
2213
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,570
Just go. You can't walk anyway.

547
2217
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,450
I told you not to do these things.

548
2221
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,030
Walk carefully.

549
2225
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,440
Thank you for the food!

550
2229
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,190
I've lost my mind.

551
2233
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,740
Miss, I'll have this.

552
2237
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,590
Let's go. Because you ate with enjoyment, we have to make it zero calories.

553
2241
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,000
What?

554
2245
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:33,380
Instead of getting stressed from not being able to do what you want, isn't it better to just do it?

555
2249
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,110
We're all just trying to eat and live.

556
2253
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:38,940
Eating what you want isn't as harsh as I thought.

557
2257
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,530
Life isn't always harsh and tough.

558
2261
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:45,270
If you do what you want, everything ends up working out.

559
2265
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:49,660
Instead of getting pregnant women stressed because they can't have coffee or alcohol,

560
2269
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,430
the doctors say to have it once in a while if they want to so badly.

561
2273
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,710
That doesn't make sense. To a pregnant woman?

562
2277
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:57,720
It's true. My wife-

563
2281
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:04,120
...When my sister was pregnant, she said it.

564
2285
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,380
What's with you so suddenly?

565
2289
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,170
Huh? What?

566
2293
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,250
Well...

567
2297
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:21,360
Before this, you used to not be able to talk to me. You ran away and hid.

568
2301
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,210
What?

569
2305
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:27,140
But, suddenly you've asked for my number and you come find me first.

570
2309
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,370
You just seem like a different person.

571
2313
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:33,430
You knew that I used to hide?

572
2317
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:37,710
Yeah. It was the first time I saw someone who hid so badly.

573
2321
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:48,950
Forget who I was in the past. He was like a fool, right?

574
2325
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,070
What's the meaning behind that smile?

575
2329
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,630
♫  <i> I'm thinking I'm in love... ♫</i>

576

579
2345
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,410
Oh, right. The air in Seoul used to be like this.

580
2349
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,930
Without all the fine dust, the sight is so clear!

581
2353
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,960
What's that? Fine dust?

582
2357
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,930
There's something like that. Air from China.

583
2361
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:33,680
China sells air?

584
2365
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,280
In the future, probably.

585
2369
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,070
What are you saying?

Huh? Oh..

592

00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,660
I eyeballed it.

593
2402
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:05,120

To the people who forget history, there is no future for them!

597
2418
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:40,960
I didn't think Ma Jin Joo would succeed. How amazing!

598
2422
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,440
Ma Jin Joo! Ma Jin Joo!

599
2426
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,950
Ghosts? What's so scary about them? People are scarier.

600
2430
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,230
This.

601
2434
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,710
You should use this. It looked swollen earlier.

602
2438
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,240
You don't have to worry.

603
2442
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,970
Wow, you're bad at listening to people.

604
2446
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,120
Move. Here.

605
2450
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:25,720
Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

606
2454
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:32,120
You got hurt because of me. I have a duty. How could I not care?

607
2458
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:37,230
It's not like you have 2nd year middle schooler disease.What kind of man is so prim.

608
2462
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:42,410
Don't remove it. Keep it on until all the inflammation goes down. Got it?

609
2466
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,590
Jin Joo, where'd you go?

610
2470
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,280
Let's drink!

611
2474
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,750
What is this? Is she a doctor?

612
2478
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:57,360
Ah, so refreshing!

613
2482
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,780
Cheers!

614
2486
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,810
Why does she keep speaking informally?

615
2490
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,340
It's so great!

616
2494
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,880
Jin Joo, you need to drain it in one go!

617
2498
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,030
No, no. Let it be. Never mind. Let's go for it. Who's gonna set it up?

618
2502
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:20,600
One shot! One shot!

619
2506
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,730
There!

620
2510
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,500
It's so refreshing.

621
2514
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:43,780
Cheon Seol. Why are you drinking juice?

622
2518
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,370
You and I usually don't drink alcohol.

623
2522
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,300
But, still. Let's drink.

624
2526
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,220
When you get married later, you're not going to be able to drink because there's no time.

625
2530
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,860
Married?

626
2534
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,310
Still, I don't like looking at people get loose after drinking is a bit weird.

627
2538
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:12,960
Seol, you know it's okay to kinda be a bit loose.

628
2542
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,640
If you don't play when you need to play because of what others might think of you, you're the only one who loses.

629
2546
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,010
You know there's a time for it all too!

630
2550
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:22,580
When you do it when you get old, that's even more of an eyesore.

631
2554
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,240
Right now, it's

632
2558
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,490
the perfect time to drink and have fun.

633
2562
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:32,800
Hey, guys. Today, drink what you want

634
2566
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,480
without worrying about what others think.

635
2570
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:41,510
For the people who don't know their history, there's no future.

636
2574
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,720
There's no future! None!

637
2578
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,080
<i> To the people who forget their history, there is no future.</i>

638
2582
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,330
Hey. What's Cheon Seol doing over there?

639
2586
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:07,440
I should take this with me.

640
2590
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,830
This spicy one, too.

641
2594
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,170
Fried and spicy, half half!

642
2598
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,420
That hurt!

643
2602
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,020
Hey, did the table not break?

644
2606
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,650
I think the table's crushed.

645
2610
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,710
Seniors, please take Cheon Seol back safely.

646
2614
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,430
Please take me back safely!

647
2618
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:02,350
Roll call! Cheon Seol can't miss roll call.

648
2622
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:05,800
There's still a lot of time left until roll call.

649
2626
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,410
Hey, you should just go.

650
2630
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:15,660
Okay. I will go.

669
2708
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:02,390
Let me know if you want to let it out. I'll always help make your encore.

670
2712
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:08,280
You're too young to hold things in. Right?

671
2716
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:14,400
No... Thanks for today. But, don't do that again.

672
2720
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:20,760
I've never not been first place in the youth competitions.

673
2724
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:26,630
I got this far because I've stayed strong and endured it all.

674
2728
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,940
Not just luck.

675
2732
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,130
Thanks, though.

676
2736
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,820
I want to get to know you better.

677
2740
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,430
Oh, the bus is coming.

678
2744
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:47,950
I'm going.

679
2748
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:50,370
Okay, bye!

680
2752
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,860
Bye!

681
2756
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:08,580
Yes!! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!!

682
2760
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,760
I did good. I did good.

683
2764
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,800
It's hot at this time, too.

684
2768
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,010
Summer is summer.

685
2772
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,610
Honey.

686
2776
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:03,790
I said it's hot! It's hot!

687
2780
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:10,130
Hey. It's hot!

688
2784
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,610
I didn't go back.

689
2788
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,810
Oh?

690
2792
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:51,440
What is this? Why are you doing the dishes?

691
2796
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,540
Are you going to get married?

692
2800
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:58,440
Do you have to marry to do the dishes? You can rest, Mom.

693
2804
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,240
Move away. You're going to do it for the rest of your life when you marry, anyway. Why start already?

694
2808
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,900
Mom, you're going to do it until you die.

695
2812
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,850
Did you get mature?

696
2816
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:13,200
I don't know when that immaturity will return, so when that happens just think that's how it is.

697
2820
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,330
What are you saying?

698
2824
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,240
Just rest.

699
2828
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,490
Sit, Mom. Rest!

700
2832
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:25,410
Look at this.

701
2836
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,370
How much is this?

702
2840
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:30,520
₩5,000.

703
2844
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,440
This is ₩5,000.

704
2848
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,010
Mom, you like grapes.

705
2852
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,210
Oh, you're right. They look good.

706
2856
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:41,000
It's okay. I'm the only one who would eat it, anyway.

707
2860
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,120
You and your dad go crazy over watermelon.

708
2864
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:51,100
Just buy it. I'm just wild about wanting to eat grapes today.

709
2868
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,330
Grapes? You don't even eat them.

710
2872
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:57,360
I love grapes! Because I take after you.

711
2876
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:11,140
Oh, right. I forgot to get the pictures.

712
2880
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,220
Gosh, look at my state of mind.

713
2884
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,180
The photographer next to the market? - yeah.

714
2888
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,560
Mom, you can go. I'll get it.

715
2892
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,040
Sorry.

716
2896
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,930
To Ms. Go Eun Sook.

717
2900
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:40,670
Oh, who left this here?

718
2904
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,560
Young man

719
2908
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,830
If you bump into someone, you should apologize.

720
2912
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:08,380
Because of you, don't you see what you did!

721
2916
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,480
Then, you should be holding onto them properly!

722
2920
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,910
What?

723
2924
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,430
I'm right in front of my house. You bumped into me.

724
2928
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:20,430
What's up with this ajumma! From the morning, how unlucky.

725
2932
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:24,050
So, what. What do you want me to do?

726
2936
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:26,400
This person..

727
2940
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:30,710
What's with you! You tiny thing to an adult!

728
2944
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,630
What?

729
2948
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:38,210
Wow, what's with today? What's with this neighborhood?

730
2952
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,700
If you bump an adult you need to sincerely apologize

731
2956
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:45,110
or compensate. You young thing!

732
2960
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:48,070
Yeah! You little bastard.

733
2964
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:51,980
Wow. You must both be crazy.

734
2968
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,000
What's with you? Who are you to interfere!

735
2972
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,470
Me?

736
2976
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,530
I'm her son. Why?

737
2980
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:06,320
Son? No wonder.

738
2984
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:11,140
You two better consider yourselves lucky.

739
2988
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,690
What?

740
2992
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:15,770
Has no manners that kid.

741
2996
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,940
Are you okay?

742
3000
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,690
Oh, yes.

743
3004
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:31,600
Thank you.

744
3008
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:37,420
Your mom must be so proud. I only have two daughters.

745
3012
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:48,350
You're sending your daughter off, what's with your expression?

746
3016
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:51,030
Your expression is so happy.

747
3020
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:57,070
Of course it's a celebration! In a son-less household, I got a son like this for free!

748
3024
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,830
You must be so happy.

749
3028
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,540
Hey!

750
3032
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:12,620
Oh, my!

751
3036
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,450
Mom, go inside.

752
3040
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:19,670
Hey, what's with you? This student...

753
3044
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:24,300
Mom, just go inside first.

754
3048
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,370
Just go.

755
3052
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,990
I was just passing by.

756
3056
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:42,610
Why did you come here?

757
3060
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,050
Did you come to see Mom?

758
3064
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:10,030
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry Mother-in-Law.

759
3068
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:15,010
I'm so sorry!

01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:01,060
You're weird these days. Not only do you dream I'm dead.

763
3084
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:04,200
- Are you dating Yoon Bo Reum? 
 - Dating?

3089
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,470
It wasn't even a kiss, it was a slight peck.

765
3093
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,490
It's not as good if you eat by yourself.

766
3097
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,870
It's here right?

767
3101
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:13,230
Did I do something wrong?

768
3105
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:14,610
It's not like I'm cheating!

769
3109
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:15,790
Why is she here?

770
3113
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:17,750
You said we'd go to the hospital. Why are we here?

771
3117
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:21,370
You told me not to flirt and that you didn't confess.

772
3121
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:24,310
It's not a confession. I'm in the process of seducing.
