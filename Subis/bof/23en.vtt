1
3
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,199
Are you  okay?

2
7
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,299
Yeah.

3
11
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,966
Even if you weren't okay, you're not the type who would tell me.

4
15
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:13,233
I'm really okay.

5
19
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:15,877
Wait just a little while.

6
23
00:01:16,818 --> 00:01:18,489
This time, honestly,

7
27
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:21,624
even if I have to leave my home,

8
31
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:24,524
I'm going to protect you.

9
35
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:26,822
What are you saying?

10
39
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:30,140
The Witch's

11
43
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,400
personality isn't the kind to sit back and do nothing.

12
47
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,521
She's definitely up to something.

13
51
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:39,222
I'm just saying that I'll be preparing, too.

14
55
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:40,589
Don't do that.

15
59
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:42,627
What?

16
63
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,931
Whatever you do, you have to be the reason for it.

17
67
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,685
I don't want you protecting me.

18
71
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:49,079
Why do you not like it?

19
75
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:52,971
Because you're my girl, it's a given that I'd protect you.

20
79
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,136
Someone protecting someone else; someone guarding over someone else...

21
83
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:01,905
If it's only sustainable by that... I don't like it.

22
87
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:09,663
Until now, I've already received so much from you, F4 sunbaes, even Jae Kyung unnie.

23
91
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:14,850
At the very least, I want for you and I to be on equal footing.

24
95
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,265
As I overcome what needs to be overcome.

25
99
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,851
Do you know?

26
103
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:21,366
What?

27
107
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:24,083
You're the type of girl on whom

28
111
00:02:24,723 --> 00:02:26,669
"cuteness" is wasted.

29
115
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:38,300
Huh, what's wrong with you?

30
119
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:39,900
Chan!  (the boy's name) What's wrong?

31
123
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:42,100
Why are you so sad? What's wrong?

32
127
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:45,817
What?!

33
131
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,560
Is this the time to be laughing?

34
135
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:51,590
Hold it in.  You'd better hold it in!

35
139
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:10,750
Chan,  what is that?

36
143
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:12,618
Can you see  that?

37
147
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:14,055
You can't see  it well, huh?

38
151
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:18,809
Let me ride on your shoulders, okay?

39
155
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:19,567
what?

40
159
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,664
A shoulder ride.

41
163
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:24,650
Is it fun? 
 Yes.

42
168
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,800
He's going to fall. 
No, I'm not going to fall.

43
173
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,933
It must be spring . . .

44
177
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,552
the weather's mellowed.

45
181
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:55,538
It's weird.

46
185
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:56,800
What is?

47
189
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,518
I feel as though

48
193
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:03,639
I'm in a vague dream

49
197
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,350
that I've had before.

50
201
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,450
I'm just saying...

51
205
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,413
How come this small kid's so heavy!

52
209
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,583
Hey, Manager Jung.

53
213
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,316
Young master, I think you'd better come back now.

54
217
00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:29,583
Madam Chairman will find you.

55
221
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:50,450
Chan... Oops...

56
225
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:57,918
Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! I love you Yi Jung! Happy birthday to you!

57
229
00:05:57,918 --> 00:05:59,720
Happy birthday, Yi Jung.

58
233
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:03,221
Come on, you should make a wish and blow out the candles.

59
237
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:27,384
This is a gift.

60
241
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:51,059
"One meeting, one opportunity "

61
245
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:52,723
What does it mean?

62
249
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,666
A once-in-a-lifetime   fate.

63
253
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:11,714
Ga Eul.

64
257
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:16,718
Yi Jung  sunbae...

65
261
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,106
I found it.

66
265
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:20,569
What?

67
269
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,842
I finally found it.

68
273
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:13,937
<i>"I love you, Yi Jung"</i>

69
277
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,552
On that day

70
281
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:27,887
sunrise was at 7:00 am.

71
285
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:35,030
This was only visible right at sunrise, for just a few seconds.

72
289
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:37,657
That message.

73
293
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:48,710
Idiot.

74
297
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,415
Even knowing I was an idiot . . .

75
301
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:58,114
She knew it better than anyone in the whole world.

76
305
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:00,956
How could she give me such a tough problem to solve?

77
309
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:18,472
Yi Jung.

78
313
00:09:19,573 --> 00:09:23,544
I really would like for you to show up.

79
317
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:28,850
The breeze...

80
321
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,689
can't go back to a place it has already left, Yi Jung.

81
325
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,692
Do it over! Do it over!

82
329
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:39,861
Let me redo it!

83
333
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:13,134
Yesterday, the lovely spring weather

84
337
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:19,100
brought out many families to the city zoo, where flowers were in full bloom.

85
341
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,188
Mr. President.

86
345
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:16,457
Are you serious about keeping this buried?

87
349
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:20,929
Even if they say it was an accident that a zealot committed?

88
353
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:23,999
It's not as though it would bring these two back to life.

89
357
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:28,637
I can't let Ji Hoo see his father and mother's death

90
361
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:32,007
be used in political strife.

91
365
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,424
President.

92
369
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:54,663
I had no fear about something that I always believed was right.

93
373
00:11:57,232 --> 00:12:04,706
But it wasn't until after I lost them that I realized that that was also a form of arrogance. . .

94
377
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:10,345
It was because of the fear that I might also lose you...

95
381
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:17,319
The years that I was unable to see you was my punishment.

96
385
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:27,062
When you should have been blaming your Grandfather, 
 you had been living with that terrible burden.

97
390
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:32,000
Now, even if I die,

98
394
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,336
I have no regrets, child.

99
398
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:39,808
Can I ask that you take care of

100
402
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,510
the Foundation and the clinic?

101
406
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:55,657
It was your father and mother's wish to cure the heart by the arts and to cure illness by medical practice

102
410
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:58,960
Grandfather, I'm not yet...

103
414
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:05,133
Come over here!

104
418
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:07,469
Spicy fish soup is ready!

105
422
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,074
He he, that kid sure has a loud voice.

106
426
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:18,913
You're going to chase away all the fish with that loud voice of yours!

107
430
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,920
Is it all done?

108
434
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,041
Yes.

109
438
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,765
How is it?

110
442
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:39,893
You rascal, know that I'll eat it because I don't want to waste the perfectly good fish.

111
446
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:46,107
Ji Hoo, why don't you taste it?

112
450
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:58,887
Amazingly, it tastes a lot like your mom's.

113
454
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:08,363
Ok, you two, look over here!

114
458
00:14:08,363 --> 00:14:11,132
one...two...three!

115
462
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:38,827
I have good news and bad news.

116
466
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:41,663
Which one do you want to hear first?

117
470
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,670
Ah, I know your style.

118
474
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:50,939
Bad news first?

119
478
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:56,544
I probably will not

120
482
00:14:56,544 --> 00:14:58,913
be as good as before.

121
486
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:04,953
This hand...

122
490
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:08,289
whether the pottery gods will choose it again,

123
494
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:10,325
I don't know.

124
498
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:13,595
No, it won't be that way.  They will.

125
502
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:20,201
But, what's the good news?

126
506
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:24,305
Even with all that, the fact that I will continue.

127
510
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,042
I'm not going to avoid it anymore.

128
514
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:33,348
If you give up once, how much you regret it...

129
518
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:35,183
I learned thanks to you.

130
522
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:38,052
Sunbae.

131
526
00:15:40,054 --> 00:15:42,390
Ga Eul, do you want to try it?

132
530
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:59,191
How did you know that I would listen bad news first?

133
534
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,587
Because good girls like happy endings.

134
538
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:26,285
I definitely am a cool guy, but not a good guy.

135
542
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:33,286
You need to get rid of your misconception that good girls want good guys.

136
546
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:53,269
Yes, mom.

137
550
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,254
What?

138
554
00:16:56,587 --> 00:16:57,971
Is that true?

139
558
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:00,374
All right.

140
562
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:02,464
I'll be there right away.

141
566
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:22,683
We worked really hard through the Foundation,

142
570
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:26,105
and the hard efforts of a lot of people went into this.

143
574
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:31,547
Jan Di, take a walk around.

144
578
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:32,348
Okay.

145
582
00:17:38,082 --> 00:17:39,624
It's quite something, isn't it?

146
586
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,390
It's so spacious.

147
590
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,832
Oh! What's that grandpa?

148
594
00:17:42,832 --> 00:17:45,253
Over there are all meeting rooms.

149
598
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:48,074
Hold on a second.

150
602
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:51,209
Yes, it's me.

151
606
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,570
Hey, is that true?

152
610
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:57,713
Who would have the nerve?

153
614
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,410
How on earth did this situation come about?

154
618
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:04,871
No!

155
622
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:08,450
Whatever happens, we must take care of the foundation!

156
626
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:11,987
No!

157
630
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:17,126
Grandpa! Grandpa!

158
634
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:19,428
Grandpa!  Grandpa!

159
638
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:21,230
Grandpa, your medicine!  The medicine!

160
642
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:32,641
Sunbae! The hospital, the hospital!

161
646
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:27,235
He did not want you to know.

162
650
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:31,832
He said he'd be fine as long as he was careful.

163
654
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:39,808
Let's go and get Grandfather's things.

164
658
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,739
The preparations are going well, I presume

165
662
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,404
Chairwoman,

166
666
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:11,106
Apart from anything else,

167
670
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:13,509
could you reconsider regarding the Sooam Foundation?

168
674
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:17,379
You know better than anyone that

169
678
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:19,584
I'm not doing this out of greed for the silly foundation.

170
682
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:24,520
What are you intending to do?

171
686
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,518
At this chance, I'm going to pull it out the roots.

172
690
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:33,295
It's so fortunate that that little upstart child values something more than money.

173
694
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:44,636
I have a proposition.

174
698
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:46,708
A proposition?

175
702
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:48,477
The fact that the marriage didn't happen...

176
706
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:51,313
I'm sorry about that.

177
710
00:20:52,347 --> 00:20:53,749
But...

178
714
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:57,853
it's not like the ties are completely cut with JK Group.

179
718
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,023
I will do my utmost to save it.

180
722
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:02,791
Trust in me.

181
726
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:06,094
And so what?

182
730
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:11,199
Whether you put spies on me or keep me locked up.

183
734
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:13,201
I'll take whatever you dish out.

184
738
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:14,937
Except.

185
742
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:16,171
Except...

186
746
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,207
leave Jan Di

187
750
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:21,109
alone.

188
754
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:27,082
If I don't do anything to Geum Jan Di, then is that enough?

189
758
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:29,551
Yes.

190
762
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:31,920
I'll make that promise.

191
766
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:36,425
I won't lift a finger against Geum Jan Di.

192
770
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:39,127
In return

193
774
00:21:39,127 --> 00:21:42,331
don't forget what you've said just now.

194
778
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:43,999
Don't worry.

195
782
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:25,941
This isn't the time to be moping around.

196
786
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,211
Granny?

197
790
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:39,554
Do you still not know your mother?

198
794
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:42,557
This is not the time for you to feel at ease.

199
798
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:46,795
When you can't even take care of your own girl,

200
802
00:22:46,795 --> 00:22:50,732
how do you plan on taking care of Shin Hwa Group in the future?

201
806
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:57,639
I did not raise you to be such a pathetic person.

202
810
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:01,543
Just because a person is born as a male doesn't mean you're automatically a man.

203
814
00:23:02,544 --> 00:23:06,381
Since you're furious at your defeat, you can't bear to step back,

204
818
00:23:06,381 --> 00:23:09,618
and you're embarrassed about running away,

205
822
00:23:09,618 --> 00:23:15,557
you overcome your weak character over time.

206
826
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:19,494
That's how you become a real man.

207
830
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:22,664
Do you understand?

208
834
00:23:29,838 --> 00:23:31,006
Granny!

209
838
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,678
Thank you.

210
842
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:23,385
<i>Ji Hoo in Kindergarten</i>

211
846
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:29,758
<i> JiHoo in elementary school</i>

212
850
00:25:51,646 --> 00:25:52,948
<i>JiHoo in college.</i>

213
854
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:36,324
Ga Eul...

214
858
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:42,697
Didn't you say your father had tenure of 20 years at his company?

215
862
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:45,450
It hasn't even been that long since he was promoted to assistant manager.

216
866
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:55,006
Why did they suddenly force only your dad to resign?

217
870
00:26:57,605 --> 00:27:00,231
Why did they do it?

218
874
00:27:15,294 --> 00:27:16,883
Seriously?

219
878
00:27:16,883 --> 00:27:22,356
ShinHwa's Group subcontracting company forced Ga Eul's dad to resign, all those things in just one morning?

220
882
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:24,107
It looks like it.

221
886
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,652
I was wondering why she didn't do anything after the wedding.

222
890
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:32,622
Then again it seems Ji Hoo has been put into a mess too.

223
894
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:34,956
Ji Hoo, why?

224
898
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:38,587
It seems Chairman Kang is going to take over Ji Hoo's foundation as well.

225
902
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:39,576
What?

226
906
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:43,045
The development of the new art center in Song-do has already been postponed.

227
910
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:44,654
Then...

228
914
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,460
This is all?

229
918
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,778
Her plan to destroy the one, Geum Jan Di.

230
922
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:13,183
Grandfather...

231
926
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:18,337
Jan Di,  I'm glad you came.

232
930
00:28:18,337 --> 00:28:19,556
Why?

233
934
00:28:19,556 --> 00:28:21,933
Did you miss me in that short period of time?

234
938
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:24,094
You and your delusional thinking!

235
942
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:29,169
Jan Di, since you're here, why don't you take that boy out of here?

236
946
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:33,488
He's completely stuck on me and won't move an inch.

237
950
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:35,839
It's suffocating.

238
954
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:43,613
Why aren't you guys both getting out of here?

239
958
00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:46,392
On such a beautiful spring day!

240
962
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:50,206
You young, pathetic things,

241
966
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,588
Get out of here now!

242
970
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,902
Let's go.

243
974
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:19,476
<i>The development of the new art center has already been postponed.</i>

244
978
00:30:19,476 --> 00:30:20,744
<i>So, this is . . .</i>

245
982
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,796
<i>her plan to destroy the one, Geum Jan Di.</i>

246
986
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:51,408
The desire to protect someone,

247
990
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:53,510
I never thought would develop in me.

248
994
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:58,389
But since I met you,

249
998
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:01,351
I've started developing it.

250
1002
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,856
Grandfather, the clinic,

251
1006
00:31:07,224 --> 00:31:09,433
the Foundation,

252
1010
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,031
And...

253
1014
00:31:13,198 --> 00:31:15,371
you.

254
1018
00:31:58,022 --> 00:32:04,505
<i>Now since Grandpa is with Sunbae, I'm really relieved.</i>

255
1022
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:15,398
<i>Sunbae, you don't know that, right?
But Sunbae, you were always like sunshine to me.</i>

256
1027
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:21,259
<i> Goodbye, my fireman.</i>

257
1031
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:41,159
A dandelion lives as a dandelion,

258
1035
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,386
while a horseweed lives as a horseweed.

259
1039
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,288
A plantain also lives as a plantain.

260
1043
00:32:46,288 --> 00:32:52,495
On the harsh grounds, though the plantain that lives on the side of the road can only grow angulated,

261
1047
00:32:52,495 --> 00:32:58,051
In the rich soil, it shows a different side and is dignified in its own way.

262
1051
00:32:58,051 --> 00:33:04,207
This way, and that way, it does not forget its shape and lives as a perfect plantain.

263
1055
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:07,577
That's where I learned it.

264
1059
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:11,613
That I too, must live as myself.

265
1063
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,094
Mister,

266
1067
00:33:26,062 --> 00:33:29,165
I don't think I can come here anymore.

267
1071
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:33,770
I wanted to see you get better.

268
1075
00:33:35,505 --> 00:33:38,241
There were a lot of books I wanted to read to you.

269
1079
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,113
I apologize.

270
1083
00:33:45,248 --> 00:33:47,250
I...

271
1087
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:53,022
can endure hunger.

272
1091
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:57,460
And even being cold, I can endure.

273
1095
00:33:58,094 --> 00:34:01,998
But there is one thing...

274
1099
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:05,969
that I can never endure.

275
1103
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:12,175
It's seeing those that I love endure hardship because of me.

276
1107
00:34:14,243 --> 00:34:20,049
It's not something that I can make better by trying harder.

277
1111
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:26,489
Don't you think it's a little unfair this time?

278
1115
00:34:28,558 --> 00:34:32,162
Mister, I'm not running away.

279
1119
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,198
Mister, you know that, right?

280
1123
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:41,037
Even when I'm not here, you have to get better.


281
1128
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,640
Chairwoman,

282
1132
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,811
Geum Jan Di is here.

283
1136
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:24,714
She came here quicker than I expected.

284
1140
00:35:24,714 --> 00:35:26,115
Let her in.

285
1144
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:02,085
Hello, Miss.

286
1148
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:03,953
Oh, Jandi! 
 Hi!

287
1153
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,688
Has everyone been doing well?

288
1157
00:36:05,688 --> 00:36:08,691
But what's going on?  Is it okay for you to be here?

289
1161
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:12,462
It's OK. They won't kill me or bite me!

290
1165
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:15,098
Geum Jan Di!  Fighting!

291
1169
00:36:15,098 --> 00:36:17,367
We're all on your side!

292
1173
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,706
Hello Sunbae nim.

293
1177
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:29,445
Welcome, Miss Geum Jan Di.

294
1181
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:32,649
Why are you acting like that?

295
1185
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,118
It's me, Geum Jan Di, your apprentice.

296
1189
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:37,987
You're a guest when you come to this house now.

297
1193
00:36:38,755 --> 00:36:41,124
But, what brings you here?

298
1197
00:36:41,758 --> 00:36:44,226
Ah..Goo Joon Pyo....

299
1201
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:45,762
I mean Master Joon Pyo....

300
1205
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,632
I came to see Goo Joon Pyo.

301
1209
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:52,869
Young Master is in his room.

302
1213
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:54,070
Okay...

303
1217
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,746
Joon Pyo, let's play!

304
1221
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:07,484
Goo Joon Pyo, let's play!

305
1225
00:37:07,484 --> 00:37:09,919
Now I'm even hearing Geum Jan Di's voice.

306
1229
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,499
Hey, what's going on?

307
1233
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:25,401
Goo Joon Pyo, let's play.

308
1237
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,309
Why are you here?

309
1241
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,945
Did that Witch do something again?

310
1245
00:37:35,945 --> 00:37:36,764
Is that it?

311
1249
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:39,497
Let's play, Goo Joon Pyo!

312
1253
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:42,031
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?

313
1257
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:46,097
Goo Joon Pyo, let's go on a picnic.

314
1261
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:46,631
What?

315
1265
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:49,631
Picnic!

316
1269
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:25,618
Is today a special day

317
1273
00:39:26,054 --> 00:39:27,316
What?

318
1277
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:35,320
I don't know well but isn't this what it feels like to have a birthday party or to win the lottery?

319
1281
00:39:37,054 --> 00:39:38,683
Are you that happy?

320
1285
00:39:38,683 --> 00:39:39,590
Yes.

321
1289
00:39:40,259 --> 00:39:42,284
I wish every day was like today.

322
1293
00:39:43,638 --> 00:39:47,464
Just think about it. You asked me out on a date.

323
1297
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:49,119
And we haven't even fought once.

324
1301
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:52,558
You're right.

325
1305
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:57,090
While we're on the subject, can I ask you for one more favor?

326
1309
00:39:58,409 --> 00:39:59,359
What is it?

327
1313
00:40:04,214 --> 00:40:07,570
Why haven't you told me that you like me?

328
1317
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:11,710
I've told you many times.

329
1321
00:40:13,504 --> 00:40:16,230
Do I really need to say it in words?

330
1325
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:17,875
I want to hear it.

331
1329
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,167
What kind of person am I to you?

332
1333
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:30,875
I like you.

333
1337
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:36,880
No matter how much I've tried not to like you...

334
1341
00:40:38,412 --> 00:40:43,787
Even though I've tried to erase the feeling, I can't.  It's to the point where I'm just frustrated.

335
1345
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:48,128
Didn't you come because you had something to say?

336
1349
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,459
Leave them alone.

337
1353
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:53,390
What

338
1357
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,425
My friend Ga Eul's family.

339
1361
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,062
Also Ji Hoo Sunbae's Foundation.

340
1365
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:01,831
Just leave them alone.

341
1369
00:42:01,831 --> 00:42:02,967
What's your offer?

342
1373
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:06,096
What are you going to give me in return?

343
1377
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:09,613
If there's nothing as collateral, I don't have any desire to agree.

344
1381
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:12,723
I'll leave.

345
1385
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:19,249
I'll leave Goo Joon Pyo.

346
1389
00:42:21,237 --> 00:42:23,988
I'll transfer schools and move.

347
1393
00:42:25,422 --> 00:42:28,292
I'll move to a place Goo Joon Pyo can never find me.

348
1397
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:29,545
Is that enough?

349
1401
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:35,766
If only you keep that promise..

350
1405
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:37,016
I'll keep that promise.

351
1409
00:42:39,746 --> 00:42:41,305
Fine.

352
1413
00:42:41,305 --> 00:42:42,974
I think we've come to an agreement.

353
1417
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:45,828
I'm not losing to you.

354
1421
00:42:45,828 --> 00:42:47,623
I'm not running away or stealing either.

355
1425
00:42:49,172 --> 00:42:50,481
You are...

356
1429
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:56,253
The most evil person I've ever known.

357
1433
00:43:00,124 --> 00:43:02,393
The people that I love....

358
1437
00:43:03,628 --> 00:43:07,164
I don't want them entangled with you so I'm leaving.

359
1441
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:08,499
From you,

360
1445
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:14,947
the person I love the most

361
1449
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,844
I can't save, and it makes me feel so anxious.

362
1453
00:43:37,328 --> 00:43:38,862
Goo Joon Pyo.

363
1457
00:43:38,862 --> 00:43:39,776
Hmm?

364
1461
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:44,134
Stop the car here.

365
1465
00:43:44,635 --> 00:43:45,970
Here?

366
1469
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:46,964
Why?

367
1473
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,007
Just stop the car.

368
1477
00:44:18,942 --> 00:44:21,137
What's up with these bags?

369
1481
00:44:21,137 --> 00:44:24,183
Is this a surprise event?

370
1485
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:28,460
Goo Joon Pyo,

371
1489
00:44:31,763 --> 00:44:33,953
I'm not going to see you anymore.

372
1493
00:44:34,824 --> 00:44:36,147
What??

373
1497
00:44:36,247 --> 00:44:38,220
Today was my  last day with you.

374
1501
00:44:38,525 --> 00:44:40,105
Hey, Geum Jan Di.

375
1505
00:44:40,105 --> 00:44:42,941
Are you bothered that we didn't fight once today?

376
1509
00:44:43,341 --> 00:44:45,787
Even if you're going to joke around, what kind of a joke is this?

377
1513
00:44:45,787 --> 00:44:47,406
I'm not joking.

378
1517
00:44:49,718 --> 00:44:51,182
What's your reason?

379
1521
00:44:51,821 --> 00:44:53,741
Did the witch do something to you again?

380
1525
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:55,654
No.  It was my decision

381
1529
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:59,958
to take you out of my life.

382
1533
00:45:00,229 --> 00:45:01,552
Geum Jan Di.

383
1537
00:45:01,552 --> 00:45:03,341
Thank you for everything.

384
1541
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:04,796
Take care.

385
1545
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,658
What's wrong with you?

386
1549
00:45:07,442 --> 00:45:09,088
You said you liked me.

387
1553
00:45:10,302 --> 00:45:13,659
Just a while ago you said yourself that you liked me so why are you doing this?

388
1557
00:45:16,268 --> 00:45:17,909
It's because of the witch, isn't it?

389
1561
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:19,610
Right?

390
1565
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:20,912
No.

391
1569
00:45:21,746 --> 00:45:23,481
It's because of me.

392
1573
00:45:23,481 --> 00:45:24,578
What?

393
1577
00:45:24,678 --> 00:45:27,664
This time, I realized

394
1581
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:31,031
that you and I live in two separate worlds.

395
1585
00:45:33,673 --> 00:45:36,464
Even though we met in a dream-like fate, but

396
1589
00:45:36,922 --> 00:45:38,528
now

397
1593
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:41,499
it's time to return to our separate worlds.

398
1597
00:45:42,203 --> 00:45:43,648
That's a lie.

399
1601
00:45:44,815 --> 00:45:47,231
You're lying to me right now.

400
1605
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:50,226
Tell me.

401
1609
00:45:50,226 --> 00:45:52,010
I'll solve it.

402
1613
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,783
I'll protect you!

403
1617
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:10,240
Don't leave!!!

404
1621
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,541
You said you liked me

405
1625
00:46:25,677 --> 00:46:27,377
Your love is like this?

406
1629
00:46:28,013 --> 00:46:31,016
You said that you liked me and you're going to end it so easily?

407
1633
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,687
Maybe it was just this much.

408
1637
00:46:37,944 --> 00:46:40,992
No matter how much I liked you, maybe this is all I could put up with.

409
1641
00:46:42,223 --> 00:46:44,162
Just this much.

410
1645
00:46:44,931 --> 00:46:47,230
Maybe it was just that.

411
1649
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,379
Say it.

412
1653
00:46:49,568 --> 00:46:52,924
Aside from ShinHwa and being a plutocrat,

413
1657
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:55,929
have you ever seen me

414
1661
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,925
as just a guy?

415
1665
00:47:01,689 --> 00:47:03,191
No.

416
1669
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:08,859
No matter how much you struggle, you're still ShinHwa Group's Goo Joon Pyo.

417
1673
00:47:10,048 --> 00:47:14,392
I never forgot that, not even for a single moment.

418
1677
00:47:38,496 --> 00:47:40,293
Pull Over!

419
1681
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:41,311
Jan Di!

420
1685
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,821
Geum Jan Di!

421
1689
00:47:43,788 --> 00:47:45,123
Jan Di!

422
1693
00:47:47,102 --> 00:47:48,960
I said pull over!

423
1697
00:47:49,645 --> 00:47:50,895
Jan Di!

424
1701
00:48:02,728 --> 00:48:05,471
Jan Di !

425
1705
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,949
Ever since I've liked you, I've always wished for it...

426
1709
00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:17,889
that you were a normal guy that had nothing to do with ShinHwa or being a plutocrat.

427
1713
00:48:19,942 --> 00:48:21,489
I'm so sorry Joon Pyo

428
1717
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:26,197
I'm really sorry.

429
1721
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,933
Jan Di!

430
1725
00:49:34,733 --> 00:49:38,303
Grandfather is here.  Where is she?

431
1729
00:49:38,503 --> 00:49:42,256
Jan Di? 
 This child!

432
1734
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,422
<i>I'm sorry that I have to leave this way.</i>

433
1738
00:49:57,422 --> 00:50:00,554
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

434
1742
00:50:00,554 --> 00:50:02,627
<i>I'll never forget how grateful I am.</i>

435
1746
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:05,830
<i>Both of you, please take care.</i>

436
1750
00:51:12,843 --> 00:51:15,987
I'm telling the truth.

437
1754
00:51:15,987 --> 00:51:18,103
Why won't you believe me?

438
1758
00:51:18,103 --> 00:51:20,038
Oh, you're starting again!

439
1762
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:23,527
If your future son-in-law is some heir to great fortune, what are you doing here?

440
1766
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:26,844
And not just any heir, ShinHwa Group?!

441
1770
00:51:26,844 --> 00:51:30,415
Then my future daughter-in-law is Jun Sul Group's daughter!

442
1774
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:33,584
My daughter goes to ShinHwa High School.

443
1778
00:51:33,584 --> 00:51:36,988
I've even made dinner for ShinHwa Group's heir, Goo Joon Pyo.

444
1782
00:51:36,988 --> 00:51:39,801
Why won't you believe a word I say?

445
1786
00:51:39,801 --> 00:51:40,558
Fine, all right.

446
1790
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:46,364
Then why don't you go to your future son-in-law and have him take care of your debts?

447
1794
00:51:46,364 --> 00:51:49,963
If you don't, something might happen to you

448
1798
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:55,984
Oh, welcome. What can I get you

449
1802
00:51:55,984 --> 00:51:57,775
Give me one of these

450
1806
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:04,882
Here you go.

451
1810
00:52:14,436 --> 00:52:15,960
Who is that?

452
1814
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,964
He came here in kind of the same situation as you.

453
1818
00:52:18,964 --> 00:52:21,766
He was the president of a startup company...

454
1822
00:52:21,766 --> 00:52:24,036
M, M . . .

455
1826
00:52:24,036 --> 00:52:29,407
However, he lost everything because of some large corporations.

456
1830
00:52:30,408 --> 00:52:35,146
He was divorced and lost his kids, too.

457
1834
00:52:35,146 --> 00:52:36,381
Oh, no.  What to do?

458
1838
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:43,588
Seeing that he's been hanging around here for the past few months, I think he's hiding from creditors.

459
1842
00:52:43,588 --> 00:52:44,790
That's really too bad.

460
1846
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:49,460
You've got problems of your own.  You're in no position to worry about others!

461
1850
00:52:50,193 --> 00:52:51,596
Yes, that's right.

462
1854
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:30,935
Isn't that Jan Di?

463
1858
00:53:33,771 --> 00:53:35,706
Oh, my.  Oh, my!  Jan Di!

464
1862
00:53:35,706 --> 00:53:37,341
Mom!

465
1866
00:53:41,379 --> 00:53:44,682
What brought you here? 
 I wanted to see you.

466
1871
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:46,518
Is this the daughter that you've been talking about?

467
1875
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:48,853
Yes, yes. This is her!

468
1879
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:51,623
Watch this.  See this?

469
1883
00:53:51,623 --> 00:53:55,194
See?  This is ShinHwa High School uniform!

470
1887
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:58,396
Oh, my, you said she went to ShinHwa High.  She really does go there!

471
1891
00:53:59,663 --> 00:54:02,067
Jan Di, come on.  Let's go talk!

472
1895
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:04,736
Why don't you all watch over my little store?

473
1899
00:54:04,736 --> 00:54:07,839
Okay, okay, don't worry.

474
1903
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,642
Oh, what kind of luck is that!

475
1907
00:54:11,343 --> 00:54:13,511
Watch it carefully!

476
1911
00:54:13,511 --> 00:54:15,913
How and what brought you here, Jan Di?

477
1915
00:54:17,148 --> 00:54:19,083
She looks like she's grown well.

478
1919
00:54:19,984 --> 00:54:21,085
What?

479
1923
00:54:21,085 --> 00:54:23,254
Dad's on a boat?

480
1927
00:54:23,254 --> 00:54:24,856
What were we supposed to do?

481
1931
00:54:24,856 --> 00:54:27,625
Our debt kept growing.

482
1935
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:29,461
We have to send your brother Kang San, to school.

483
1939
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:31,663
It seems like we can't even support the three of us.

484
1943
00:54:31,663 --> 00:54:33,265
Why didn't you tell me then?

485
1947
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:35,466
What good would it have done except to make you worry?

486
1951
00:54:35,466 --> 00:54:38,804
I could have quit school, gotten a job.  I could have done something.

487
1955
00:54:38,804 --> 00:54:41,372
And that's why I didn't say anything

488
1959
00:54:41,372 --> 00:54:44,642
You need to graduate from ShinHwa High and go to ShinHwa University.

489
1963
00:54:44,642 --> 00:54:50,048
Get married to Master Joon Pyo or someone so we can survive.

490
1967
00:54:50,048 --> 00:54:52,183
That's our hope.

491
1971
00:54:52,183 --> 00:54:53,618
Mom...

492
1975
00:54:53,618 --> 00:54:56,421
That's rubbish.

493
1979
00:54:56,421 --> 00:55:00,892
Wait, you....why aren't you going to school and why'd you suddenly come here?

494
1983
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,371
I came because I missed you guys.

495
1987
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:06,496
Mom, dad, San.

496
1991
00:55:11,772 --> 00:55:15,926
Honey! Our daughter, Jan Di, came.

497
1995
00:55:17,676 --> 00:55:20,177
You're doing well right?

498
1999
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:27,550
Daddy!

499
2003
00:55:28,587 --> 00:55:32,122
I came. You're healthy, right?

500
2007
00:55:33,036 --> 00:55:35,962
Please look after your health!

501
2011
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:38,996
Dad!

502
2015
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,179
Dad!

503
2019
00:55:53,945 --> 00:55:56,703
Have you heard any news about Jan Di?

504
2023
00:55:57,147 --> 00:55:58,822
Well....

505
2027
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:02,219
I've searched just about everywhere.  It's harder to find her than I thought.

506
2031
00:56:02,998 --> 00:56:04,862
I wonder where she's hidden herself so well.

507
2035
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:08,324
That Joon Pyo, I don't think he's ever been so unreachable.

508
2039
00:56:09,255 --> 00:56:10,835
He wasn't even this bad in Macao.

509
2043
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:12,324
I know...

510
2047
00:56:12,324 --> 00:56:16,416
It's as if he's sitting on a time bomb.  It's hard to watch from above or below.

511
2051
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:18,536
The weird thing is, Ji Hoo is the same way.

512
2055
00:56:18,536 --> 00:56:20,605
He's doing well with his grandfather.

513
2059
00:56:20,605 --> 00:56:24,758
Do you think Yoon Ji Hoo going to work every day at the Foundation is normal?

514
2063
00:56:26,544 --> 00:56:29,747
For a guy who used to sleep all the time and mess around with his instruments to act like that is....

515
2067
00:56:29,747 --> 00:56:32,238
I think is more strange than how Joon Pyo is acting, and it makes me quite worried.

516
2071
00:56:32,238 --> 00:56:33,414
That is true.

517
2075
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:35,669
How impressive Geum Jan Di is!

518
2079
00:56:35,669 --> 00:56:38,864
To put the great F4 into this state and then disappear.

519
2083
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:08,586
Yes, Grandfather.  It's me.

520
2087
00:57:10,455 --> 00:57:11,287
Yes.

521
2091
00:57:11,287 --> 00:57:12,824
I'll come get you right now

522
2095
00:57:55,065 --> 00:57:59,203
Oh, what should I do!  Our Jan Di has come to visit and the banchan (side dishes) are lacking.

523
2099
00:57:59,661 --> 00:58:00,671
What about the ban chan?

524
2103
00:58:01,385 --> 00:58:04,909
Just the fact that I'm having a meal with you makes me so happy I can die!

525
2107
00:58:06,078 --> 00:58:09,431
Noona, how many days will you be staying before you leave?  It'll be nice if you could stay a long time.

526
2111
00:58:10,215 --> 00:58:11,925
I'll be staying a long time.

527
2115
00:58:11,925 --> 00:58:15,085
What do you mean you'll be staying a long time?  You have to go to school.

528
2119
00:58:15,085 --> 00:58:17,721
Stop worrying about your family and accomplish what you need to do.

529
2123
00:58:18,956 --> 00:58:20,591
Kang San's mom...

530
2127
00:58:20,591 --> 00:58:21,759
I wonder who it is.

531
2131
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:29,434
We came.

532
2135
00:58:29,434 --> 00:58:31,068
What are you guys doing here?

533
2139
00:58:31,068 --> 00:58:36,841
Oh, she is definitely future daughter-in-law material for a filthy rich family.

534
2143
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:43,129
Only the rich attend ShinHwa High, so you must have lots of friends who are rich!

535
2147
00:58:43,129 --> 00:58:47,785
Who cares about the friends?  She's dating the heir to ShinHwa Group!

536
2151
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:55,025
Living in the country, I never dreamed that I'd come to know the in-laws of ShinHwa Group!

537
2155
00:58:55,025 --> 00:58:57,294
Oh, I know, I know.

538
2159
00:58:57,294 --> 00:58:59,330
Try this

539
2163
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:03,234
Oh, and the money that you borrowed, just take your time in paying that back.

540
2167
00:59:03,234 --> 00:59:04,654
Oh, really?

541
2171
00:59:04,654 --> 00:59:05,569
Oh, yes.  Of course.

542
2175
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:08,729
Oh, and take this.

543
2179
00:59:08,729 --> 00:59:11,075
Take this too.

544
2183
00:59:11,075 --> 00:59:12,843
Take it. Take it.

545
2187
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:22,019
What's the occasion,  this late at night?

546
2191
00:59:24,376 --> 00:59:27,511
Eat it. 
Okay, we'll eat it well.

547
2196
01:00:19,712 --> 01:00:21,846
You got it! I got it!

548
2200
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:46,296
<i>You said you liked me.</i>

549
2204
01:00:46,902 --> 01:00:48,438
<i>Is this how your love is?</i>

550
2208
01:00:49,327 --> 01:00:52,122
<i>Can you really say you like me and end it this easily?</i>

551
2212
01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:56,614
<i>This must have been the limit.</i>

552
2216
01:00:59,027 --> 01:01:00,638
<i>No matter how much I liked you,</i>

553
2220
01:01:02,636 --> 01:01:04,295
<i>The amount I could put up with</i>

554
2224
01:01:07,257 --> 01:01:11,462
<i>Must've been only this much.</i>

555
2228
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:23,012
Hey, what are you doing?

556
2232
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,675
Master, why are you doing this?

557
2236
01:01:24,675 --> 01:01:26,577
Why are you breaking somebody else's machine?

558
2240
01:01:26,577 --> 01:01:27,596
Don't touch me!

559
2244
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:54,189
<i>Why haven't you told me that you like me?</i>

560
2248
01:01:54,189 --> 01:01:57,074
<i>Do I really have to say it in words?</i>

561
2252
01:01:57,489 --> 01:01:58,642
<i>I want to hear it.</i>

562
2256
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,048
<i>What I am to you...</i>

563
2260
01:02:09,253 --> 01:02:10,724
<i>I like you.</i>

564
2264
01:02:13,274 --> 01:02:16,288
<i>No matter how much I've tried to not like you,</i>

565
2268
01:02:18,429 --> 01:02:21,033
<i>even though I've tried to erase the feeling,</i>

566
2272
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:23,167
<i>I can't, to the point where I'm just frustrated.</i>

567
2276
01:02:41,652 --> 01:02:43,038
Joon Pyo.
