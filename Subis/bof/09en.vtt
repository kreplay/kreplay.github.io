1
3
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,439
It's too loud! Be quiet!

2
7
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,017
It's really delicious!

3
11
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:03,049
We are . . . 
Don't eat!

4
16
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:04,818
Just put it on anywhere.

5
20
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:05,333
Hey, be quiet!

6
24
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,956
Butler Lee, it's so noisy.

7
28
00:01:08,956 --> 00:01:10,256
It's almost time for him to wake up.

8
32
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:12,091
Should we seat him at the head of the table?  Or . . .

9
36
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:13,367
No, the middle of the table there, there ...

10
40
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:14,762
Butler Lee!

11
44
00:01:14,762 --> 00:01:17,695
You sit here.  Got it?  And . . .

12
48
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:19,299
Put the Jjim on my side!

13
52
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:22,400
KangSan, please stop fidgeting!

14
56
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,860
My favorite . . . 
Honey, please stop!

15
61
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,443
So noisy. Please be quiet.

16
65
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,985
Did you sleep well?

17
69
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:58,137
It isn't much, but please eat up, Goo Seo Bang.
(SeoBang = hubby / daughter's husband).

18
74
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:08,281
Eat it while it's warm.

19
78
00:02:13,518 --> 00:02:16,290
Honey, this jjim.

20
82
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,496
Right, right, right.
This jjim was done really well since I cooked it for a long time.

21
87
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:25,798
It's really good. Just try.

22
91
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:33,873
Are you alright, Goo Seo Bang?

23
95
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:42,214
Big brother, are you going to keep living in our house?

24
99
00:02:42,214 --> 00:02:43,216
Hey!

25
103
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:50,289
We don't get to eat pancakes even on national holidays.
This is the first time we've had a breakfast like this before!

26
108
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:23,924
Did Joon Pyo go somewhere?

27
112
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:30,362
He is still sleeping.

28
116
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:32,865
Tell him to come down. 
Just let him be.

29
121
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,437
He was up late last night with the F4 young masters.

30
125
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:43,476
At his age, he still hangs around with those kids. . .

31
129
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:45,777
What about those kids?

32
133
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:49,916
Don't you know how glad I am that Joon Pyo has such friends?

33
137
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:54,587
The heir of Shin Hwa can't have any and he doesn't need friends.

34
141
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:55,521
Mom.

35
145
00:03:55,521 --> 00:04:03,501
In his position, he can't afford to let anyone be on par with him.
He has to be cold hearted. 

That way, if needed, he can always fall back on the family.

Don't you understand anything?

36
154
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:08,967
I would rather die than acknowledge that way of thinking.

37
158
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:14,073
Do you know how many times we have breakfast together each year?

38
162
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:16,843
And whos fault is that?

39
166
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:20,481
Bring him.

40
170
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,855
Forget about it. I'll go myself.

41
174
00:04:56,682 --> 00:04:59,785
Goo Joon Pyo, Mother is coming in!

42
178
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:19,438
Where did that child go?

43
182
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:26,345
I am asking you why Joon Pyo isn't here!

44
186
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:29,782
Making kimjang?
 (kimjang=BIG amount of kimchi made to store during winter)

45
191
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,819
Your family of 4 is going to eat all this?

46
195
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:38,558
You don't eat only kimchi everyday. . .
No, hyung. We do. We only eat kimchi.

47
200
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:42,995
Because of the high prices,
we are making less than the past.

48
205
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:44,595
Ready! ready!

49
209
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,765
Get set!

50
213
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:49,367
Get set! Go! Jan Di!

51
217
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:49,902
Kang San!

52
221
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:52,505
Jan Di!

53
225
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:53,506
Gang San!

54
229
00:05:58,044 --> 00:05:59,412
Great!

55
233
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:02,048
Pass it!

56
237
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:03,849
Hey, is it fun?

57
241
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:27,106
I brought them.
Honey, bring the aekjeot.
(Aekjeot = the water salted with a sand eel/anchovy).

58
247
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:34,547
Honey, is this the aekjeot?
Yes.

59
252
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:37,116
Let me mix them for you.

60
256
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:46,359
Nooo, that's not how you do it.   You have to spread it out like this.

61
260
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:48,527
You have to learn how to make this before getting married.

62
264
00:06:59,972 --> 00:07:01,807
How about it?
It's good.

63
269
00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:01,327
Honey!  We are here.
Shh!  Be quiet, please.

64
274
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,833
Honey, Goo seobang's skin is delicate.
You have to scrub it gently.

65
279
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:14,673
Don't worry.
- Goo seobang! I will prepare some refreshing coffee and milk for you.

66
284
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:16,108
Let's go.

67
288
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:19,712
Get clean!

68
292
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:47,306
One, two, three!

69
296
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:17,129
Ah fishcakes! Ma'am. Six pieces, please.
Two per person.

70
301
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:39,675
It's delicious. 
Of course it's delicious!

71
306
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:48,484
Can I have some more? 
Of course! How many? Just eat them all!

72
311
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:51,120
Eat them as much as you want.

73
315
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:09,365
What's wrong with him this time?

74
319
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:12,434
Did he eat something weird at Geum Jan Di's house?

75
323
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:17,272
Joon Pyo, did you really go to Jan Di's home yesterday?

76
327
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:20,351
You guys.
Have you ever made kimjang?

77
332
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:23,564
What?
What's that?

78
337
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:30,585
You haven't?
 Then, have you ever gotten scrubbed down at a public bathhouses?

79
342
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:32,921
Huh? What's he talking about?

80
346
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:35,633
You haven't eaten a fishcake at a cart bar, right?

81
350
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:49,201
Do you guys even know what it's like to really live life?

82
354
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:59,914
I liked him better when he was messing up proverbs.

I'm more scared of Geum Jan Di than small pox.

83
360
00:14:34,147 --> 00:14:35,985
Sunbae! (=senior)

84
364
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:51,999
There seems to be a lot of things bothering you lately.

85
368
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:54,152
Is it because of Joon Pyo?

86
372
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:05,481
You're going to catch a cold.

87
376
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:17,493
I'm fine. Thank you.

88
380
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:20,728
This is really warm!

89
384
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:22,231
Can I give you some advice?

90
388
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:25,300
Yes?
Don't avoid him.

91
393
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:27,837
Senior.

92
397
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:32,207
Who was the one who said it was cowardly to avoid things?

93
401
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:35,578
Senior . . .

94
405
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:38,681
Don't avoid him.  Give him a chance.

95
409
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:53,560
Honestly, it feels like a burden being dragged around in Joon Pyo's world.

96
413
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,767
There's no such thing as Joon Pyo's world or Jan Di's world.

97
417
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:09,942
Just like you and I are of the same world,

98
421
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:18,219
If it is a burden, you can drag him into your world.
Isn't that your speciality?

99
426
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:31,266
I'll take your advice. Thank you, Sunbae!
See you again.

100
431
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:11,373
Stop pacing around like that. Just call her.

101
435
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:17,445
Stop and think about it.
If you call her first you become a slave.

102
440
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:23,852
I won't call.
I won't move a finger until she calls me first.

103
445
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:31,092
That's right! You are doing well.
That is a basic principle right out the playboy's rule book.
It's called "Pushing and Pulling".

104
451
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:37,966
How can you say that as you're watching him do that?

Withdrawal symptoms of Geum Jan Di . .
It should be a mental disease.

105
458
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,303
It's her. It's her.

106
462
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,907
Cool it. Relax.

107
466
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,983
Hello?

108
470
00:17:57,085 --> 00:17:58,754
Geum Jan Di?

109
474
00:18:00,522 --> 00:18:02,824
Who is 'Geum Jan Di'?

110
478
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:07,329
That is a little overboard.
A little?! It's too much.

111
483
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:14,035
Oh! That's right, I remember now. What's up?

112
487
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:16,738
Am I free right now?

113
491
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:21,110
I am so busy that I didn't even remember that
 you haven't called me in three days and thirteen hours.

114
496
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,279
Hey man, whoa, whoa.

115
500
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:36,023
- I'm embarrassed to call him my friend.
-What?
What do you take me for?
Why would I go there with a stranger??

116
507
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:38,160
I'm not going! I'm hanging up.

117
511
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,167
Did you see?

118
515
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,337
Did you hear me raise my voice? Huh?

119
519
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,707
It was me who hung up the phone.

120
523
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:57,079
Why did you get angry?
She said we should have a double date thing.

121
528
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,682
Double date? With whom?

122
532
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,918
Could it be, Miss Ga Eul?

123
536
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,855
That girl, she's pretty interesting.

124
540
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:07,990
Joon Pyo, aren't you going?

125
544
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:15,729
Dates are for two people. 
 And, what the hell, how lame...
 it's in front of a burger place.

126
550
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:18,699
Then I'll go in your place.

127
554
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,036
What? Why would you go?

128
558
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:23,972
I want to know what commoners do on dates.
It could be interesting, I think.

129
563
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:28,609
Shut it! 
Meet at the shooting range by ten tomorrow!

130
568
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:30,212
Got it?

131
572
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,756
He won't come, he didn't like the idea.

132
576
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:43,058
Then why are you waiting?

133
580
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:50,899
Who was waiting?
I was just waiting to meet your new boyfriend.

134
585
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:58,606
Who's that?

135
589
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:02,109
Could it be Geum Jan Di?

136
593
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,845
Goo Joon Pyo?

137
597
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,520
What a coincidence!
Coincidence?

138
602
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:23,798
It was just that I was passing by
and a country bumpkin like you
 was standing there .shivering.

139
608
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:25,801
I came over just in case...

140
612
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:30,305
Really? Then just go on with your business.

141
616
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:33,208
I was just waiting for Ga Eul's boyfriend.

142
620
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,277
Why are you waiting for someone else's boyfriend?

143
624
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,913
Just leave.

144
628
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:39,648
Don't test me!

145
632
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,087
I'm done with my business. Do you want me to stay with you?

146
636
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:48,924
Huh?

147
640
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:53,028
Do you think it would be alright to stick to them like a booger while they're on a date?

148
644
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:56,230
Booger?

149
648
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,800
Fine, I'll be nice.
I'll stay with you.

150
653
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,736
This is great, Jan Di!

151
657
00:21:01,736 --> 00:21:05,640
I have a bad feeling about this.

152
661
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,444
But why isn't he here yet? He's already 30 minutes late.

153
665
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:11,546
What manners!

154
669
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:14,116
Sorry, I'll try calling him.

155
673
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:16,952
Hurry up.

156
677
00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:28,296
I lost money and got stood up.
 That Goo Joon Pyo is seriously no help.

157
682
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:35,170
It's cold. If I knew it was going to be like this,
I would have just played a game of squash.

158
687
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:39,141
How did you know that Goo Joon Pyo
wasn't going to come?

159
692
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:43,812
I'll treat you with the money I won on the bet.

160
696
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,284
Hey!

161
700
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,289
Why are you so late?

162
704
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:57,759
Hi!  It's nice to meet you.  I'm Hoo Soon Pyo!

163
708
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,997
Hello! I'm Geum Jan Di, a friend of Ga Eul's.

164
712
00:22:01,997 --> 00:22:07,069
And, this is, Goo Joon Pyo.
(My . . .)

165
717
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:13,975
Whoa! Your hairstyle rocks.
Where did you have it done?
It looks like a sea shell.

166
723
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:24,632
If I put this on my blog, it'll be a huge hit!

167
727
00:22:24,632 --> 00:22:27,201
- What?
- Oppa!

168
732
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:35,710
Now that I think about it, Soon Pyo and Joon Pyo, just like brothers. 
 Call me hyung (older brother).  Let's get along.

169
737
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:46,653
Who the hell does he think he is?

170
741
00:22:46,653 --> 00:22:52,192
He didn't even apologize when he was the one who was late. 
 What? 
 Sea shell? . . f!@&!(a croissant is called "sea shell bread" in korean))

171
747
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:57,998
Goo Joon Pyo, I'm sorry.

172
751
00:22:57,998 --> 00:23:02,804
Should we just leave? We can just leave. Let's do that.

173
755
00:23:05,571 --> 00:23:11,279
No, let's go on a commoner's date just this once.

174
759
00:23:50,551 --> 00:23:52,486
You want it? 
 Thank you. 
 We don't need this.

175
765
00:24:22,283 --> 00:24:23,584
Look at this!

176
769
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:41,369
What the hell is this place?

177
773
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:45,072
Dongsaeng, is this your first time?
 (Dongsaeng = Younger sibling)

178
778
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:47,008
Have you never eaten small intestines?

179
782
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:50,811
Small intestines? 
The inner parts of cows and pigs.

180
787
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:52,446
Inner?

181
791
00:24:52,446 --> 00:24:55,383
You don't know the small intestines and the large intestines?

182
795
00:24:57,585 --> 00:25:01,888
What the hell, younger brother, 
 are you choking?

183
800
00:25:01,888 --> 00:25:07,628
Jan Di, maybe you should rethink your choice. 
 How can you trust your life with a guy
 that can't eat small intestines?

184
806
00:25:09,497 --> 00:25:12,099
What did you say?

185
810
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:14,869
Ah, it looks delicious!

186
814
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:16,504
I'm going to eat as much as I can!

187
818
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:21,209
Please try some. Chew slowly. It's savory and quite good.

188
822
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:25,546
Hey, just look at him.  He doesn't seem like he can eat it.

189
826
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:30,317
Don't overdo it,  just give up. 
 Since there is not enough for us . . .

190
831
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:33,287
Who says i can't eat it?

191
835
00:25:52,172 --> 00:25:54,408
Are you okay?
Of course I'm okay!

192
840
00:25:54,408 --> 00:25:57,810
Are you really okay?

193
844
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,480
I don't think so!

194
848
00:26:02,983 --> 00:26:07,487
I'm warning you, be careful.

195
852
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:10,391
I'm being nice and you don't even realize it. Idiots rush in where tigers fear to tread..

196
856
00:26:10,391 --> 00:26:17,398
What? Younger brother, by any chance did you mean to say fools rush in where angels fear to tread?

197
860
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,968
Dongsaeng, you're really funny!

198
864
00:26:20,968 --> 00:26:28,074
Hey!   Don't you guys go to Shin Hwa High? 
That really is a school that you just pay money to attend!
 How much do you have to pay?

199
870
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:31,879
Goo Joon Pyo.

200
874
00:27:43,217 --> 00:27:45,952
It's beautiful!

201
878
00:27:45,952 --> 00:27:47,455
You like it that much?

202
882
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:50,091
It's my first time coming somewhere like this.

203
886
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:52,827
This place is like a fairytale.

204
890
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,899
What are you, a little match girl?

205
894
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:02,303
Why are you going around without your gloves?
I do have gloves!

206
899
00:28:09,943 --> 00:28:12,378
Come here.

207
903
00:28:27,962 --> 00:28:30,064
Let's go together next time.

208
907
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:32,399
Where? 
To the Champs Elyses.

209
912
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:51,986
Younger brother, why don't we go buy warm cups of coffee for the ladies?

210
916
00:28:53,787 --> 00:28:55,256
It's okay , I'm fine.

211
920
00:28:56,724 --> 00:28:59,351
Let's go, huh?

212
924
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:25,485
Oh, okay! Me?

213
928
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:27,087
I'm at the skating rink.

214
932
00:29:34,195 --> 00:29:36,196
I'm sorry.

215
936
00:29:36,196 --> 00:29:38,665
About Soon Pyo oppa.

216
940
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:42,702
It's fine. 
 He doesn't seem like a bad person.

217
945
00:29:42,702 --> 00:29:47,941
It may have been a bit uneasy, but I think we've achieved our objective, right?

218
949
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:54,849
Objective? 
Look at how hard Joon Pyo sunbae
 tries to meet you at your level. 
 I'm honestly impressed.

219
956
00:29:56,984 --> 00:30:00,320
He does seem like he's trying in his own little way.

220
960
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,390
Yeah, I think you can trust him now.

221
964
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,795
But why are they taking so long? 
 Should we go see?

222
969
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:19,206
Goo Joon Pyo!    Oppa!

223
973
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:22,643
What are you doing?

224
977
00:30:25,912 --> 00:30:28,582
Why did you hit him? What's wrong with you?

225
981
00:30:28,582 --> 00:30:30,317
Do I need a reason to beat this bastard?

226
985
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:38,592
Hey! 
You.  If you're going to date a guy,
 at least pick a good one.

227
991
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:43,097
You'd better stop right there!

228
995
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:49,904
Apologize!

229
999
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:56,709
If you leave like that, it's over with me.

230
1003
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:59,447
Jan Di!

Apologize!

231
1009
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,220
Hey! Goo Joon Pyo! Hey!

232
1013
00:31:12,226 --> 00:31:15,295
How did this happen? 
I don't know.

233
1018
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:19,299
i wanted to become friends with him, but he started hitting me for no reason.

234
1022
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:22,570
He could have just said it if he didn't like me.

235
1026
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:25,638
Ouch! My teeth are aching.

236
1030
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:27,774
It's going to take 8 weeks to fully recover from this.

237
1034
00:31:27,774 --> 00:31:29,810
I'm sorry.

238
1038
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,512
I'll apologize on his behalf.

239
1042
00:31:45,943 --> 00:31:49,363
Ah, this one here. 
 Ah, that one there.

240
1047
00:32:23,997 --> 00:32:27,168
He won't pick up or answer my texts.

241
1051
00:32:29,637 --> 00:32:31,939
I'm sorry, Ga Eul.

242
1055
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:37,911
I really have nothing to say . . .

243
1059
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:39,414
right now do I.

244
1063
00:32:39,414 --> 00:32:45,051
No, don't say anything.  Joon Pyo wouldn't have done something like that without a reason.

245
1067
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:46,220
What are you saying?

246
1071
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,959
That day, Oppa kept making mistakes, and Joon Pyo sunbae was being patient.

247
1075
00:32:53,461 --> 00:32:55,697
There must be a reason.

248
1079
00:32:55,697 --> 00:33:01,290
Reason?  What reason?  Have his actions ever made any sense before?

249
1083
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:08,790
Every time, he does as he likes.
That bastard still has a lot to learn.

250
1088
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,732
Just wait and see.

251
1092
00:33:09,732 --> 00:33:10,867
What are you going to do?

252
1096
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:16,039
On Geum Jan Di's honor,  I will get an apology.

253
1100
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,882
Geum Jan Di, what's up?

254
1104
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:31,453
I came because I have something to tell Goo Joon Pyo, so please pass on this message.

255
1108
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:32,822
He's right next to you.

256
1112
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,762
She said she wants to talk to you.

257
1116
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:44,800
I have nothing to say, so tell her to do whatever she wants.

258
1120
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,236
He said to pass it on.

259
1124
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:51,574
Ask him what country's courtesy is hitting someone without a reason and not apologizing?

260
1128
00:33:51,574 --> 00:33:54,343
Hey, you got into trouble again?

261
1132
00:33:54,343 --> 00:33:56,779
She asked what country's courtesy is that.

262
1136
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:00,082
Pass it on that my fist is a waste for that bastard.

263
1140
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:04,939
He said it was a waste.  How long do I have to do this for?

264
1144
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:07,290
Hey, what's wrong with you guys?

265
1148
00:34:09,526 --> 00:34:14,130
Please tell him to listen good because this is my last warning.

266
1152
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:18,668
Because of what he did, my friend is really upset.

267
1156
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:21,938
If he doesn't apologize, it's really the end between us.

268
1160
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:27,810
A "thank you" wouldn't even be enough 
for getting rid of trash like that.

269
1165
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,715
Tell her I won't do it, even if I die. She can do whatever she wants.

270
1169
00:34:31,715 --> 00:34:36,186
Joon Pyo!
- I got it, Goo Joon Pyo.

271
1174
00:34:36,186 --> 00:34:39,989
Hey, of course this is just like you.

272
1178
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:44,727
From the beginning it was impossible for you to force yourself
to match someone else's level and get along with others.

273
1183
00:34:44,727 --> 00:34:49,899
But, what I don't understand is why Ga Eul, 
who is at no fault, has to be punished for that.

274
1188
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:58,974
Goo JoonPyo I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore.

275
1192
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:03,178
Geum Jan Di!
Hey, what's wrong with you guys, really?

276
1197
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:06,649
Please excuse me. Good bye.

277
1201
00:35:10,419 --> 00:35:13,456
Hey, aren't you going after her? Are you just going to let her go?

278
1205
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:15,992
What did you do this time?

279
1209
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:39,682
See, I told you, you'd catch a cold.

280
1213
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:01,236
How did you know I was here?

281
1217
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:05,875
You swim when you're frustrated. You're frustrated over something now,

282
1221
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:09,245
So you're here at the swimming pool.

283
1225
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:10,300
Is it that difficult?

284
1229
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,915
If it's about Goo Joon Pyo, I'm not going to talk about it.

285
1233
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:14,684
When did I say it was about Joon Pyo?

286
1237
00:36:14,684 --> 00:36:20,722
If he did something wrong to me, I would just be angry with him; but this is about Ga Eul so I can't.

287
1241
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:23,259
They were only trying to help us.

288
1245
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:26,529
You're talking about Joon Pyo now, right?

289
1249
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:30,066
Am I allowed to answer?

290
1253
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:34,070
Anyway, I will never forgive him this time.

291
1257
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:41,377
If Ga Eul breaks up with her boyfriend because of this, how will I be able to face Goo Joon Pyo again?

292
1261
00:36:41,377 --> 00:36:43,580
You said you're not going to talk about him, but you are.

293
1265
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:49,886
I was hoping you wouldn't need this. This won't do.

294
1269
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,160
"Medicine"

295
1273
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,531
If you don't dry your hair after you swim, you'll catch a cold.

296
1277
00:37:02,531 --> 00:37:07,436
Some how, someone's doing that every day.

297
1281
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:08,972
So . . .

298
1285
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,942
See?
Senior . . .

299
1290
00:37:12,942 --> 00:37:15,378
You're thankful, right?

300
1294
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:18,046
Then I'll say one more thing.

301
1298
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:26,055
When a guy is with a girl he likes, there's no such thing as "just because."

302
1302
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:31,427
There will always be a reason.

303
1306
00:37:31,427 --> 00:37:32,495
Huh?

304
1310
00:37:34,397 --> 00:37:37,600
I’m speaking from experience, so you can trust me.

305
1314
00:37:40,436 --> 00:37:41,971
I'm leaving!

306
1318
00:38:04,843 --> 00:38:07,496
Come on.

307
1322
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:10,032
Jan Di, I'm scared!

308
1326
00:38:10,032 --> 00:38:14,036
Are you just going to wait around for someone who hasn't contacted you in days?

309
1330
00:38:14,036 --> 00:38:16,405
Hurry up.

310
1334
00:38:16,405 --> 00:38:20,577
You said that Gong Soon Pyo works at a club near here, right?

311
1338
00:38:25,615 --> 00:38:28,151
Oppa . . .

312
1342
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:36,558
You know the high schooler I've been dating out of boredom?

313
1346
00:38:36,558 --> 00:38:40,330
I went on a double date with her, and the guy
that came out was a total plutocrat.

314
1351
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,865
Plutocrat? You should introduce me to him!~

315
1355
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:49,638
Give it up.
 That fool seemed like he had a ton of money, 
but really bad taste.

316
1361
00:38:49,638 --> 00:38:54,777
That high schooler had an elementary kid's body.

Do you know how poor they look?

317
1367
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:58,615
They're both mush.
Mush? From which club?

318
1372
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:01,452
No, they work at a porridge shop.

319
1376
00:39:01,452 --> 00:39:05,454
What? But her boyfriend is a plutocrat?
-Right.

320
1381
00:39:05,454 --> 00:39:11,728
She's that pretty?
Pretty?!  I told him I would introduce him to a fine girl like you,

321
1386
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:14,530
and he starts throwing punches for no reason!

322
1390
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:25,275
Yeah, ok. Me??

323
1394
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:28,210
I'm at the skating rink.

324
1398
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:33,182
What do you mean why? I'm playing with some kids. Oppa's working hard.

325
1402
00:39:35,618 --> 00:39:38,754
What? Really?

326
1406
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:41,324
I got it! Wait for me!

327
1410
00:39:48,362 --> 00:39:52,934
Joon Pyo dongsaeng, why don't we talk as men?

328
1414
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:57,439
That Jan Di(grass) or Japcho(weeds), isn't she nothing?

329
1418
00:39:57,439 --> 00:40:00,109
Does she have something on you?

330
1422
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:01,377
What did you say?

331
1426
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:07,349
Does she have money?  You could do better.

332
1430
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:10,051
What're you trying to say?

333
1434
00:40:10,051 --> 00:40:17,826
Don't you want to just get this over with, and go to a club with me? If we go, there are girls that you can't even compare to the ones over there (Jan Di and Ga Eul).

334
1438
00:40:19,527 --> 00:40:20,330
What's wrong with you?

335
1442
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:33,776
If you keep on talking s$% about my girlfriend, I'm not gonna let you eat with that mouth anymore!

336
1446
00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:35,378
understand?!

337
1450
00:40:42,451 --> 00:40:45,355
Was what you just said true? Hoo Soon Pyo?

338
1454
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:49,258
- You guys . . . 
 - I'm asking you if it's true.

339
1459
00:40:49,258 --> 00:40:51,343
What're you going to do if it's true?

340
1463
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:53,129
Oppa, who are they?

341
1467
00:40:53,129 --> 00:40:55,064
Do you know them?

342
1471
00:40:55,064 --> 00:40:57,900
Does it look like I would know them?

343
1475
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,473
Oppa. 
 What's your reason for not calling Ga Eul?

344
1480
00:41:03,473 --> 00:41:15,448
My reason?  Fine.  Do you always have to be told harshly to know if something is sh*t or korean bean paste?

345
1484
00:41:15,448 --> 00:41:22,825
Hey you, ugly girl!  Why don't you try to send less texts?  Are you a stalker?
  My inbox is full.  It's a complete nuisance!

346
1489
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:45,480
You!

347
1493
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,186
One is for my friend Ga Eul and the other is for my boyfriend.

348
1497
00:41:51,186 --> 00:41:54,592
If you ever appear in front of Ga Eul, I'm going to kill you!

349
1501
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:55,561
Understood?

350
1505
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,796
Who are you? Go home!

351
1509
00:42:07,335 --> 00:42:10,272
What kind of guy is that?

352
1513
00:42:10,272 --> 00:42:14,443
Even so, I'm glad.

353
1517
00:42:14,443 --> 00:42:15,678
What?

354
1521
00:42:15,678 --> 00:42:20,216
Joon Pyo Sunbae isn't a bad guy after all.

355
1525
00:42:22,218 --> 00:42:24,086
Ga Eul . . .

356
1529
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:28,123
I'm fine, really!

357
1533
00:42:28,123 --> 00:42:31,293
Jan Di, hurry up and go.

358
1537
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:32,395
Where?

359
1541
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:34,764
You should apologize to Joon Pyo Sunbae.

360
1545
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:39,201
That . . .

361
1549
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:41,736
Hurry up and tell him you're sorry.

362
1553
00:42:41,736 --> 00:42:45,206
Then I'll feel better.

363
1557
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:47,876
Will you be alright if you're alone?

364
1561
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:50,880
Of course! Don't worry.

365
1565
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,783
Hurry up and go.

366
1569
00:42:53,783 --> 00:42:55,184
I'll call you.

367
1573
00:43:22,678 --> 00:43:25,281
It's enough now, just give up, please!

368
1577
00:43:28,184 --> 00:43:30,520
Is it now my turn after father's . . .

369
1581
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,023
to be threatened by you taking medicine?

370
1585
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:18,064
Potter
Professor So Hyun Sub

371
1590
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:28,642
Your lips are like a pottery of Jone Comed

372
1594
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:05,445
Lips . . .
Huh?

373
1599
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,955
You've got lipstick there.

374
1603
00:45:15,955 --> 00:45:17,991
Thank you.

375
1607
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,864
You are the fourth.
Huh?

376
1612
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:27,500
You're his fourth girlfriend this year.

377
1616
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:38,278
For being that, you are much too beautiful.

378
1620
00:47:01,661 --> 00:47:03,329
Stop the car.

379
1624
00:47:09,902 --> 00:47:12,572
Aren't you past the age of crying in the middle of the street?

380
1628
00:47:17,643 --> 00:47:22,982
Girls, you know, sometimes think it's pretty to cry.

381
1632
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:25,351
But that's not true.

382
1636
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:35,395
Miss GaEul!

383
1640
00:47:40,432 --> 00:47:41,768
Miss Ga Eul!

384
1644
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:50,477
It wasn't me..

385
1648
00:47:53,445 --> 00:47:55,347
It wasn't me!

386
1652
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:56,082
Miss Ga Eul!

387
1656
00:47:58,818 --> 00:48:03,523
Miss Ga Eul!  Please!  Miss Ga Eul!

388
1660
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:09,687
Ah . . . two pair.

389
1664
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,864
You win? What do you have?

390
1668
00:48:11,864 --> 00:48:12,377
Yay!

391
1672
00:48:12,377 --> 00:48:15,602
What? Aish, there's nothing that goes right.

392
1676
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,674
You guys haven't gotten back together yet?

393
1680
00:48:21,674 --> 00:48:27,178
What do you mean get back together? Even if she were to get on her knees and beg,
 I wouldn't even blink an eye.

394
1685
00:48:27,178 --> 00:48:30,683
Well, let's hear the whole story. I have a feeling you're not completely in the right either.

395
1689
00:48:30,683 --> 00:48:41,426
Why wouldn't I be in the right?  I went on some double or triple date with her.  I ate some intestines or cow intestines for her.  I got rid of some a@#hole too.  I did all the right things.

396
1693
00:48:41,426 --> 00:48:44,063
Then you're not gonna see her even if she comes herself?

397
1697
00:48:44,063 --> 00:48:47,533
I'm telling you, I'm not letting this go.

398
1701
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:50,303
It won't work Geum Jan Di, you're just going to have to leave.

399
1705
00:48:56,842 --> 00:49:00,013
Hey, when did you come?

400
1709
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,986
I didn't know you were so mad.  I must have been thinking about myself the whole time.

401
1713
00:49:08,515 --> 00:49:12,303
Sorry. I'll just go.

402
1717
00:49:12,303 --> 00:49:14,661
Hey. Just go? Go where?

403
1721
00:49:16,278 --> 00:49:18,531
Since you came, you have to tell me why.

404
1725
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:24,270
Do you think this is the sort of place you can just walk in and out of?

405
1729
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:27,908
Goo Joon Pyo.

406
1733
00:49:35,946 --> 00:49:38,617
Please accept my apology!
(In Korean, "apology" and "apple" are spelled the same)

407
1738
00:49:49,628 --> 00:49:55,468
If an apology could solve everything, 
there wouldn't be a need for laws . . .
 and police??

408
1744
00:49:55,468 --> 00:49:57,303
It seems you already know.

409
1748
00:49:57,303 --> 00:50:00,773
What am I supposed to do?

410
1752
00:50:00,773 --> 00:50:02,675
Three wishes.

411
1756
00:50:02,675 --> 00:50:04,576
Three wishes?

412
1760
00:50:04,576 --> 00:50:06,212
Then I will accept your apology.

413
1764
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:09,247
What do you mean three . . .?

414
1768
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:13,006
That many?

415
1772
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:19,559
Guys, going against Goo Joon Pyo when he is right - is it a big sin or not?

416
1776
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,962
It's big.

417
1780
00:50:22,962 --> 00:50:26,666
All right, all right. I'll do it.

418
1784
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:30,404
But you have to say them all in one minute.

419
1788
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:30,932
Start!

420
1792
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,905
Hey! You can't do that!

421
1796
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:38,578
What do you mean I can't do that, I'm doing it.
  . . . 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 . . .

422
1801
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:43,082
Hey, wait. Stop that! Sit down for now.

423
1805
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:53,693
Hey stop! Stand up. 
 -There's only one left, 50! 51, 52, 53. 54. 
 STOP!

424
1811
00:50:56,061 --> 00:51:03,804
"Oppa, I was wrong." (cutely)
Say it.

425
1816
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,774
Didn't you hear?

426
1820
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:13,180
"Oppa, I was wrong", say that once.

427
1824
00:51:18,852 --> 00:51:20,186
Goo Joon Pyo

428
1828
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:25,592
Hey. Didn't you see how Ga Eul did it?
Say it after me. Let's do it!

429
1833
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:30,497
"Oppa, I was wrong!"

430
1837
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:43,241
Ah, I can't do it! I won't do it!

431
1841
00:51:43,241 --> 00:51:46,913
Whether you accept it or not, just do whatever you want.
I can't. I can't!

432
1846
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:51,584
Hey Geum Jan Di! Where are you going?

433
1850
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:54,920
That's why when she apologized, you should have accepted it.

434
1854
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,655
Are you going to give that back?

435
1858
00:52:00,393 --> 00:52:03,395
Hey! How can you eat that!

436
1862
00:52:03,395 --> 00:52:05,598
I was given this for an apology.

437
1866
00:52:26,385 --> 00:52:29,055
This thing . . . looks pretty fragile, right?

438
1870
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:56,982
It's stronger than it looks.

439
1874
00:52:56,982 --> 00:53:00,086
Do you know how long it took to make it that strong?

440
1878
00:53:03,255 --> 00:53:08,961
Sorted, stepped on, cut, then heated at 1300 degrees.

441
1882
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:12,932
That's not the end.

442
1886
00:53:12,932 --> 00:53:18,304
If after all that it's still not right, it has to be thrown out.

443
1890
00:53:18,304 --> 00:53:19,705
Like this.

444
1894
00:53:55,507 --> 00:54:02,981
To become strong, this is what you have to go through.

445
1898
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:05,985
Just like what you went through today.

446
1902
00:54:10,223 --> 00:54:15,560
I think I understand what you're saying.

447
1906
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,029
Thank you.

448
1910
00:54:19,231 --> 00:54:21,100
Then shall we go out now?

449
1914
00:54:22,912 --> 00:54:24,803
Where?

450
1918
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,239
I'm having a bad day too.

451
1922
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:29,809
At times like this, you just gotta let it go.

452
1926
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,779
Lets go! hurry

453
1930
00:57:06,518 --> 00:57:07,721
Who is that guy?

454
1934
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:13,605
So Yi Jung, isn't it?  F4 don't come to places like here . . . . What's going on?

455
1938
00:57:13,605 --> 00:57:16,863
Now that I see him, he shines, he shines!

456
1942
00:57:16,863 --> 00:57:18,725
F4?

457
1946
00:57:18,725 --> 00:57:23,876
What is that?
Handsome heirs.  Haven't you heard of F4?

458
1951
00:57:32,145 --> 00:57:35,569
Excuse me. . . 
Me, me?!

459
1956
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:37,873
Yes, please tell me!

460
1960
00:57:37,873 --> 00:57:45,288
Could I play a song?
Play?  Sure!  Go up, please. You can play all night.

461
1965
00:57:45,288 --> 00:57:46,360
Thank you.

462
1969
00:58:32,633 --> 00:58:36,009
There is someone here who has completely stolen my heart.

463
1973
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:47,821
I am going to play my heart for her.

464
1977
01:00:15,605 --> 01:00:23,117
Gosh!  I already said I was sorry! Why is he calling me to meet him all the way out here?

465
1981
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:34,361
Goo Joon Pyo. Do you really think I'd say, "Oppa, I was wrong"?
I would rather . . ..

466
1986
01:00:52,379 --> 01:00:56,450
You . . .
 You, you.  Again, you're so easily impressed.

467
1991
01:01:10,363 --> 01:01:11,865
Goo Joon Pyo.

468
1995
01:01:17,437 --> 01:01:19,173
How did you do all this?

469
1999
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:24,144
I tried to make this place look like the Champs-Elysees.

470
2003
01:01:25,422 --> 01:01:26,376
Do you like it?

471
2007
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:29,250
Yes, It's pretty.

472
2011
01:01:31,618 --> 01:01:32,920
It's really pretty.

473
2015
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:35,189
It's like Christmas.

474
2019
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:42,295
What's so good about Christmas?
 You don't like it?

475
2024
01:01:42,295 --> 01:01:44,898
Just think about it and you'll feel happy.

476
2028
01:01:46,215 --> 01:01:48,935
Not once,

477
2032
01:01:48,935 --> 01:01:50,170
do I remember being happy about it.

478
2036
01:01:51,758 --> 01:01:52,874
Why?

479
2040
01:02:16,229 --> 01:02:17,363
"Merry Christmas"

480
2044
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:25,271
"Mom"

481
2048
01:02:39,285 --> 01:02:41,003
So that's why.

482
2052
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:45,492
Hey, Geum Jan Di,

483
2056
01:02:48,561 --> 01:02:50,297
has the kimchi I made fermented?

484
2060
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:55,602
If someone hears, they'll think you made all that kimchi by yourself.

485
2064
01:02:57,961 --> 01:03:00,073
I want to eat it.

486
2068
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:01,196
Really?

487
2072
01:03:01,196 --> 01:03:07,748
Yes. I wanna eat the fish your mother de-boned too.

488
2076
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:14,855
The fishcakes your father bought for me were also delicious.

489
2080
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:22,395
I, uh . . .

490
2084
01:03:22,395 --> 01:03:28,834
I never knew what a family was like.

491
2088
01:03:28,834 --> 01:03:32,138
But after I saw your family,

492
2092
01:03:32,138 --> 01:03:34,041
I think, I get it a little.

493
2096
01:03:37,611 --> 01:03:39,946
Can I come over again?

494
2100
01:03:39,946 --> 01:03:42,215
Have you ever needed permission before?

495
2104
01:03:43,383 --> 01:03:44,818
This isn't a joke.

496
2108
01:04:01,067 --> 01:04:02,302
I want to come over again.

497
2112
01:04:05,472 --> 01:04:06,673
In fact . . .

498
2116
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:10,507
I want to come every day. . .
