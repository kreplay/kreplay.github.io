1
3
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:12,556
Is that all?

2
7
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:14,626
More!

3
11
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:15,828
Just try and do more!!

4
15
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:18,127
Attack!!!

5
19
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:34,045
Stop!!

6
23
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:35,914
Stop now!

7
27
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:38,016
Help me!

8
31
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:17,255
There's no one now.

9
35
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:19,457
No one is coming.

10
39
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:23,027
Even if that's the case . . 
Please, someone . . .

11
44
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,101
Get out of here!

12
48
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,772
Goo Joon Pyo?

13
52
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:02,200
Sorry.

14
56
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,771
I'm sorry.

15
60
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:26,057
I didnt do it.

16
64
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:28,059
It really wasn't me.

17
68
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:31,663
It doesn't matter just stop talking now.

18
72
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:34,366
You still don't believe me.

19
76
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:37,836
I do! I do believe you!

20
80
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:56,590
Let me do it.

21
84
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,092
Are you going to stay still or am I going to have to tie you up?

22
88
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:03,094
Are you stupid or ignorant?

23
92
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:06,497
Haven't you learned a thing? After going through all that?

24
96
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:09,567
When you're being  attacked like that, the 38th strategy is to escape.

25
100
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
In any case, you're really stupid.

26
104
00:04:13,938 --> 00:04:17,041
Your IQ is in the single digits, right?

27
108
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,811
You've got the brain capacity of an orangutan.

28
112
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,313
Orangutan?!

29
116
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:23,047
It's the truth isn't it?

30
120
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:26,717
It's because you're so foolish that your body had to suffer like this.

31
124
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:30,688
It's not the 38th stategy, it's the 36th for your information!

32
128
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:36,593
I don't want to hear it, 
from someone as dumb as you.

33
133
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:40,931
Close your eyes.

34
137
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:45,970
It hurts!

35
141
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,451
Wipe yourself!

36
145
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:02,287
Hey you!  Really!

37
149
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:03,475
Ahh a bug, bug! 
Get away! 
Go!

38
155
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:12,016
Get lost! 
Get lost!

39
160
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:16,554
You're okay now.

40
164
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:27,320
(Joon Pyo & Min Ji)

41
168
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:35,807
Why are you doing that? 
Don't do this.

42
173
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,381
You ugly thing. 
Who do you think you are saying I'm your groom?

43
178
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:47,818
You. 
Do you want to be kicked out of kindergarten? 
Huh?

44
184
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:51,589
Stop it.  
Stop it.

45
189
00:07:51,589 --> 00:08:02,100
Should just stop.  
 You pumpkin head.  I don't like people like you.  
Get lost.  I said, go home, ugly!

46
195
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,637
Why are you doing this? Don't do this.

47
199
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:18,010
Don't do this. Please. 
Don't do this.

48
204
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:25,823
You  guys don't know how I've lived after that day.

49
208
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:30,595
I couldn't even set one foot outside.

50
212
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:35,766
Because I was afraid and disgusted.

51
216
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:40,871
Because I was in so much pain and embarrassed.

52
220
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:52,784
I was terrified for three years and went to Germany. 
I was in so much agony when I had (plastic) surgery once every two years.

53
225
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:58,790
Do you know what I thought of, to get me through those times?

54
229
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:14,939
Yes, it's that expression.
 The expression you guys had when you treated me like a bug, a monster and ran away.

55
234
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:20,878
I've never forgotten that for a second.

56
238
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:25,482
I don't remember it but... I'm sorry.

57
242
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,086
No!

58
246
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,489
That's not it!

59
250
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:36,861
What I want to hear from you is not that you're sorry!

60
254
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:39,931
Hey.  
Calm down.

61
259
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:45,269
Look at me..

62
263
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,210
Am I not pretty?

63
267
00:09:54,873 --> 00:10:00,852
I became beautiful.  
Don't you like me?

64
272
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:14,231
Do you know who I came back for? 
Do you know how long I've been dreaming of this moment?

65
277
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:20,337
Say it!  
Say that you like Oh Min Ji!

66
282
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:28,746
Please say it,  that you like Oh Min Ji.  
I'm telling you to say that you like Oh Min Ji!

67
287
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:30,314
You're pitiful.

68
291
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,119
You're really pathetic.

69
295
00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:38,323
Do you know why?

70
299
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:45,229
Back then and now, 
you're still a monster.

71
304
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:57,542
No, you're worse than before.  
At least the girl back then had a beautiful heart and soul.

72
309
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,170
What is it?! 
What are you going to do this time?

73
314
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,338
I came here because I have something I need to take care of.

74
318
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:51,777
Something to take care of? 
 What is it?  
Forget it.

75
324
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,021
What are you doing?

76
328
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:10,796
You drag me to your house for the smallest things.

77
332
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:16,101
Then, should I have taken you to your house when your arms and legs are all torn up 
and your entire body looks like it's been covered in tomatoes?

78
337
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:19,771
Your parents would have been so happy.

79
341
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,644
I sent out a driver so they wouldn't worry.

80
345
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:32,351
And, your clothes and bag. 
 I threw them all out, so it's no use looking for them.

81
350
00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:38,289
Thrown away? 
You threw them all away?!

82
355
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:41,159
All you have to do is fix and wash it.  Why did you throw it out without my permission?!

83
359
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,395
How could it have been fixed 
and worn again in that state?

84
364
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:47,065
Why can't it be worn? 
 After all, I am the daughter of a dry cleaner!

85
369
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:49,967
Shut up!

86
373
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:53,972
Did you boil and cook the heart of a train when you're the size of a bell on a cat's collar??

87
377
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,741
What?

88
381
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,610
It's not the heart but the smokestack!


89
386
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:05,684
It canÂ´t be right  Think about it. 
  How can a person boil and eat a smokestack?

90
391
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,786
The thing that is boiled and eaten should be a heart.

91
395
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:20,599
What are you doing?  
Stay away from me!

92
400
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,492
Let's see that side too.

93
404
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,282
Ah , I feel like dying.

94
408
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:38,670
Your uniform and shoes, and everything else that you'll need.  I spent all night getting new ones.  The only thing is . . .

95
412
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,804
The only thing is?

96
416
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:45,076
There's just one thing  we need your approval for.

97
420
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:09,167
But,
 this is a bit different from mine.

98
425
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:38,296
18,000,000 won ($15,450).  Mine wasn't this expensive.  
Mine was a plain. . . a very, very, plain bicycle.

99
430
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:40,298
I'm sorry miss.

100
434
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:47,638
The young master ordered us to replace your things with the exact same items that were thrown out yesterday. But..

101
438
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:52,911
We couldn't find the exact same kind of bike that was burnt yesterday, however we tried very hard.

102
442
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,114
We tried our very best in purchasing these.

103
446
00:16:56,114 --> 00:17:02,019
Is there any way you can accept it with a generous heart?

104
450
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:06,825
But, 
even so, this price . . .

105
455
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,639
This is what the chef went through exceptional efforts to prepare..

106
459
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,041
That's Roast Wagyu beef..

107
463
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:27,411
An omelette with Alba truffles from Piemont..

108
467
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:33,818
Alba tri- 
 truffle.  Also called a "Song Ro mushroom".

109
472
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,824
But,
 I don't see Goo Joon Pyo?

110
477
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:42,994
The young master left early in the morning.

111
481
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:44,896
Where did he go?

112
485
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,833
Is that you, noona?

113
489
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,538
<i>Goo Joon Pyo</i>

114
493
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:09,486
Is your sister back?

115
497
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:15,360
Goo..  Goo..  
What's wrong?
 I asked if your older sister has come back.

116
503
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:23,134
This little guy is even stuttering now.  Didn't I tell you to be careful of the electromagnetic waves?

117
507
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:30,209
F... F.. 
 What's this?  Wow, whose son is this?
 He's very good looking.

118
513
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,743
He's here.

119
517
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:32,156
What?

120
521
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:33,636
F4!

121
525
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:34,879
What's that?

122
529
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,415
Shin Hwa Group successor, Goo Joon Pyo!

123
533
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:39,584
Shin Hwa Group?

124
537
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:43,922
What?!  
This guy?  He's here.?  At our house?!

125
542
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,566
HONEY!!!!

126
546
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,470
It's useless to call for me that anxiously.  
We only have one piece of cutlass fish.

127
551
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:27,365
You eat this as a side dish?

128
555
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:52,524
What kind of bug is this?

129
559
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,293
It's not a bug, but a fish.

130
563
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:59,130
What kind of fish is this small?

131
567
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:05,937
It's called an anchovy. 
  Ah, I guess you haven't heard of it before.

132
572
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:16,847
Since I didn't know what rich young masters ate... So.., at least eat this for now.

133
576
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:20,218
Ah!  I know this. This is kal...

134
580
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:26,991
Kal ... chi? 
(a type of fish / side dish)

135
585
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:33,932
-He knows kal chi!
-
How did you know?

136
591
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:49,747
That's not how you eat it...

137
595
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:17,474
"Addicted to plastic surgery .. Oh Min Ji's ugly past revealed"

138
599
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:23,314
Jan Di
 how could Oh Min Ji do this to you?

139
604
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:27,085
There's just a line you shouldn't cross even when stabbing someone in the back.

140
608
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:32,721
I mean, who did you go through all that pain for?

141
612
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:45,904
So scary. She's so incredibly vicious.  They say plastic surgery is so painful, 
you wouldn't want to do it again after doing it once..

142
617
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:51,875
It's no wonder she's so pretty with the number of times she's had plastic surgery done.

143
621
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:56,014
So true.  
  Does she even look human anymore?

144
626
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:04,924
If I looked like that then I would've committed suicide already.

145
630
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,534
Your eyes..

146
634
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,272
Your nose...
Teeth..

147
639
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:23,309
They're all bought with money, right?

148
643
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:27,547
If you want something, don't you buy it with money?

149
647
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:31,451
But can you buy beauty?

150
651
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:39,624
All of you have had plastic surgery done,  
so why are you talking crap about Min Ji?

151
656
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:47,232
So, it's okay for an already beautiful person to become prettier, but it's unsightly for an ugly person to do it?

152
660
00:22:47,232 --> 00:23:00,813
It's not something you get for free.  It's something that you get after going through unspeakable pain.  
So what?  What's wrong with that?  Can anyone say that Min Ji doesn't have the right?

153
665
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:05,852
If there is someone, come out and say something. Speak up!

154
669
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,208
About asking you for forgiveness..

155
673
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,345
I won't do it.

156
677
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,493
I can't even say . . .

157
681
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,896
"I'm sorry".

158
685
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:58,104
Don't  delude yourself by thinking I'll forgive you.

159
689
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,025
Jan Di!

160
693
00:24:57,197 --> 00:25:00,199
Jan Di...

161
697
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:07,440
Thank you . . . 
let's meet again.

162
702
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:23,623
Long ago, on Geum Jan Di mountain.
The place Maggie would sit and play.

163
707
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:30,096
I hear the sounds of the river flowers, my love Jan Di..

164
711
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:04,964
Everyone listen up!

165
715
00:26:07,353 --> 00:26:13,505
Under the name of Shin Hwa High School's F4,
 I have something to announce.

166
720
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:21,081
I am officially announcing that from today onwards, 
Geum Jan Di from 2nd year class B, is Goo Joon Pyo's girlfriend.

167
725
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,481
Hooray!

168
729
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,896
Listen up!

169
733
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:48,640
So from now on, doing something against Geum Jan Di is like doing something against Goo Joon Pyo.

170
737
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,178
All of you, don't even try. 
Is that clear? 
- Yes!

171
743
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,081
- Do you understand?
Yes!

172
748
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,851
I object to that decision.

173
752
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:05,325
Ji Hoo!!

174
756
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,731
I'm back.

175
760
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,076
But . . .

176
764
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,478
Isn't it too early for that prince to return?

177
768
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:33,418
But the fact is that he returned.  Doesn't that mean that there's a red light on the situation over there?

178
772
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,254
Maybe

179
776
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:40,058
If that's true, then shouldn't you be cheering in the bathroom?

180
780
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,195
Maybe not.

181
784
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:46,532
Ah, you can't now because of Mr. Goo or the leader or whatever, right?

182
788
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,301
It's not like that . . .

183
792
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:51,471
Then why do you look so down?

184
796
00:27:51,471 --> 00:27:56,776
Ah, I don't know. 
 I can't really say it's because of one thing, but...

185
801
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,712
I have this weird feeling.

186
805
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:00,947
What feeling?

187
809
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,618
Something's changed.

188
813
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:10,323
Well, that's because he came back from Paris! 
 Of course, he would become more attractive.

189
818
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:12,792
That's not it!

190
822
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,931
<i>Geum Kang San.</i>

191
826
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,333
What's the matter?

192
830
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:24,871
There's an emergency at home.

193
834
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:33,879
Mom! 
Dad! 
San, where are you?

194
840
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,549
Noona, I'm here..

195
844
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:42,789
Dad is here!
Jan Di, come  here and take a look  at all this.

196
849
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:44,457
What is all this?

197
853
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:47,259
Hyungnim (older brother) sent all of this.

198
857
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:52,999
- Hyungnim?
Ah, Joon Pyo Hyungnim!  Dining table, couch, TV, kimchi fridge. Nothing's been left out!

199
862
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:58,137
As for the beds, they couldn't fit because our doors were too small, so we had to  return them.

200
866
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:02,342
You know, the one with laces all over? The princess bed.

201
870
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:08,381
Oh, what a waste!  
We should've accepted it even if we had to bash our doorway!

202
875
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:10,783
How can you just accept it just because they sent it!?

203
879
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:18,791
But Jan Di, I also wanted to refuse. 
But, what crime did the delivery people commit?  
Those people have to drop off
 the stuff so they can leave.

204
886
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:23,696
What do you mean, return it!?  Its not like he's just doing all of this for us,

205
890
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:26,933
he also has his family to think about so he doesn't lose face.

206
894
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:33,071
If we live this poorly, then it won't look good on Young Master Joon Pyo either.

207
898
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,275
You should think things through before saying such thoughtless things.

208
902
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:42,881
That's not it.  How are we going to live when there's no room to walk?
  Do you want to live between the couch and the fridge?

209
907
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,752
FINE! 
We'll pack all this up.

210
912
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:55,328
We'll send it to your uncle's storage in the country side and use it for your dowry.  Does that work?  Huh?  Huh?

211
916
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,962
Dad!

212
920
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:01,067
Fine, okay. Even if it's a waste, we'll have to return it.

213
924
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:05,905
Just tell him, so that he understands, that you'll only accept the feelings.

214
928
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:08,207
I'm not even going to accept that.

215
932
00:30:09,616 --> 00:30:13,679
Noona,
 can't we at least keep the TV?

216
937
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:15,715
GEUM  KANG SAN!

217
941
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,969
Let's talk!

218
945
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,039
Oh, you really came?

219
949
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,941
What brings you all the way here?

220
953
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:47,145
Do you not understand Korean? I said, let's talk!

221
957
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,881
Move,

You're not going to move?

222
963
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,761
What the...   
What's wrong with this?

223
968
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,333
I was going to set a new record but you ruined it!

224
972
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:08,968
Why are you being like this?

225
976
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:15,007
Why are YOU being like this? 
Why are you turning someone's house into a moving center without asking!?

226
981
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:18,377
Ah,
  that!

227
986
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:22,148
Was there something you didn't like? 
If so, tell me. I'll just exchange it for you.

228
991
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:27,253
Hey!  
We already have beds, 
chairs, a fridge, a washer, and a TV !

229
997
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:29,055
But isn't it nice to exchange them for something new.

230
1001
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:31,324
But why are YOU doing the exchanging? 
Who do you think you are?

231
1006
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:34,360
What are you talking about?  
As of yesterday, I'm your boyfriend!

232
1011
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:40,933
Do you always do this when you get a girlfriend? You buy them clothes and a car, change their furniture?  
Soon you'll be changing my house!

233
1016
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:48,307
Actually, I was going to change the house first, but Chief Jung told me not to 

because the dry cleaning business was attached to it.

234
1022
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:52,778
What do you take me for? Am I like Shim Chung who's being sold to you?! 
 (Based on a legend, Shim Chung was sold to provide for her family)

235
1027
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:57,797
I told you, you don't buy friends with money, but you make them with your heart

236
1031
00:31:57,797 --> 00:32:02,755
I don't know what kind of girls you've dated before, but this really annoys me, okay!

237
1035
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,692
There wasn't any.

238
1039
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:12,965
I haven't dated any girls before.

239
1043
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:23,476
Well... 
 then it's okay this time.  But next time, be more rational!

240
1048
00:32:23,476 --> 00:32:27,780
Your temper!  Why do you always get mad at me when I'm trying to do something nice for you?

241
1052
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,271
Who asked you to do anything for me?

242
1056
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,777
Nice shot! Find the right position and throw it.

243
1060
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,683
But 
 Do you lounge around like this every day?

244
1065
00:32:40,683 --> 00:32:43,385
What, are you worried?

245
1069
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:47,790
There's a party today, so this is a special case.

246
1073
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,692
I usually don't let women in.

247
1077
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:52,027
Flies? What flies?
(homophones with "party")

248
1082
00:33:13,949 --> 00:33:16,485
What's up with  that rascal Ji Hoo?

249
1086
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:19,221
Is he back after becoming a real man in Paris?

250
1090
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:24,693
Seeing how he slept all day like a cat...

251
1094
00:33:24,693 --> 00:33:27,430
Now he's a bit more human.

252
1098
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,598
It's been a long time since I've been able to tolerate him like this.

253
1102
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:44,980
Jan Di, do you want to join our equestrian's club?

254
1106
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,016
Jan Di, today's my birthday party!
 You have to come!

255
1111
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:54,723
Look, over there!

256
1115
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:07,570
This is even scarier than
when they were bullying me.
Why are they like this?

257
1121
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,638
Nowadays you don't scream and shout anymore?

258
1125
00:34:10,871 --> 00:34:13,843
Sunbae!


259
1130
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:20,715
I guess old habits do die hard.

260
1134
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:27,289
Things here haven't changed, but it's weird because it's so quiet. 
 It doesn't suit it.

261
1139
00:34:36,598 --> 00:34:41,135
When are you going back?

262
1143
00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:48,911
I'm not going back.
 What about you? 
Are you  really going out with Joon Pyo?

263
1149
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:53,081
Uh...that.

264
1153
00:34:53,081 --> 00:34:54,750
Looks like it's true.

265
1157
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,120
Thatâ¦ actually.

266
1161
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,856
Did I come a bit too late?

267
1165
00:35:00,856 --> 00:35:03,491
Huh?

268
1169
00:35:03,491 --> 00:35:09,330
- I was hoping to ask you to go out with me.
What?

269
1174
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,600
I'm kidding.

270
1178
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,442
Then how about...

271
1182
00:35:20,442 --> 00:35:23,745
We date secretly behind Joon Pyo's back?

272
1186
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:27,750
Sunbae!!

273
1190
00:35:29,651 --> 00:35:33,122
It's still the same, the Jan Di baht (lawn) over here.

274
1194
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:38,027
I've missed it.

275
1198
00:36:29,778 --> 00:36:33,414
Would you look at that?

276
1202
00:36:33,414 --> 00:36:37,952
Who knew picking up a 500 won coin
could make you that happy?

277
1207
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:40,856
What are you doing here?

278
1211
00:36:40,856 --> 00:36:45,527
You threw such a fit complaining about
how you hated the furniture and electronics.

279
1216
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:47,863
But with one coin, you're grinning so big your lips can't even close.

280
1220
00:36:47,863 --> 00:36:55,236
That's because it's a lucky
Wait... Did you drop this?

281
1225
00:36:55,236 --> 00:37:00,442
As a reward for your efforts, I threw one to see. 
Pretty good results, no?

282
1230
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:03,278
Take it.

283
1234
00:37:03,278 --> 00:37:05,581
You keep it. Didn't you say it was lucky?

284
1238
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:10,019
From the moment I first saw you, my luck has become bad.

285
1242
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:17,058
No, your luck has become good. Extremely good.
What?
Let's go.

286
1248
00:37:17,058 --> 00:37:21,030
Hey? Can you not see that I'm here to work?

287
1252
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,165
It's only for a bit.
If you get fired, I'll take the responsibility.

288
1257
00:37:23,165 --> 00:37:30,105
Hey, can you not mention the
whole "taking responsibility" concept?
I get goosebumps just thinking about it.


289
1264
00:37:30,105 --> 00:37:35,844
Man, you talk a lot!  
Let's go!  
Just get in the car!

290
1270
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:48,624
Jan Di!
Ga Eul, where is Jan Di going?

291
1275
00:37:53,295 --> 00:37:54,329
Make everyone leave.

292
1279
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,932
Young master, 
if you keep doing this without letting me know. . .

293
1284
00:37:56,932 --> 00:38:00,969
Why would the owner need to request permission and ask for everyone's 
understanding everytime he decides to do something?  
Just shut up and make everyone leave.

294
1290
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:06,608
They say they'll have everyone out by 6, if you can just wait 3 hours.  
  You want me to wait 3 hours?

295
1295
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:09,845
I'll tell them again.  
  Forget it!  I'll take care of it myself.

296
1300
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:14,316
Where's that thing?

297
1304
00:38:14,316 --> 00:38:20,156
You're talking about that thing? 
 But, what is that thing?

298
1309
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:24,094
You don't even know what that is? 
 Wait a minute, customer!

299
1314
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:28,731
Start by firing her immediately! 
 What?

300
1319
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:41,176
Sir! 
Sir!

301
1324
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:28,757
I'm not going to wear that!!

302
1328
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,795
Let's go!

303
1332
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:12,301
Do you really have to go this far?

304
1336
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:21,107
I'm on my way, just keep your promise.

305
1340
00:40:21,107 --> 00:40:28,115
The arabesque ancient tea pot.
Don't ask for it back, or anything else.

306
1345
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:31,352
Okay.

307
1349
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:33,722
Turn the car around.

308
1353
00:40:39,594 --> 00:40:40,796
Why isn't she back?

309
1357
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:49,705
Ga Eul, you can't leave me alone and disappear again.

310
1361
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:53,308
Where else would I go? Jan Di's not even here.

311
1365
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:55,344
You're really not to go anywhere, right?

312
1369
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:10,058
Welco . . . . 
What's the matter?  I'm not Jan Di, I'm Jan Di's friend, Ga Eul.

313
1374
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:11,926
Hurry.  it's an emergency.

314
1378
00:41:11,926 --> 00:41:14,162
What's the matter?

315
1382
00:41:14,162 --> 00:41:16,999
Did something happen to Jan Di?

316
1386
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:22,738
What happened?
 An accident?

317
1391
00:41:22,738 --> 00:41:25,607
If we don't hurry, there's a chance we might not be able to see her.  Let's hurry!

318
1395
00:41:25,607 --> 00:41:31,580
What to do?
 I have to notify her parents.

319
1400
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:35,617
I've already contacted them.

320
1404
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:42,424
What should I do?

321
1408
00:41:45,661 --> 00:41:47,129
Let's go.

322
1412
00:42:04,613 --> 00:42:06,348
Jan Di!

323
1416
00:42:09,317 --> 00:42:11,686
What's going on?

324
1420
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:13,288
We're going on a trip.

325
1424
00:42:13,288 --> 00:42:14,523
A trip?

326
1428
00:42:14,523 --> 00:42:15,957
Yeah.

327
1432
00:42:15,957 --> 00:42:19,494
Impossible! 
I didn't even get permission from my parents!

328
1437
00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:20,762
I got it.

329
1441
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,765
What?

330
1445
00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:30,272
I already got their permission, and just in case they might be concerned with just you going, 
I brought your friend along too.

331
1450
00:42:30,272 --> 00:42:31,873
It's good now, right?

332
1454
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,678
Impossible!

333
1458
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,349
Let's take off!

334
1462
00:42:54,162 --> 00:42:55,864
Hey, the plane changed.

335
1466
00:42:55,864 --> 00:43:00,435
They said it would take over a year to get because the waiting list is so long.

336
1470
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:08,057
Ladies and Gentleman. Welcome you to aboard on Air Shin Hwa Flight 001. From Seoul to New Caledonia.

337
1474
00:43:08,057 --> 00:43:13,737
New Caledonia time is 2 hours faster than Seoul. And it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon over there.

338
1478
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:15,899
Local temperature is 27 degrees Celsius.

339
1482
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:18,568
Caledonia?

340
1486
00:43:21,604 --> 00:43:25,975
Are you so shocked that you need air? Shall I get you down the oxygen mask?

341
1490
00:43:25,975 --> 00:43:28,278
Goo Joon Pyo,

342
1494
00:43:28,278 --> 00:43:37,320
When did we become so close for you to take me on vacation with you? 
Even if we were that close,
you should have  asked me first.

343
1500
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,090
Do they not teach that kind of thought process at your Shin Hwa kindergarten?

344
1504
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:47,197
I wanted to go some place nice with you, so I took care of all the preparations. 
 It's not like something will happen
 to the RK if you're not there.  
So what's the problem?

345
1511
00:43:47,197 --> 00:43:54,704
I don't know about the Republic of Korea, but the porridge restaurant. If he finds out both of us are missing . . .

346
1515
00:43:54,704 --> 00:43:58,274
We cannot do that.  Let's go!

347
1519
00:44:12,555 --> 00:44:15,091
Will you take a seat please?

348
1523
00:44:43,553 --> 00:44:45,588
Seafood porridge is ready!

349
1527
00:44:47,691 --> 00:44:48,758
It's for us.

350
1531
00:44:54,297 --> 00:45:04,707
Eridanus, Epsilon Indi, Proxima Centauri . . .
That can't be the beauty of .human. 
F4! Fighting!

351
1537
00:45:04,707 --> 00:45:06,910
Master, four special abalones, please.

352
1541
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,045
Four special abalones?

353
1545
00:45:09,045 --> 00:45:10,445
Ok, yes!

354
1549
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:39,509
This is your captain speaking, We'll be arriving to Metro Island shortly.

355
1553
00:45:39,509 --> 00:45:43,313
We wish you a pleasant trip to New Caledonia, French paradise.

356
1557
00:45:48,217 --> 00:45:50,553
We're here! 
Wake up!

357
1562
00:49:11,587 --> 00:49:13,823
I feel like we're floating in the ocean.

358
1566
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,359
We are floating.

359
1570
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,428
Really?

360
1574
00:49:19,428 --> 00:49:21,330
Come here.

361
1578
00:49:38,548 --> 00:49:40,283
This can't be.

362
1582
00:49:43,786 --> 00:49:47,156
If there is a heaven, I always thought it would be like this.  Where are we again?

363
1586
00:49:47,156 --> 00:49:52,161
This is Metro Island. It's our own personal island and all resorts are ours too.

364
1590
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:54,430
Ours?

365
1594
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,366
Yes, Shin Hwa Group's.

366
1598
00:49:56,366 --> 00:49:58,868
Woo Bin's family bought an island too--in Dubai.

367
1602
00:49:58,868 --> 00:50:02,238
To be more accurate, they bought an artificial island that looks like Korea.

368
1606
00:50:02,238 --> 00:50:07,243
See, those jerks forgot Dokdo, so we decided to make one ourselves.

369
1610
00:50:09,678 --> 00:50:14,216
Since it's everyone's first time, excluding F4, shall we go on a tour of the island?

370
1614
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:14,496
Give this flower to the one you love.

371
1618
00:53:14,496 --> 00:53:16,432
What?

372
1622
00:53:20,002 --> 00:53:23,205
Love?

373
1626
00:53:34,993 --> 00:53:36,962
They are Koreans.

374
1630
00:53:37,863 --> 00:53:40,032
Excuse me, what is that?

375
1634
00:53:40,032 --> 00:53:45,137
There's a native who seems to be really good at fortune telling.

376
1638
00:53:45,137 --> 00:53:47,306
Fortune telling?
-Yes.

377
1643
00:53:48,307 --> 00:53:50,344
Fortune telling?

378
1647
00:54:20,205 --> 00:54:23,207
I see a man.

379
1651
00:54:23,207 --> 00:54:24,843
Man?

380
1655
00:54:24,843 --> 00:54:28,246
Your future husband.

381
1659
00:54:28,246 --> 00:54:36,454
Husband! 
Where? 
Who?

382
1665
00:54:36,454 --> 00:54:39,858
Here. 
With you!

383
1670
00:54:39,858 --> 00:54:41,459
And a soulmate.

384
1674
00:54:41,459 --> 00:54:44,062
Soulmate?

385
1678
00:54:44,062 --> 00:54:50,068
How great! Your soulmate will be your husband! 
 It's as perfect as the icing on a cake.

386
1683
00:54:50,068 --> 00:54:54,606
Two different men, two!

387
1687
00:54:54,606 --> 00:54:56,441
What is she saying?

388
1691
00:54:56,441 --> 00:55:02,881
So, her soulmate and husband are two different people?

389
1695
00:55:02,881 --> 00:55:04,983
You are losing something important.

390
1699
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:06,385
Losing?

391
1703
00:55:06,385 --> 00:55:09,021
Important?

392
1707
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:11,489
As a woman.

393
1711
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:17,295
Something important to a woman?

394
1715
00:55:27,605 --> 00:55:29,274
What is it?!

395
1719
00:55:33,078 --> 00:55:35,647
It was a dream.

396
1723
00:55:35,647 --> 00:55:39,684
Ga Eul . . . I, I had a dream.

397
1727
00:55:39,684 --> 00:55:41,953
What dream?

398
1731
00:55:41,953 --> 00:55:46,390
It was a dream, a dream. 
 What a relief.

399
1736
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:57,268
You and I, we went for a fortune telling. There was this lady telling our fortune. The lady said...

400
1740
00:55:57,268 --> 00:56:00,038
You're going somewhere with me.

401
1744
00:56:00,038 --> 00:56:01,405
Where?

402
1748
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:06,778
You'll know when we get there.
 Come on, let's go.

403
1753
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:13,684
- Ga Eul!
- Jan Di!

404
1758
00:56:13,684 --> 00:56:19,857
Jan Di!
Help me out here.

405
1763
00:56:19,857 --> 00:56:21,260
Ga Eul!

406
1767
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,428
Jan Di!  Take care!

407
1771
00:56:23,428 --> 00:56:26,597
Is she going to war now?

408
1775
00:56:26,597 --> 00:56:31,269
Wow, its so pretty!

409
1779
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:40,445
Hey, take a picture of me here!

410
1783
00:56:40,445 --> 00:56:44,516
You do all these tacky things by yourself, don't you?

411
1787
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:54,559
We're done now, right? 
Let's go.

412
1792
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,161
Wait a minute!

413
1796
00:56:57,161 --> 00:57:01,132
You saw the scene, and took the photo already, so were done right?

414
1800
00:57:01,132 --> 00:57:04,769
Done? 
We still have to go up.

415
1805
00:57:06,778 --> 00:57:10,342
Going up there?

416
1809
00:57:10,342 --> 00:57:12,644
Hey! This is my ninth time coming here

417
1813
00:57:12,644 --> 00:57:15,180
and you're the first person to actually go up there.

418
1817
00:57:17,788 --> 00:57:22,187
How'd I get stuck with someone like her.

419
1821
00:57:22,187 --> 00:57:27,225
Be patient, the blue and white porcelain...

420
1825
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:16,508
It's a good thing you came up, right?

421
1829
00:58:18,343 --> 00:58:19,877
You.

422
1833
00:58:19,877 --> 00:58:24,082
This is for lying about  Jan Di being in an accident and dragging me here.

423
1837
00:58:24,082 --> 00:58:27,951
Maybe it won't end up being a complete lie.

424
1841
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:31,923
It feels as though it will only be a matter of time before a real accident happens between those two.

425
1845
00:58:31,923 --> 00:58:34,659
No!

426
1849
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:36,661
What were you imagining?

427
1853
00:58:36,661 --> 00:58:43,167
Who's imagining what? 
Stop this and let's go.

428
1858
00:58:56,748 --> 00:59:00,018
What? 
Why is there nobody else here?

429
1863
00:59:00,018 --> 00:59:00,952
Is this a deserted island?

430
1867
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:03,988
Just you and I are here.

431
1871
00:59:03,988 --> 00:59:06,825
What's the reason you dragged me to a deserted island?

432
1875
00:59:06,825 --> 00:59:10,696
Reason? 
I don't have a reason,
but only something on my mind.

433
1881
00:59:10,696 --> 00:59:12,730
Goo Joon Pyo!

434
1885
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:19,705
I'm warning you.  
You should forget about any ulterior motives you had for bringing me on this trip.

435
1890
00:59:19,705 --> 00:59:22,073
Ulterior motive?
(*literally means 'black hearted')

436
1895
00:59:22,073 --> 00:59:24,876
What do you mean?
 A human heart or lead like from a pencil?
(*shim has many meanings, like 'heart' and 'lead')

437
1901
00:59:24,876 --> 00:59:32,517
Should I be more like you, who always takes things the wrong way and is so full of suspicion? Would that person's heart be more full of light?

438
1905
00:59:32,517 --> 00:59:35,421
Follow me.

439
1909
01:00:15,627 --> 01:00:17,795
How did you do this?

440
1913
01:00:17,795 --> 01:00:24,068
Didn't I tell you?
 Everyday, you be able to enjoy things you can't even imagine

441
1918
01:00:24,068 --> 01:00:28,806
Jan Di Baht (grass lawn), you act tough, but it's actually really easy to impress you?

442
1922
01:00:28,806 --> 01:00:31,509
This was easy?

443
1926
01:00:35,404 --> 01:00:38,315
It's like magic.

444
1930
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:41,886
Are you like a genie?
Genie?

445
1935
01:00:41,886 --> 01:00:45,190
Who is that jerk?
 Is he better than me?

446
1940
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:50,028
No.  The genie from Aladdin's lamp. He can grant any wish.

447
1944
01:00:50,028 --> 01:00:53,097
Ah, and I thought it was someone else.

448
1948
01:00:53,097 --> 01:00:56,401
But, can that genie do anything?

449
1952
01:00:56,401 --> 01:00:57,636
No.

450
1956
01:00:57,636 --> 01:01:05,076
There are some thing's a genie can't do. 
Like, killing a person, bringing a person back to life, and . . .

451
1961
01:01:05,076 --> 01:01:13,651
And?
  And? 
 Forcing people to fall in love.

452
1967
01:01:13,651 --> 01:01:16,187
It can't do that.

453
1971
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:24,629
Why are there so many things it can't do?

454
1975
01:01:24,629 --> 01:01:28,765
The more I hear about it, the weaker it sounds!

455
1979
01:01:28,765 --> 01:01:33,004
I can do it all. Whether killing someone or reviving them.

456
1983
01:01:33,004 --> 01:01:36,541
If you put your heart in it, it can be done. So just tell me what you want.

457
1987
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:38,609
Can you really?

458
1991
01:01:39,911 --> 01:01:42,880
Oh, I almost forgot.

459
1995
01:01:48,754 --> 01:01:51,422
Hello, this is Joon Pyo.

460
1999
01:01:51,422 --> 01:02:04,431
This is New Caledonia.  Jan Di Bat (lawn), no, I mean, Geum Jan Di is also here with me.  I'll give it to her now.

461
2003
01:02:04,431 --> 01:02:06,937
Mom!

462
2007
01:02:06,937 --> 01:02:11,876
Geum Jan Di, you're doing fine, right?

463
2011
01:02:11,876 --> 01:02:14,479
Ah! My daughter! 
Fighting!

464
2016
01:02:14,479 --> 01:02:17,115
Dad, I'm doing well here!

465
2020
01:02:17,115 --> 01:02:20,485
Noona, noona, is it nice there?
Have you eaten the big lobsters?

466
2025
01:02:20,485 --> 01:02:25,923
I'm sorry, San!
 I haven't yet.

467
2030
01:02:25,923 --> 01:02:30,094
No, no! Don't worry about us! 
Have fun!

468
2035
01:02:30,094 --> 01:02:39,137
Jan Di, be nice to Joon Pyo. 
This camera phone was sent to us by his secretary.

469
2040
01:02:39,137 --> 01:02:42,974
Noona, if you give me this phone, I'll forgive you even if you eat 10 lobsters alone!

470
2044
01:02:42,974 --> 01:02:50,414
Geum Jan Di, the fate of our Geum family is in your hands. Got it? 
Aja!

471
2049
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:17,508
Did I do something wrong? 
 I just . . .

472
2054
01:03:17,508 --> 01:03:23,980
No, Goo Joon Pyo. 
Thank you.

473
2059
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:26,450
Then why are you about to cry?

474
2063
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:36,093
It's nice here. 
 I wish my parents could be here too.

475
2068
01:03:36,093 --> 01:03:41,565
My family would really like it here.

476
2072
01:03:41,565 --> 01:03:45,302
We'll come together.

477
2076
01:03:45,302 --> 01:03:50,641
You and your family can come again together.

478
2080
01:03:53,711 --> 01:03:58,748
If you're done being touched, let's get to the point.

479
2084
01:03:58,748 --> 01:04:00,251
The  point?
