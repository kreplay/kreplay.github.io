1
3
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:07,917
Excuse me...

2
7
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,262
Excuse me...

3
11
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:26,503
Is anybody here?.

4
15
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:41,785
What exactly is this?

5
19
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:43,420
Smells good, right?

6
23
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:46,623
It'll be great for her skin.

7
27
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:49,125
For Geum Jan Di's sake, the pool will become a scented river.

8
31
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,796
How long are you going to peel all that anyway?

9
35
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:55,298
Wouldn't it be better to just fill it with water from a hot spring?

10
39
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:57,634
Why didn't I think of that?

11
43
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:02,505
Should your face really be like that while arranging a touching gift?

12
47
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:05,008
It's only because . . .

13
51
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,612
It's only because this is all I can do for her . . .

14
55
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,916
...it pisses me off.

15
59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,452
But, is it okay for you take photos with me dressed like this?

16
63
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:53,857
It's okay. It's okay. It's so good, very good.

17
67
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:58,761
These days, sexy school uniforms like this are the trend.

18
71
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:04,267
Looking as pure as a high school girl and having a child-like image is sooooo appealing!

19
75
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,902
What am I going to do?

20
79
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:09,405
Excuse me, I AM a high school girl.

21
83
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:11,407
Oh, right.  High school girl.

22
87
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,977
Ah, you said you go to Shin Hwa high school, didn't you?

23
91
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:17,714
Isn't that the school the rich go to?

24
95
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:22,018
It's undergoing a financial crisis these days.

25
99
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,120
It's hard lately, isn't it?

26
103
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,124
Don't worry, financial crises usually don't hit places like this.

27
107
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,797
Or maybe the more the economy falls into recession, the more this business is booming.

28
111
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:33,582
That's true, boss.

29
115
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:34,444
I know, I know.

30
119
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:36,299
Yes.

31
123
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:40,503
Now, shall we move on to the next cut?

32
127
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:42,639
Next cut, ok!

33
131
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,309
Next cut?

34
135
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:02,959
Hey.

35
139
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,728
I can't wear these.

36
143
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:12,268
Don't be shy and come out. I said they were good.

37
147
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:16,072
You people, are you sure you're making a leaflet for an institute?

38
151
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,441
What kind of clothes are these?

39
155
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:22,212
It's not going to work like that.

40
159
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,917
what are you doing?

41
163
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:31,521
You've got to finish what you'd started.

42
167
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:33,957
What are you doing?

43
171
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,452
Are you crazy?

44
175
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:38,962
Don't come any closer.

45
179
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:45,068
I'll kill you!
You, b#@$&, you're being a nag.

46
184
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:51,374
Go away! I'm a scary person. If you come any closer you're dead.

47
188
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,663
Hurry and let's go.

48
192
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,078
Your name is?

49
196
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,948
Not today . . .

50
200
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:34,216
What?

51
204
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:37,487
You'll see me again soon.

52
208
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:38,655
Huh?

53
212
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:41,138
If we meet again, I'll tell you then.

54
216
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:44,627
Have a good night, Miss Geum Jan Di.

55
220
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:46,796
Good-bye!

56
224
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:49,165
"Miss Geum Jan Di"?

57
228
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:50,366
Ah! Excu . . .

58
232
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:56,306
"Miss Geum Jan Di"?

59
236
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:06,749
Really?

60
240
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:09,419
So he knows you, right?

61
244
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,887
That could be it.

62
248
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,189
In any event, it's pretty cool.

63
252
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:14,624
Huh?

64
256
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,927
Hey. To rescue like that, isn't he like a Prince Charming?

65
260
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:21,631
Whoa, It's HaJe! Wow! He's on TV, he's on TV!

66
264
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,666
Isn't he so cool?

67
268
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,103
Not long ago he was saying the Prince of Andromeda was the best.

68
272
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:28,938
He is not faithful at all.

69
276
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:31,708
HaJe?

70
280
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,879
Jan Di, you don't know...

71
284
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:40,283
He's a new rising model.  His origin is unknown, his profile is unknown, his daily life is unknown.

72
288
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:44,153
He's the definition of a mysterious model.

73
292
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,623
If his face is on a product, it'll sell out the very next day!

74
296
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:53,863
Ta-da! Even getting a hold of this product was difficult.

75
300
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:57,200
Totally awesome isn't it?  Ahhh, so soft and moist!

76
304
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:08,811
Ah, I'm so hungry!

77
308
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:12,448
I seem to get hungrier these days without doing anything.

78
312
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:16,719
I should go take a nap at the pool.

79
316
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:01,897
This is all finished cooking . . .

80
320
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:08,004
You shouldn't let it sit here like this  it'll overcook.

81
324
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,563
You!  You!

82
328
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,437
Let me properly greet you, Geum Jan Di Sunbae (Senior)

83
332
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:16,705
Sunbae?

84
336
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:19,242
I'm Lee Je Ha, a freshman in Shin Hwa High school.

85
340
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:25,847
And, honestly I've been your fan, Sunbae.

86
344
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:26,716
Fan?

87
348
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:30,653
You are Shin Hwa's Joan of Arc, the commoner's heroine, resisting the forces of F4..

88
352
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:35,524
Heh, the commoner's heroine . . . Is too much.

89
356
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:38,594
By the way, I couldn't recognize you like that.

90
360
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:40,629
It's my concept.

91
364
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:41,264
Concept?

92
368
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:43,032
Star Concept!

93
372
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:46,068
Star?

94
376
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:50,105
Truthfully, I don't like anybody here.  I don't even want to make friends.

95
380
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:54,777
So I do my best not to be noticed until graduation, that's my goal.

96
384
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:57,146
LIke, a-lonely-loser concept?

97
388
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:03,382
Why are you laughing?
 Because you and I are similar.

98
393
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:06,055
Right? I thought so too.

99
397
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:10,893
I feel like only you and I are from same world in this school.

100
401
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:12,261
The same world?

101
405
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:23,072
I ate your ramen.

102
409
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:31,480
Sunbae, hello!

103
413
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,648
Hello!

104
417
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:41,290
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

105
421
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:44,760
Get lost
I'm sorry!

106
426
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:16,669
I'll set you up with a part-time job.  It's to run errands at a magazine and the pay's quite good.

107
430
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:42,327
It's been hard being able to meet with you.

108
434
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:44,530
Goo Joon Pyo!

109
438
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,136
Get in!

110
442
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:54,331
What do you mean by going to Hookkaido to eat crab?

111
446
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:57,376
Why do we have to go all the way to Japan to eat crab?

112
450
00:11:57,376 --> 00:12:00,379
It's the weekend. We can go look at the scenery (snow) as well.

113
454
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:03,148
If you don't want crab, we can go to Sapporo and have Udon or Ramen.

114
458
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:05,551
You want to go to Sapporo for Ramen?

115
462
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,721
Let's go. I will inform your parents on the way.

116
466
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:08,738
No, I can't.

117
470
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:10,789
Why are you always saying you can't?

118
474
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:15,594
You can. You definitely can. 
 Why can't you just say yes for once?

119
479
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,566
I have plans.

120
483
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:21,600
What plans do you have?

121
487
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:24,803
Today is Ga Eul's birthday.

122
491
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:27,138
What?

123
495
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:33,545
That's why I'm spending the night at her house. It's a 10 year unbroken tradition, 
so why don't you just leave it alone this time.

124
500
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,280
Am I more important or is Ga Eul more important than me?

125
504
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,348
Ga Eul.

126
508
00:12:41,786 --> 00:12:42,554
I will call you.

127
512
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,462
Hey!

128
516
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:52,965
She didn't even look back!

129
520
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,007
Is this YiJung?

130
524
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,444
Ok, I got it.

131
528
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:51,015
Congrats! Ga Eul, I heard it's your birthday.

132
532
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:51,650
What?

133
536
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:56,688
Oh, you are here...

134
540
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,024
You are here, Jeha...

135
544
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:00,650
Oh, you're here.

136
548
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,696
Hi Jeha!

137
552
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:02,557
Hello

138
556
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:05,158
You're here, JeHa
Hello

139
561
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:06,965
You seem to know them all very well.

140
565
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:09,601
It's been a long while that's why.

141
569
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,604
You're next.  Be prepared.
Yes.

142
574
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:18,176
Noona, this is the girl I told you about on the phone just now.      Ahh, your Sunbae?

143
578
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:19,311
Hello.

144
582
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:21,679
Please come this way.

145
586
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,349
I'll see you in a bit then.
-Don't worry about me, and just go.

146
591
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,396
It's very messy, isn't it? Please tidy them up.

147
595
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,464
Okay.

148
599
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,101
Then I'll leave it up to you.

149
603
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:17,002
Wow, it's HaJe!  HaJe!

150
607
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:18,844
Wow, you're looking good!

151
611
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:19,644
HaJe oppa, I can recognize you now.

152
615
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,732
You have a killer style.

153
619
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,132
You look really good.

154
623
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:24,399
He really does look good.

155
627
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,265
Look at him.

156
631
00:16:25,265 --> 00:16:26,732
He looks really good.

157
635
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:27,879
How do I look?

158
639
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:41,360
What's going on?

159
643
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,595
Are you surprised?

160
647
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,900
This can't be.

161
651
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,536
HaJe, it's time for your shoot now.  Come quick.

162
655
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:53,839
See you later.

163
659
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,768
Hyung, take a picture of us!

164
663
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:35,173
You both look good.

165
667
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:38,844
Who is this girl?

166
671
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:40,846
My girlfriend.

167
675
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,681
Hey.

168
679
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,452
By any chance, do you want to take part in the shooting?

169
683
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:49,788
What?

170
687
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,589
Me?

171
691
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:57,330
You know we should shoot photographs for next month's fashion magazine,
 the <i>"a drama-like, movie-like."</i>

172
696
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,820
Your partner hasn't been chosen yet.

173
700
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,102
Hey, I think the atmosphere is just right.

174
704
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,703
Let's do it, Sunbae!

175
708
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:08,006
How can I do that kind of stuff?

176
712
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,745
That much?

177
716
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,721
Am I okay for the shoot?

178
720
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:24,756
Yes. Of course!

179
724
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,315
Can you believe her?

180
728
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:03,955
She acts like she had an ancestor who died from dating!  She tries to avoid me whenever I ask her to go out.

181
732
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:06,358
Jobs on the weekdays, now her friend's birthday party on the weekend . . .

182
736
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,261
Doing all sorts of things . . .

183
740
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:11,329
Do you know how many part-time jobs she has?

184
744
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:16,101
Milk delivery, newspaper delivery. What is she? She's not even a delivery girl?

185
748
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:22,540
I was only trying to make it easier for her. 
 But apparently her friend's
 more important than her boyfriend.

186
754
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:38,358
Mmm.. It's delicious!

187
758
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:41,528
I'm buying, so have as much as you want!

188
762
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:54,307
What?

189
766
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,278
I was just thinking that my brother would have liked you..

190
770
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:00,480
Do you have an older brother?

191
774
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,081
Yes.

192
778
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:09,222
Thinking about it, Sunbae is similar to my brother's ideal type. I think that's why I want to get to know you better.

193
782
00:22:11,657 --> 00:22:13,526
Is your brother a college student?

194
786
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:15,929
No..

195
790
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:20,900
He's not healthy, so he's in the middle of a break.

196
794
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,909
You seem to be quite close with your brother.

197
798
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:35,013
He's the only family I have.

198
802
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:44,391
What's up?

199
806
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:47,059
I need to deliver something and I'm late!

200
810
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:56,736
Hurry, sit and eat it.

201
814
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:20,989
A poor lady had an affair with a rich lawyer and babies were born between them.

202
818
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:22,689
It's just an ordinary story of a family

203
822
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:28,961
You don't need to look at me so pitifully.

204
826
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:33,466
Because of  that, I don't live like a snob so I'm thankful for it.

205
830
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:39,872
Whoa. You really were impressed weren't you?

206
834
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:42,976
Girls always fall for that story

207
838
00:24:49,415 --> 00:24:54,487
Hey! You. What the heck?

208
842
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:57,624
Hey!

209
846
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,126
That way.

210
850
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:02,028
That way? Ah, this way?

211
854
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:04,701
That, that, that way!

212
858
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:09,368
That way?

213
862
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:10,636
Hey, hey, wait!

214
866
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,348
Sunbae!

215
870
00:25:22,348 --> 00:25:24,716
You are Yoon Ji Hoo Sunbae, right? I am..

216
874
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:25,552
Are you okay?

217
878
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:29,589
Yeah.

218
882
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:32,992
Joon Pyo came last night.

219
886
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:37,130
He felt bad that he'd been pushed aside for Ga Eul.

220
890
00:25:38,732 --> 00:25:41,100
Ahh.. That..

221
894
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:46,272
Today, I'll...pretend I didn't see you.

222
898
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,368
Joon Pyo, you're quiet lately

223
902
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:17,275
What?

224
906
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:22,743
You were complaining it was hard for you to see Geum Jan Di and to go on dates.

225
910
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:25,478
I'm going to change my strategy.
How?

226
915
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:29,515
I'm being too expensive so it makes her anxious to see me.

227
919
00:26:31,218 --> 00:26:34,254
Anyone think this will work?

228
923
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:38,725
Who thinks it won't?

229
927
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:41,094
You guys!

230
931
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,998
What is this you are wearing? It dosen't suit you.

231
935
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,002
This?

232
939
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:53,373
It's a bit tacky but somewhat warm.

233
943
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,743
Joon Pyo, because of you I overdid it with Miss. Ga Eul.

234
947
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:58,644
What did I do?

235
951
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:05,108
He seems to be really tall...

236
955
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:06,977
He is so good looking.

237
959
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:08,910
He's so hot...

238
963
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:13,059
He looks so good.

239
967
00:27:41,186 --> 00:27:42,522
Isn't she crazy?

240
971
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:47,760
That stupid girl!

241
975
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,698
With this handsome HaJe.. Stupid girl!

242
979
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:56,017
How did she get picked?

243
983
00:27:56,017 --> 00:28:00,237
- I'm getting so angry.
- We, Jin-Sun-Mee, should have been there! Not her!

244
988
00:28:00,237 --> 00:28:04,208
I'm not going to let this go.

Just wait until Geum Jan Di gets here!

245
994
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,988
She's bad.

246
998
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:09,115
Argh...so annoying!

247
1002
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,085
Geum Jan Di.

248
1006
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,617
Good to see you.

249
1010
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,492
Geum Jan Di!

250
1014
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:23,863
Even when we try to let things slide, you go and do things like this!

251
1018
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:27,300
You haven't had enough? After Joon Pyo, Ji hoo sunbae it's Haje's turn? How can you do this?!

252
1022
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,802
How did a person like you get with Haje?

253
1026
00:28:29,802 --> 00:28:36,142
You take F4 from us, and now you take Haje, the last person that gives us hope!

254
1030
00:28:36,142 --> 00:28:40,847
How could Haje fall for a commoner!

255
1034
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,598
I don't have any intention of giving you guys hope.

256
1038
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:52,558
HAJE!!!!!!!!!!

257
1042
00:29:03,695 --> 00:29:04,804
Sunbae. Let's go.

258
1046
00:29:07,106 --> 00:29:09,175
This can't be!!

259
1050
00:29:15,982 --> 00:29:16,883
Goo Joon Pyo Sunbae!

260
1054
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,352
What? Coming in so loudly...

261
1058
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:23,856
Have you seen this?

262
1062
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,324
What is that?

263
1066
00:29:38,738 --> 00:29:40,640
Is this really Geum Jan Di?

264
1070
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,207
Yes.

265
1074
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:52,919
Move!

266
1078
00:30:01,954 --> 00:30:03,294
You should let that hand go.

267
1082
00:30:05,196 --> 00:30:06,565
Goo Joon Pyo

268
1086
00:30:06,565 --> 00:30:07,700
Aren't you going to let go of her hand?

269
1090
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:18,411
As if those pictures weren't enough. Now, you're avoiding me for a trashy guy like this!

270
1094
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,848
Goo Joon Pyo it's not like that.

271
1098
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:24,449
Geum Jan Di you've changed a lot.

272
1102
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:29,888
What? You're in a magazine so now you think you're good enough to be a model?

273
1106
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:35,027
Tell me. Is this guy the reason you couldn't come to Hokkaido (Japan) with me?

274
1110
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:43,668
Yeah, try to argue with me that this guy is Ga Eul

275
1114
00:30:43,668 --> 00:30:46,572
Or... Was that day this guy's birthday?

276
1118
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:50,510
I'm sorry I lied. I was wrong.

277
1122
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:53,912
I'll explain...it's

278
1126
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:00,953
Did you just laugh?

279
1130
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:04,289
It's kind of funny.

280
1134
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:08,194
To the girl you like... Do you have so little faith in her?

281
1138
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:16,802
And...before you get jealous, shouldn't you first understand what kind of situation your girlfriend is in?

282
1142
00:31:29,098 --> 00:31:30,431
Get up!

283
1146
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,432
Say it again.

284
1150
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,333
What did you say?

285
1154
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:51,037
Who are you to start up anything?
 It's a waste.

286
1159
00:31:51,514 --> 00:31:52,982
What??

287
1163
00:31:52,982 --> 00:31:57,920
Jan Di Sunbae is wasted on someone like you...

288
1167
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,188
This bastard is crazy!!

289
1171
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:04,327
Stop.

290
1175
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:08,965
Stop it. Please.

291
1179
00:32:21,744 --> 00:32:24,478
He's someone who helped me outside of school.

292
1183
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:28,817
And at school, he's the only friend I could share my thoughts with...

293
1187
00:32:30,386 --> 00:32:32,488
The only one?

294
1191
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,161
Say it again.

295
1195
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:42,297
What is he to you?

296
1199
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:43,899
I can't breathe.

297
1203
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:44,800
Say it.

298
1207
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,703
It's too hard.

299
1211
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:53,543
Let's just . . . let's not do this any more.

300
1215
00:32:55,644 --> 00:32:57,512
Hey. Geum Jan Di!

301
1219
00:32:57,512 --> 00:33:03,519
I want to go back to the time before I knew F4 and Goo Joon Pyo.

302
1223
00:36:36,732 --> 00:36:38,400
It's a red card!

303
1227
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,169
Geum Jan Di got a red card!

304
1231
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:44,672
She's the first person to get one twice.

305
1235
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,414
Don't worry.

306
1239
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:58,020
From now on, Sunbae, I'll look after you.

307
1243
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:35,857
Hey, Geum Jan Di.

308
1247
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:38,560
Where's your desk?

309
1251
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,296
Looks like it's missing.

310
1255
00:37:41,296 --> 00:37:43,398
Hey, she doesn't have a chair, either.

311
1259
00:37:49,538 --> 00:37:51,506
Bye, Geum Jan Di.

312
1263
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:04,152
Watch out, Sunbae!

313
1267
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,611
It was Joon Pyo Sunbae.

314
1271
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:35,217
No, it wasn't.

315
1275
00:38:36,744 --> 00:38:39,555
Look over there. That's the F4's office.

316
1279
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:50,699
Goo Joon Pyo wouldn't do something like this.

317
1283
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:57,672
He's the one who gave you another red card. Goo Joon Pyo's is just the person who would do something like this!

318
1287
00:39:01,677 --> 00:39:03,398
No.

319
1291
00:39:04,112 --> 00:39:05,879
It can't be . . .

320
1295
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,536
There is no way. . .

321
1299
00:39:10,536 --> 00:39:12,321
No.

322
1303
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:15,350
Senior!

323
1307
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:29,430
Thank you.

324
1311
00:40:37,806 --> 00:40:39,207
It's been 15 years.

325
1315
00:40:41,476 --> 00:40:43,644
Huh?

326
1319
00:40:43,644 --> 00:40:45,380
Since I've known Joon Pyo.

327
1323
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:48,750
Oh.

328
1327
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:55,691
I don't believe you can ever completely know a person.

329
1331
00:40:58,893 --> 00:41:03,398
Even so, I do believe you know what kind of person Joon Pyo is.

330
1335
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:09,571
Do you think Joon Pyo did it?

331
1339
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:18,747
I want to believe in him, but . . .

332
1343
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:28,924
Whether you believe in him or not depends on you but . . .

333
1347
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:35,297
I only let you go because it was Joon Pyo.

334
1351
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:43,305
I didn't start anything with you because it was Joon Pyo.

335
1355
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,015
Don't make me regret my decision.

336
1359
00:42:24,888 --> 00:44:06,631
[Class has moved to the science lab] 

What's this?


            

337
1368
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,703
Help me!

338
1372
00:44:38,703 --> 00:44:43,769
Help me!

339
1376
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:45,236
Help me!

340
1380
00:44:45,236 --> 00:44:52,969
Help me!

341
1384
00:45:00,634 --> 00:45:05,329
Sunbae! Are you okay? 
 Move away!

342
1389
00:45:06,235 --> 00:45:07,862
.Are you okay? Hey!

343
1393
00:45:23,715 --> 00:45:25,198
What? 
 Wow!

344
1398
00:45:34,473 --> 00:45:44,522
Sunbae! 
Are you okay?
 Sunbae! 


345
1405
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:18,300
I told you I was going to protect you...I told you I was going to protect you...I will protect you no matter what.

346
1409
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,066
The number you have just reached is currently unavailable.

347
1413
00:48:15,985 --> 00:48:42,093
Yes, it's me. 
 Of course 
 Do you know where Geum Jan Di is right now? 
Would you believe me if I told you she was sleeping on my bed 
 Just prepare to transfer the money.


348
1422
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:50,107
Ah... of course the high and mighty president wouldn't be the one to get her hands dirty.

349
1426
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:46,530
This kid is pretty impressive
 President, shall I pour you some champagne?
That sounds great.


350
1433
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:05,838
Thank you.

351
1437
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:21,690
.

352
1441
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:22,820
.

353
1445
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:40,690
Joon Pyo. Has Anyone been able to contact him? 
- I called every place that I could think of, but no luck.

354
1450
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,690
What's Geum Jan Di's relationship with that guy?

355
1454
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,856
Are they really breaking up this time?

356
1458
00:50:44,856 --> 00:50:49,123
Oh my Gosh. Who are you to look for the F4?
- I said, I've got business with them!

357
1463
00:50:49,123 --> 00:50:51,866
Hey!

358
1467
00:50:51,866 --> 00:50:54,290
Ga Eul

359
1471
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,756
What are you doing here?
- Please help me.

360
1476
00:51:07,456 --> 00:51:14,393
She didn't show up at work. And she hasn't picked up her phone all morning, so I called her house. 
- So her parents told you your boss called and told them she was out with the F4.

361
1481
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:17,490
Master never made that call! 
I know that.

362
1486
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:27,890
What are we going to do? 
 Where is Jan Di?
What if someone kidnapped her or something?

 It'll be a relief if that someone was Joon Pyo.

363
1494
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:44,690
Hey, Chief Lee. It's me. 
I need you to find someone urgently. Two people. 
 Yes.
 Get everyone out searching for them.

364
1501
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,000
Call Joon Pyo.  Jan Di is in danger.

365
1505
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:51,790
Before you get jealous, shouldn't you first find out what's going on with your girlfriend?

366
1509
00:53:23,991 --> 00:53:28,863
Manager Jeong. Prepare my plane.

367
1513
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,869
Are you feeling better now?

368
1517
00:54:07,504 --> 00:54:08,972
Where am I?

369
1521
00:54:08,972 --> 00:54:10,074
My place.

370
1525
00:54:11,198 --> 00:54:12,810
Your . . . home?

371
1529
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:16,480
You inhaled a lot of gas and must have went into shock.  You've been asleep since yesterday.

372
1533
00:54:19,316 --> 00:54:22,017
Yesterday?

373
1537
00:54:22,017 --> 00:54:27,190
Then I haven't even been home and have been here for 2 days?

374
1541
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,960
I called your house because I figured they'd be concerned.

375
1545
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,828
I told them you went on a trip with friends.

376
1549
00:54:31,828 --> 00:54:36,634
- With friends? 
 -  When I said F4, they weren't worried.

377
1554
00:54:48,746 --> 00:54:50,614
I'll get going now.

378
1558
00:54:50,614 --> 00:54:52,349
Thank you.

379
1562
00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:53,551
Do you still trust that person [Goo JoonPyo]?

380
1566
00:54:55,886 --> 00:55:01,058
Even after all of this, are you still heart broken when you think of Goo Joon Pyo?

381
1570
00:55:03,626 --> 00:55:05,763
He almost killed you!  Twice, at that!

382
1574
00:55:07,564 --> 00:55:11,969
If he can't have you, he won't be happy until he ruins you. That's the kind of person he is!

383
1578
00:55:11,969 --> 00:55:14,936
Don't say another word!

384
1582
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,108
There's something about Goo Joon Pyo that I know and you don't.

385
1586
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:23,514
No, I know.
You're the one that doesn't know.

386
1591
00:55:23,514 --> 00:55:25,382
Why are you doing this?

387
1595
00:55:25,382 --> 00:55:30,587
Way before you even met him, I've known the kind of person he is.

388
1599
00:55:30,587 --> 00:55:37,561
With the exception of F4, he doesn't see people as people.
He views the lives and happiness of  other people as something as insignificant as an insect.

389
1604
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:44,234
No, 
he used to be like that, but not now.

390
1609
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:47,141
That's not all there is to Goo Joon Pyo.

391
1613
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,709
Once you get to know him . . .

392
1617
00:55:55,279 --> 00:55:56,113
Give up.

393
1621
00:55:58,414 --> 00:56:01,819
From the beginning, you and him weren't meant to be.

394
1625
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,722
Be with me.

395
1629
00:56:05,722 --> 00:56:08,791
Don't we get along?

396
1633
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:12,330
Sunbae, aren't we of the same world?

397
1637
00:56:20,403 --> 00:56:24,710
We were only friends. You were someone I was really thankful,

398
1641
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:29,379
but . . . I can't . . .

399
1645
00:56:29,379 --> 00:56:33,451
Do you still trust him? After all the things that he's done to you?

400
1649
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:35,753
I do.

401
1653
00:56:37,822 --> 00:56:39,289
I trust him.

402
1657
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:45,628
Because . . . Goo Joon Pyo trusted me.

403
1661
00:56:45,628 --> 00:56:46,897
Because Goo Joon Pyo would trust in me.

404
1665
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:08,451
You'll regret this.  Wake up already!

405
1669
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:17,561
I'm more awake now than I've ever been before. I know what I did wrong and
 what Goo Joon Pyo means to me now.

406
1674
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:20,998
I'll be leaving now.

407
1678
00:57:30,172 --> 00:57:38,179
Je Ha's world, Joon Pyo's world, there's no difference.

408
1682
00:57:38,179 --> 00:57:44,554
If they exist in the same place and are surrounded by the same things, then there's no difference.

409
1686
00:58:06,508 --> 00:58:10,714
I warned you that you'd regret this.

410
1690
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,593
Young Master.

411
1694
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:25,962
You haven't called.

412
1698
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:29,032
Your F4 friends have been very worried . . .

413
1702
00:58:29,032 --> 00:58:30,400
Why should they be worried about me?

414
1706
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,170
It's not about that.  It's about Miss Geum Jan Di.

415
1710
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:37,140
Jan Di? What happened to Jan Di?

416
1714
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,943
I don't know the details.

417
1718
00:58:42,096 --> 00:58:43,714
Here is a letter for you.

418
1722
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,822
[If you want to save Geum Jan Di, come alone.]

419
1726
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,712
Is there a problem?

420
1730
00:59:16,712 --> 00:59:19,948
It's nothing.

421
1734
00:59:19,948 --> 00:59:22,519
Butler Lee, I'm a little tired so I think I'm going to go upstairs and sleep.

422
1738
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:24,254
At this time?

423
1742
00:59:24,254 --> 00:59:25,756
Tell everyone not to bother me.

424
1746
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:29,860
Why am I so tired?

425
1750
01:00:04,528 --> 01:00:05,863
Joon Pyo came in, right?
Is he in his room?

426
1755
01:00:05,863 --> 01:00:07,697
Young master said . . .

427
1759
01:00:07,697 --> 01:00:11,402
Uh, young masters.
Don't worry.
Even if he makes a fuss.
We'll take care of it.

428
1766
01:00:12,603 --> 01:00:15,305
Joon Pyo.  Goo Joon Pyo!

429
1770
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:21,745
Joon Pyo.
Joon Pyo, get up!  Are you really going to act like this?

430
1775
01:00:27,984 --> 01:00:29,086
Something is wrong.

431
1779
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:35,292
Joon Pyo!  Joon Pyo!

432
1783
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:41,965
Guys, over here.

433
1787
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,745
As soon as he came back, there was a weird letter . . . 
 Letter?

434
1792
01:01:22,567 --> 01:01:23,840
Guys, go out and check if he's coming.

435
1796
01:01:34,985 --> 01:01:37,287
Your eyes tell me you have a lot to say,

436
1800
01:01:37,287 --> 01:01:38,671
Jan Di Sunbae.

437
1804
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:02,244
What's your true identity?

438
1808
01:02:02,244 --> 01:02:04,113
Why are you doing this?

439
1812
01:02:04,113 --> 01:02:05,248
I have a reason

440
1816
01:02:06,983 --> 01:02:08,418
Two reasons.

441
1820
01:02:08,418 --> 01:02:09,453
Two?

442
1824
01:02:10,339 --> 01:02:14,739
The incidents at the part-time job, the red card, and the classroom.

443
1828
01:02:17,127 --> 01:02:19,528
They were all done by me.

444
1832
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:20,597
You didn't know they were me, right?

445
1836
01:02:24,834 --> 01:02:27,435
Jan Di Sunbae

446
1840
01:02:27,435 --> 01:02:28,905
Look closely.

447
1844
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:32,042
Do I look like someone . . .

448
1848
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:35,212
you might have seen before?
