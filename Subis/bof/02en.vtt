Be quiet!

"Let go of me!" "I said be quiet!"

7
28
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:44,979
Attacking in a group, huh?

00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:51,386
Huh? Oh, this is, uhmmm...

9
36
00:00:57,092 --> 00:01:04,866
You. Those pancakes, did you leave something out?

10
40
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:07,034
Huh?

11
44
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:12,407
I did as you told me, but the pancake didn't rise.

12
48
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,679
Maybe, baking powder?

13
52
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:20,947
Yes, that.

14
56
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:27,688
And, they sell it too right? Pancake mix?

15
60
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,391
Could you?

16
64
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,531
Why are you guys still here?

17
68
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,933
That's, Joon Pyo sunbae  . . .

18
72
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:42,035
Why don't you guys leave now?

19
76
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,405
Aish.

20
80
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,774
What are you doing? Aish.

21
84
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,567
You even have goose bumps.

22
88
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:24,912
Baking powder, huh?   I'll have to try it again.

23
92
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,948
Sunbae . . ..

24
96
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:32,420
thank you, for helping me.

25
100
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,458
I wasn't helping you, this kind of stuff just annoys me.

26
104
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,338
What? Ji Hoo did?

27
108
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:53,608
Yeah, he had to appear at that moment.

28
112
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:56,878
Who told you guys to do that kind of stuff?

29
116
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,281
You said to give Geum Jan Di a bitter taste.

30
120
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,551
I told you to scare her. Who told you to go that far?!

31
124
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,720
We're sorry. We were wrong.

32
128
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,155
You want me to make you guys stop coming to school, too?!

33
132
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,791
Get lost!  I don't even want to see your faces.

34
136
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,760
I said get lost!

35
140
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,666
Jan Di, are you really okay?

36
144
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,035
Nothing major really happened.

37
148
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,304
That's nothing?

38
152
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:28,443
That F4 or whatever,  I was going to let them
off easy because they're good-looking!

39
157
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:33,247
Those kinds of people tend to hang out with people
 just like them. So it's the four of them, huh?

40
162
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,950
Well, it's not really like that.

41
166
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,352
What do you mean that it's not like that?

42
170
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:41,122
One of them seems to be kind of different.

43
174
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:45,593
One of them? Who?

44
178
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:22,229
Wow! This commercial is really killer.

45
182
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,097
Sunbae, you seem to really like her.

46
186
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:04,772
Even so, you shouldn't put your hands on there.
 They'll turn black and dirty.

47
191
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,077
She's really pretty, isn't she?

48
195
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:47,148
This is called "The Advent of a Goddess."

49
199
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,049
Goddess?

50
203
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:50,952
This unni is not just pretty.

51
207
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:53,020
She is very smart,  and

52
211
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,257
she donated all the money she earned from her modeling job

53
215
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:01,328
She passed the French Bar exam a while ago too.

54
219
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:05,132
Do you know all this  stuff about her?

55
223
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:09,770
Of course. She is my idol.

56
227
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,939
Idol?

57
231
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:21,015
People expect she will be the successor
of her parents' law firm after graduation.

58
236
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:22,850
But I think a little differently.

59
240
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:29,423
I think she's going to do something better and greater.

60
244
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:36,163
Every vacation she goes to Africa, Afghanistan,
 recently she visited Tibet too.

61
249
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:47,875
This is just my imagination, but I'd like to see if she marries
a royal family member or the President or something like that.

62
254
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:56,651
Like a princess who devotes herself to world
peace like Princess Diana or Audrey Hepburn. Sort of....

63
259
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:00,454
She is just a model.

64
263
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:07,661
So? The President of France divorced to marry a model.

65
267
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:15,968
Who knows? Someone who deserves to be a future French President or some prince of Europe might fall in love with and propose to her.

66
271
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:22,243
I think it is a quite practical scenario.  Don't you think so?

67
275
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:27,313
Whenever I see you, you are very annoying and noisy.

68
279
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,118
Eh?  I just . . .

69
283
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,792
What would you know?

70
287
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,042
Hey, Kang San! Aren't you going to eat?

71
291
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,746
You were online all day long!

72
295
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,848
Is food or money coming out of it?

73
299
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,783
Electromagnetic waves are coming out.

74
303
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:06,154
San, be careful! You can cut our family line.

75
307
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:10,725
Money as well as food comes out! How could
you have no idea about the king of Sarbeit!

76
312
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:11,958
Sar.. what?

77
316
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,061
Cyber Arbeit (Internet part time job).

78
320
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,464
The ones who move the world might be the rich.

79
324
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,735
The ones who entertain the world
are Oh-Duk-Hoos(Otakus) like me.

80
329
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,705
Now he forgets even his own name after
eating a bunch of electromagnetic waves.

81
334
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,139
Oh, gross.

82
338
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,477
Eh! What's this?

83
342
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,211
Hmjommoo??

84
346
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:36,849
Oh, boy. I've never heard of a
moth-eaten (jom) radish (moo).

85
351
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:44,590
Honey, it's not that. It means "a radish
with little (jom) defects(hm)"

86
356
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:51,032
Hmjommoo means "Hm, if it is true, it is a little bit scary"

87
360
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:51,699
Eh?!

88
364
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,200
Noona! this is a complete scoop!

89
368
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,569
scoop?

90
372
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:59,139
It says at Noona's school, someone got pregnant!

91
376
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,941
WHAT?

92
380
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:11,119
Look at this! 2nd year girl of Shin Hwa high school,
 identified only as "K," is rumored to have a risqué private life.

93
385
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:14,954
She was spotted coming out from a lying-in hospital.

94
389
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:19,493
2nd year K, then that person could 
be the same age as you!

95
394
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,828
K? Could it be Kim?
Or Kang, Kang!

96
399
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,865
There's Kwon too

97
403
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:28,236
Oh my, how could a 2nd year student get preg-
Oh my goodness.

98
408
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:32,106
How could this sort of thing happen at Shin Hwa?

99
412
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:35,609
What happened to daughters from good families!

100
416
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:39,080
Daughters from good families are more scary.

101
420
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,226
You have a message!

102
424
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:54,862
Breaking News on 2nd year K has been disclosed!!

103
428
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:09,143
What are you looking at?
How great of a person could you be to cause so much trouble?

104
433
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:13,162
If you're so great I dare you to show yourself to me.

105
437
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:19,033
As a commoner..

106
441
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:29,010
(Dating 1 truck of guys)

107
445
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,678
(She's insane!)

108
449
00:10:30,678 --> 00:10:33,414
(a piece of crap)

109
453
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:35,283
(Jan Di, die!!)

110
457
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:36,751
(Who's the father?)

111
461

(Anti-abortion)
(Ashamed...beggar...)

112
466
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,260
- It's quiet today for some reason. 
 - What do you mean?

113
471
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:55,837
2:50 PM

114
475
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:57,238
Ah..!

115
479
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,400
Wait a bit. 
She'll show up sooner or later.

116
484
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,245
What did you do this time?

117
488
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:07,615
Why? 
Want to find out so you can go save her again?

118
493
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,517
What are they talking about?

119
497
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:11,753
Just stop it. forget about it.

120
501
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:14,455
When did you become such a nosy person?

121
505
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:16,691
If you're not going to help me, don't butt into my business.

122
509
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:20,094
Doing this to a girl... it's not funny it's just childish.

123
513
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:22,397
Do you see her as a girl?

124
517
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:25,700
She's a fledgling acting like she's superior and going on a rampage.

125
521
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:33,141
Whoever it is fledgling or puppy, I will thorougly crush
those who defy me. Don't you know the rules?

126
526
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:50,792
You erased it, did you?  Too bad, though.
What are you going to do about this?

127
531
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:56,831
(Breaking News! 2nd year K turned out to be Geum Jan Di!)

128
535
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:18,319
Everyone! Isn't there a strange smell?

129
539
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:21,355
What in the world could smell this bad?

130
543
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:24,793
It smells like rags.

131
547
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:28,762
I think I'm going to suffocate to death!

132
551
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:31,432
Hey Sunny, give me some perfume.

133
555
00:12:35,203 --> 00:12:38,706
How can we study in a classroom with this stench?

134
559
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:56,391
I can't stand this.
 I can't stand this anymore!

135
564
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,300
Can't stand this? What are you going to do then?

136
568
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:14,108
She appears, with a touch of the devil in her.

137
572
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:14,642
Oh.....

138
576
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:18,045
Woah! -Didn't I tell you?
She was going to come sooner or later.

139
581
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:22,417
You're a bit late in saying you're sorry.

140
585
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,119
You've tried the last bit of my patience!!

141
589
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:30,825
That's my warning to you. Okay?

142
593
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:38,132
Hey, laundry girl, is this the kind of apology all commoners give?

143
597
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:42,603
In the world of the wealthy, does the victim apologize to the wrong doer?

144
601
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:51,112
What? 
WHAT?

145
606
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:05,359
You, what are you doing?

146
610
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:14,869
Didn't I tell you? You've tried the last bit of my patience. 
I told you, you jerk I TOLD YOU!

147
615
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:17,004
AHHHHH!

148
619
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:38,025
Did you see me? 
Did you ever see me sleeping with a guy, or even holding hands with one? DID YOU SEE ME?

149
624
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:43,431
I haven't even had my first kiss yet, and you're going to spread what kind of rumors about me?!

150
628
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:53,174
You!

151
632
00:14:57,812 --> 00:15:03,618
If you keep going on like this, you're
 dead meat next time!

152
637
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,795
She is really something!

153
641
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:54,168
She dominated the great Goo
Joon Pyo with a preemptive strike.

154
646
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:58,873
Going to school and having something
interesting to see. It's been a long time.

155
651
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:03,878
But, doesn't the tiny tot look like someone?

156
655
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:09,550
You're right. That's what I thought, too.
Hmm, who could it be?

157
660
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:13,154
Joon Hee Noona!

158
664
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:15,790
What? Don't try to be funny.

159
668
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,113
No, no.  She really acts like her.

160
672
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:22,563
That plain tacky girl? 
How is she like my Sister at all?

161
677
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:24,865
You would know better.

162
681
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:26,667
Shut up!

163
685
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:30,738
Why were you all giddy with yourself earlier?

164
689
00:16:30,738 --> 00:16:33,574
Did you hit your head somewhere?

165
693
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:37,478
You guys still haven't noticed?

166
697
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:38,346
What?

167
701
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:45,886
I think that chick has completely
fallen head over heels for me.

168
706
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,655
What?

169
710
00:16:48,522 --> 00:16:53,994
Joon Pyo, is there any possible
way to explain what you're saying?

170
715
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:59,533
Aren't you guys supposed to be pros at getting girls?

171
719
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:02,703
They say a girl's "No" is really a "Yes".

172
723
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:09,043
As much as she's screaming out that she doesn't like me, she's falling for me in actuality.

173
727
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:10,378
Uh-huh?

174
731
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:18,819
Think about it. For fear of being discovered
 by the one she loves she came in person 
making a fuss about first kisses and other nonsense.

175
737
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,789
If that's the logic...

176
741
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:23,624
Saying she's never kissed anyone...

177
745
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:28,396
That means 
she's waiting to have her first kiss with me.

178
750
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:34,101
Bravo!! You really are something Goo Joon Pyo.

179
754
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:36,704
Even as my friend, You really are something this time.

180
758
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:39,507
Well of course.

181
762
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:45,613
I thought it was weird that Goo
Joon Pyo's charisma didn't work on someone.

182
767
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:48,482
Idiot chicken!

183
771
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:53,587
She thought I would be deceived
if she talked to me in an angry tone.

184
776
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:58,492
A girl being too frank makes a
man feel burdened, doesn't it?

185
781
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:39,834
Do you have to go to school this way, Geum Jan Di?

186
785
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:45,506
My bad temper always gets me in trouble.

187
789
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:48,690
Why did you provoke him?

188
793
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,882
Are you Miss Geum Jan Di?

189
797
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:58,085
Yes, but . . . .

190
801
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:00,855
Will you come with us for a bit?

191
805
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:07,261
What? 
Where? 
I'm just a bit busy right now.

192
811
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:09,997
We have received orders to bring you.

193
815
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:12,633
From who?

194
819
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,969
You'll find out if you come with us.

195
823
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:16,337
But....

196
827
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:26,080
I, I have to go to my part-time job, so I'm a bit busy.  
Sorry.

197
832
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:34,188
Ahh!  Misters, why are you following me?

198
836
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:49,537
She's not there either?

199
840
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:50,571
No, sir.

200
844
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:52,806
Well let's go look for her again.  You guys over there, we'll go over here.

201
848
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:54,041
Yes, sir.

202
852
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:20,062
Come with us.

203
856
00:20:20,062 --> 00:20:24,200
Woahh! Mister 
let me down!

204
861
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:30,639
Let go of me!

205
865
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:33,175
- What are you doing? 
 - Stay still!

206
870
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:38,147
- What the heck? 
 - Stop this! What are you doing?

207
875
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:41,317
Let's leave.

208
879
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:56,031
Mmmm, what a smell. 
Smells like some nice flowers.

209
884
00:20:56,031 --> 00:21:03,406
Warm, soft . . .  my body . . . my body . . . .

210
888
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:05,808
Someone's touching it?!

211
892
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:14,081
We don't need suction, do we?

212
896
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:16,652
No need. Since it's not fat but muscles, it won't be effective.

213
900
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,220
Is the laser set?

214
904
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,189
Take off the wax before doing it.

215
908
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,100
♫ <i>Stand by me, please look at me</i> ♫

216
912
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,700
♫ <i>Even though I don't know much about love yet</i> ♫

229
964
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:52,815
I think they are surprised because this is the first time

230
968
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:56,919
Young Master has ever brought a woman home.

231
972
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,422
Uhmm, can I ask you a question?

232
976
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:03,591
Yes.

233
980
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:09,197
Well... This is... Korea, right?

234
984
00:23:09,197 --> 00:23:10,933
Yes, that's right.

235
988
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:14,436
Am I at the Blue House or the something like it?

236
992
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,638
No.

237
996
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:19,074
I have one more question.

238
1000
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:21,510
Yes, you may go ahead and ask.

239
1004
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:26,214
I am not a miss,
 I am Jan Di, Geum Jan Di.

240
1009
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:28,751
Yes, Miss Geum Jan Di.

241
1013
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,090
Right now, 
why am I here?

242
1018
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,726
I also do not know the reason, Miss.

243
1022
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:40,262
Where are we going right now?

244
1026
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:42,531
We are almost there now.

245
1030
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:44,666
He's waiting for you.

246
1034
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:49,405
Waiting? Who?

247
1038
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:37,386
(Ji Hoo sunbae?)

248
1042
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:48,964
You?! 
Why in the world are you here?!

249
1047
00:24:48,964 --> 00:24:50,933
What's so wrong with me being in my house?

250
1051
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:52,735
'My house'?

251
1055
00:24:53,802 --> 00:24:57,006
You mean this mansion is your house?

252
1059
00:24:57,006 --> 00:24:58,574
That's right.

253
1063
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:00,776
Why?!

254
1067
00:25:02,444 --> 00:25:04,546
What are you planning to do?

255
1071
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:08,617
I already did everything.

256
1075
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:18,527
Look at yourself.

257
1079
00:25:19,628 --> 00:25:22,364
Aren't you surprised?

258
1083
00:25:23,632 --> 00:25:30,038
The Ugly Duckling can transform into
an egret by spending a little money.

259
1088
00:25:30,706 --> 00:25:33,275
Wasn't it a swan?

260
1092
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:35,611
That doesn't matter.

261
1096
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:41,016
What in the world are you doing?
I didn't ask for anything like this.

262
1101
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:45,554
Hey commoner, just say the truth,
and tell me that you like me.

263
1106
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:51,192
Oh, you're the style that says the opposite, right?

264
1110
00:25:51,192 --> 00:25:53,896
Goo Joon Pyo, 
there's a limit to your playing.

265
1115
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:58,700
This is illegal kidnapping and confinement.
It's a serious crime, don't you know that?

266
1120
00:25:59,602 --> 00:26:04,072
Since there's is no one here, you
can just tell me that you like me.

267
1125
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,245
From now on, if outside of school,
I'll allow you to say hello to me.

268
1130
00:26:10,245 --> 00:26:15,350
What? 
Are you suprised by such an incredible offer?

269
1135
00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:18,253
Do you want me to say it again?

270
1139
00:26:18,253 --> 00:26:26,829
From now on, you can talk to Goo Joon Pyo 
when nobody is there.

271
1144
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:33,201
Understand?

272
1148
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:35,470
You've gone crazy, right?

273
1152
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:38,173
You did go crazy, huh?

274
1156
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:43,712
You, because you ate so much greasy
food, is your brain not working?

275
1161
00:26:43,712 --> 00:26:46,916
Who's surprised by what?

276
1165
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:50,319
Forget about it.
 I want to go.

277
1170
00:26:53,756 --> 00:26:56,358
Isn't it you whose brain isn't working?

278
1174
00:26:56,358 --> 00:26:58,994
You'd better move.

279
1178
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:03,599
Do you know how much was done to you from
your head to your toes?

280
1183
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:06,602
$100,000

281
1187
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:10,005
What? 
$100,000?!

282
1192
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,040
That's right.

283
1196
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,544
But that, it's nothing.

284
1200
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:18,780
If you were with me, you could enjoy much more than that every day.

285
1204
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,551
Do you mean to tell me you don't want that? 
Maybe you're the one who's crazy.

286
1209
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:25,587
I'm only here because I was dragged here by a psycho,

287
1213
00:27:25,587 --> 00:27:28,523
You think I'm in the right state of mind?

288
1217
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:35,030
The moment I saw your face, I feel like bugs are crawling all over my body.

289
1221
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,782
Bring my school uniform right NOW!

290
1225
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:13,035
What is this?! Aishhhh!

291
1229
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:25,914
Go throw it away!

292
1233
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:31,920
What are you doing?! Did you not hear
me tell you to throw it away?!

293
1238
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,322
Yes, young master.

294
1242
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:34,623
And fire them all.

295
1246
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:35,324
What?

296
1250
00:28:35,324 --> 00:28:39,127
Fire everyone who served the girl.

297
1254
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:42,764
What was with the hair? 
And the clothes?

298
1259
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:45,399
Was that tacky style the best they could do?

299
1263
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:50,305
Find other ones. 
Go and bring the best ones.

300
1268
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:54,309
Those who worked today were the best staff.

301
1272
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:57,879
Then you can just find more expensive ones.

302
1276
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:01,817
Yes, of course.

303
1280
00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:22,437
Oh my gosh!  What is that?!

304
1284
00:29:22,437 --> 00:29:26,241
Bee! Steward! 
Hurry up and catch it!

305
1289
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:31,113
Ahhh! It's coming towards me! 
Hurry up and get rid of it!

306
1294
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,684
Hurry hurry!

307
1298
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:45,994
Is it gone ?

308
1302
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:50,332
Yes we got rid of it.

309
1306
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:10,502
The tea, did you make it?

310
1310
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:13,639
I'm so sorry 
young master.

311
1315
00:30:17,877 --> 00:30:19,678
Give her the sack.

312
1319
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,792
This bathroom... 
It's bigger than my house.

313
1324
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:22,875
By the way, Geum Jan Di, did the cat
get your tongue at that moment?

314
1329
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:27,512
And also,

315
1333
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:31,082
it seems like you don't know,

316
1337
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:37,756
You don't make friends with money;  you use your heart.

317
1341
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:42,227
There's nothing money can't buy.

318
1345
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:49,134
Speak. 
Tell me if there's something it can't buy.

319
1350
00:31:51,737 --> 00:31:57,776
Can there truly be something money can't buy?

320
1354
00:31:57,776 --> 00:32:04,249
If you have the courage, 
why don't you tell me, 
commoner.

321
1360
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:19,331
Ughh.   How embarrassing!

322
1364
00:32:26,672 --> 00:32:33,111
Ugh! 
I'm crazy!

323
1369
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:00,372
It's you again.

324
1373
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,746
What should I say?

325
1377
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:14,386
Are you going somewhere?

326
1381
00:33:14,386 --> 00:33:15,721
Home

327
1385
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,924
You?

328
1389
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:23,395
I'm going home too.

329
1393
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:26,465
Going like that?

330
1397
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,737
Some kind of problem came up.

331
1401
00:33:33,872 --> 00:33:35,507
What!

332
1405
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:39,611
Whenever I see you, you look so dramatic.

333
1409
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:41,847
That's right, huh?

334
1413
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,790
Can I ask you something?

335
1417
00:33:56,328 --> 00:34:00,432
Is there something money can't buy?

336
1421
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:04,836
Something you can't buy no matter
how much you're willing to spend.

337
1426
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,709
There couldn't be something like that, is there?

338
1430
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:16,013
There couldn't be something like that, right!

339
1434
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:18,383
Air.

340
1438
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:20,018
Huh?

341
1442
00:34:21,954 --> 00:34:26,959
Oh, air.

342
1446
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:34,431
You're right. 
Why didn't I think of that?

343
1451
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:37,536
You're a funny one aren't you.

344
1455
00:34:51,316 --> 00:34:52,784
Wear those home.

345
1459
00:34:52,784 --> 00:34:57,122
If you walk around like that in this neighborhood,
you're going to be rounded up by the police.

346
1464
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:32,951
Who's this?

347
1468
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:36,555
Aren't you Miss Wonder Woman who's the natural enemy of Goo Joon Pyo?

348
1472
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:39,324
What brings you here? 
Joon Pyo's not here right now, though.

349
1477
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:42,227
Who said I wanted to see that bastard!

350
1481
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:48,867
Aren't those...  Ji Hoo's shoes?

351
1485
00:36:54,773 --> 00:36:57,142
Please give this to him for me.

352
1489
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:01,746
Wait a minute.

353
1493
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:06,051
Why don't you drink some tea before you go?

354
1497
00:37:12,157 --> 00:37:14,726
Is that really what you told Joon Pyo?


355
1502
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:18,530
Woah, you're really something.

356
1506
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,767
No one has pissed him off like that before.

357
1510
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:25,670
Oh, it's Seo Hyun.

358
1514
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,306
Shouldn't she be coming back soon?

359
1518
00:37:29,306 --> 00:37:32,744
Ji Hoo must be happy.

360
1522
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,858
Ummm...

361
1526
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:50,495
Have you guys known each other for a while?

362
1530
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:53,765
Yes, 
since kindergarten.

363
1535
00:37:53,765 --> 00:37:56,368
I see.

364
1539
00:37:57,436 --> 00:38:01,873
You... 
seem to be curious about something.

365
1544
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:06,311
Just ask. As long as we know
the answer, we'll tell you in return.

366
1549
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:07,579
In return?

367
1553
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:11,349
We've been pretty entertained these days thanks to you.

368
1557
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:24,730
Uhmm, do Ji Hoo Sunbae (senior) and
the model Min Seo Hyun know each other?

369
1562
00:38:25,864 --> 00:38:28,500
Know each other?

370
1566
00:38:37,676 --> 00:38:40,512
He was in a traffic accident when he was 5 years old.

371
1570
00:38:40,512 --> 00:38:44,683
His parents died at the scene and only he survived.

372
1574
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:48,386
After that, he started to display symptoms of autism
and he didn't get along with anyone.

373
1579
00:38:48,386 --> 00:38:52,257
The person that helped him out of his shell was Min Seo Hyun..

374
1583
00:38:52,257 --> 00:38:55,594
For us, she's like a big sister and good friend,

375
1587
00:38:55,594 --> 00:39:01,633
but for Ji Hoo, she's like his first love, 
his lover, like a mother.

376
1592
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:20,352
So pretty... How could she look like that?

377
1596
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:23,888
It must be so nice to give birth to a daughter like her.

378
1600
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:26,792
Even from a woman's perspective, 
she is so pretty and cool.

379
1605
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:30,128
Min Seo Hyun. Mom, 
that woman's Min Seo Hyun, right?

380
1610
00:39:32,731 --> 00:39:35,700
Eh, 
God is so unfair...

381
1615
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,304
To give someone a face, 
a brain and even a family...

382
1620
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:42,840
All to someone else.

383
1624
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,711
What do you mean? 
He gave us such wide square shoulders!

384
1629
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:52,884
Finished eating?

385
1633
00:39:56,555 --> 00:40:00,811
The pressure of "The Daughter Of Mom's Friend"
is enough to spoil her appetite.

386
1638
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:06,250
That's right, you have eyes, why
would you want to go on a diet?

387
1643
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,621
But is that woman going to be a lawyer or a model?

388
1647
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:11,723
Of course she should be a lawyer!


389
1652
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:13,458
She passed that hard exam.

390
1656
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:15,493
I like her as a model better though.

391
1660
00:40:15,493 --> 00:40:18,796
That's why men are simple.

392
1664
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:23,501
When she's young, she's a model.
but when she's older, she'll be a lawyer.

393
1669
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:26,037
That's my mother! (Kang San is implying that she's smart.)

394
1673
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:33,111
Jan Di, you're not eating any mandarins, right?

395
1677
00:40:34,178 --> 00:40:36,214
Hey! She's going to take some for lunch.

396
1681
00:40:36,214 --> 00:40:39,283
Dad, 
what's this?

397
1686
00:40:40,752 --> 00:40:41,819
What is this?

398
1690
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:43,788
No! 
It's not-

399
1695
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:47,091
What is this? 5,000 won ($5) on thunder bird (racehorse)

400
1699
00:40:48,026 --> 00:40:53,164
Typhoon, 20,000 won ($20).
Jil Chu, 30,000 won ($30). Why you-

401
1704
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:54,699
I am actually going to win this time.

402
1708
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:58,102
Get out! 
Just take this and live together with them!

403
1713
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:03,774
I won't trust a word you say again or,
my name is Thunderbird! Get out!

404
1718
00:41:03,774 --> 00:41:08,780
Mom, Thunderbird came in last, last.  
Pick something else.

1829

What a state.

432
1833
00:43:30,188 --> 00:43:34,225
Looks good. 
Good job.

433
1838
00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:37,094
It's a double nosebleed!

434
1842
00:43:45,236 --> 00:43:47,505
Look at her!

435
1846
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:50,975
Good job!

436
1850

Hold still.

437
1854

How badly were you spacing out that you
were stupid enough to have a ball hit your face?

438
1859
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:53,170
Stop it.

439
1863
00:44:54,605 --> 00:44:56,107
What?

440
1867
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:59,743
Stop crying.

441
1871
00:44:59,743 --> 00:45:01,612
It doesn't suit you.

442
1875
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:06,317
Mind your own business. 
Now I have to get your permission to cry?

443
1880
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:12,490
And aren't you the happiest person
whenever I'm crying or sad?

444
1885
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:18,796
Is that the way you talk to someone
 who ran over here to help you?

445
1890
00:45:18,796 --> 00:45:23,334
Who asked you to?
 I said, WHO ASKED YOU TO?

446
1895
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:27,972
Even if you were the last person on earth,
I wouldn't ask you for help!

447
1900
00:45:28,873 --> 00:45:32,943
I'd rather die of a nosebleed than ask for your help!

448
1904
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:41,585
Hey!

449
1908
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:51,729
What do you dislike so much about me? Huh?

450
1912
00:45:52,430 --> 00:46:03,374
I'm good looking, tall, smart, rich. What is there- What is there not to like about Goo Joon Pyo? 
Are you a real idiot?

451
1917
00:46:03,374 --> 00:46:08,178
You must not realize it, but your entire personality is unattractive!

452
1921
00:46:08,178 --> 00:46:13,784
That greasy mouth, your arrogant walk, and
your curly hair... It's all very annoying.

453
1926
00:46:14,685 --> 00:46:15,886
Are you on drugs?

454
1930
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:18,155
I'm not done yet.

455
1934
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:20,658
It annoys me that you guys are the only
ones that don't wear a school uniform,

456
1939
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:26,697
There's the  Red Card deal, where you bully the weak people and just giggle about it like it's nothing. That's the worst!

457
1943
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:28,265
Ha! You...

458
1947
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:30,100
Want me to repeat myself one more time?

459
1951
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:36,040
I said, I hate everything about Goo Joon Pyo. 
 I HATE IT ALL!!!

460
1956
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,400
Geez!

461
1960
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:04,661
(Shin Hwa High School - school trip notice)

462
1964
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:10,334
(Visiting 5 Northern European Countries,
including Scandinavia)

463
1969
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:14,538
So... 
a school trip...

464
1974
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:21,311
What? 20,000,000 won (about $20,000)!

465
1978
00:48:21,311 --> 00:48:25,883
That's unbelievable. 
A school trip is 20,000,000 won?

466
1983
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:27,718
You mean the entire school goes?

467
1987
00:48:27,718 --> 00:48:29,953
No, 
not  me.

468
1992
00:48:29,953 --> 00:48:31,789
You two are trying to go somewhere with out me, huh?

469
1996
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:33,490
Go? 
Where would we go?

470
2001
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,459
So, what are you going to do?

471
2005
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:40,797
I don't know. I'll have to slack off at school
for a month and find a part-time job.

472
2010
00:48:40,797 --> 00:48:44,835
Ugh!  My dad, 
MY DAD! He screwed up again!

473
2015
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:47,871
My home is like a black hole.

474
2019
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,608
South, you guys are going down south!

475
2023
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:54,044
Stop talking about the south!
Hurry up and go make the porridge!

476
2028
00:48:54,044 --> 00:48:59,716
We're also begging our school to send us on a
trip rather than going to the English Village.

477
2033
00:48:59,716 --> 00:49:02,586
Isn't there some place we can go to
play and work at the same time?

478
2038
00:49:05,423 --> 00:49:08,425
Aish! 
The south side beach should be right!

479
2043
00:49:09,426 --> 00:49:12,129
Yeah mom. Really?

480
2047
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:17,735
Yes I can go, but can Jan Di come too?

481
2051
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:22,640
Really?  
You're going to tell Auntie, right?

482
2056
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,777
But you have to guarantee us at
least 70,000 won($70) per person.

483
2061
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:34,918
Awww...See? I was right 
you guys are going somewhere.

484
2066
00:49:34,918 --> 00:49:37,121
South? right? 
You guys are going south?

485
2071
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,996
Will you quit that? 
It's stressing me out.

486
2076
00:49:48,432 --> 00:49:49,767
Doesn't Joon Pyo Sunbae look hot?

487
2080
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:52,002
He looks even hotter today!

488
2084
00:49:52,002 --> 00:49:55,806
Goo Joon Pyo! 
Are you waiting for someone too?

489
2089
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:59,829
Waiting? No way. The trip is going to be long
so I'm pacing before we board the plane.

490
2094
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:05,337
Hey, why did you say you were coming with us this time?

491
2098
00:50:05,337 --> 00:50:07,840
Didn't you say last time that it was too bothersome so you wouldn't go
 unless it was on one of your private planes?

492
2103
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:13,045
It's high school. This kind of hardship is going
to be part of our high school memory too.

493
2108
00:50:13,045 --> 00:50:14,613
Isn't that right,  Ji Hoo?

494
2112
00:50:14,613 --> 00:50:16,081
What?

495
2116
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:19,117
Yo yo yo! Let's go.

496
2120
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:29,261
Ugh! Why isn't she here yet?

497
2124
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,822
Woah, isn't that Min Seo Hyun?

498
2128
00:50:56,822 --> 00:51:00,525
Wow, she's so fine! This is killer!

499
2132
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:02,928
Take a photo!

500
2136
00:51:02,928 --> 00:51:05,364
Woah.

501
2140
00:51:05,364 --> 00:51:06,531
Her face is so pretty.

502
2144
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:08,700
Her skin too.

503
2148
00:51:29,054 --> 00:51:33,124
Ohhh! It's Min Seo Hyun! You're so pretty!

504
2152
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:37,296
Can we get an autograph?

505
2156
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:54,780
Thank you very much!

506
2160
00:52:02,755 --> 00:52:03,689
Have you been well?

507
2164
00:52:03,689 --> 00:52:04,356
Yeah.

508
2168
00:52:04,356 --> 00:52:05,457
Let's go.

509
2172
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:11,263
I don't like those photos.

510
2176
00:52:40,893 --> 00:52:42,627
Hello?

511
2180
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:49,334
Sir, I'm sorry, but cellphones are not
permitted when about to take off.

512
2185
00:52:51,236 --> 00:52:56,475
W-what? W-where did she go?

513
2189
00:52:56,475 --> 00:52:59,878
(singing) Should we go to the ocean to catch fish?

514
2193
00:52:59,878 --> 00:53:03,515
Shall we go to the mountain to catch some fish?

515
2197
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:08,287
Fill up our bucket . . .

516
2201
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:09,888
Isn't it,  "put it in"?

517
2205
00:53:09,888 --> 00:53:11,390
isn't it "fill it up"?

518
2209
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:35,847
Hey, Laundry girl!

519
2213
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:40,919
Ah ah! Do you hear, commoner?

520
2217
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:47,926
What was that?

521
2221
00:53:47,926 --> 00:53:51,029
Ga Eul,  am I dreaming right now?

522
2225
00:53:51,029 --> 00:53:53,865
I don't think so.

523
2229
00:53:53,865 --> 00:53:59,638
But I keep hearing that annoying guy's  voice.

524
2233
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:07,345
W-what!

525
2237
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:23,461
I heard the commoner went to the ocean...

526
2241
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:25,897
but look at the state of that boat.

527
2245
00:54:25,897 --> 00:54:29,468
Hey! What the heck are you doing here!

528
2249
00:54:29,468 --> 00:54:33,805
Weren't you supposed to go to
Scandavy or Scadvia whatever it is!

529
2254
00:54:33,805 --> 00:54:38,676
It's not like it's going to be our first
time there, I'm sick of it, you know?

530
2259
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:45,049
I told them to go find somewhere
original, and they suggested this place.

531
2264
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:51,056
Isn't this a coincidence! I really didn't know you were here.

532
2268
00:54:51,056 --> 00:54:56,561
Why not just go on your own path.
I'd be thankful if you just ignored me.

533
2273
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:59,731
Do you think you'll be alright on that boat or raft thing?

534
2277
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:04,636
It IS a boat even if it's small! Just do whatever you're doing!

535
2281
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:11,776
Is that so?  Well, even if it is overturned, I'm sure
you won't die or anything.  You can swim, can't you?

536
2286
00:55:13,412 --> 00:55:15,413
Then, let's go!

537
2290
00:55:29,127 --> 00:55:32,531
You jerk!

538
2294
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,202
Goo JoonPyo!

539
2298
00:56:10,736 --> 00:56:13,872
Lll-look!  Isn't that Min Seo Hyun?

540
2302
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:20,345
W-w-w . . . .

541
2306
00:56:45,604 --> 00:56:47,105
Hey, Laundry girl.

542
2310
00:56:47,105 --> 00:56:48,974
WHAT NOW?!

543
2314
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:53,077
Honestly, you're actually glad to see me here, aren't you?

544
2318
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:56,581
Say it, you were bored like hell in this
stinky hole before I came, right?

545
2323
00:56:56,581 --> 00:57:00,852
Before I met you, I was very happy, okay?

546
2327
00:57:00,852 --> 00:57:06,591
Well, since you go to our school, you can come.

547
2331
00:57:07,726 --> 00:57:12,096
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I have no intentions of going!

548
2336
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,366
Ei Shoot!

549
2340
00:57:24,943 --> 00:57:32,617
There's going to be a welcoming party for her.
It should be fun. You should come. You're coming, right?

550
2345
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:37,122
Okay I'll go. I'll go for sure!

551
2349
00:57:39,324 --> 00:57:42,427
Wait!  Hey, you!

552
2353
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:51,836
I know what you girls are going to say.
I don't want to go either, okay?

553
2358
00:57:51,836 --> 00:58:00,043
Come on! Ji Hoo Sunbae and Joon Pyo Sunbae
both invited you. You have  to come.

554
2363
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:02,046
Don't you?

555
2367
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:03,482
Uh, yeah.

556
2371
00:58:03,482 --> 00:58:07,319
It's just that the guys forgot to tell you something.

557
2375
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:10,087
Forgot to tell me something?

558
2379
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:14,059
W-w-w-what are you doing!

559
2383
00:58:14,059 --> 00:58:15,360
Let's go.

560
2387
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:47,659
Is this really okay?

561
2391
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:52,964
It's going to be fine. Once you step in there, other people will probably be wearing stuff that's more outrageous.

562
2395
00:58:52,964 --> 00:58:55,867
This is nothing.

563
2399
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:58,903
That's not it... its so embarassing.

564
2403
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:03,074
What is? It's not easy to get the
concept down so perfectly, like you.

565
2408
00:59:03,074 --> 00:59:06,611
Don't worry. Geum Jan Di, fighting!

566
2412
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:09,981
I'm just going to leave.

567
2416
00:59:09,981 --> 00:59:13,852
Oh, no. A faint heart never wins fair lady.

568
2420
01:00:49,174 --> 01:00:55,013
Jin Seon Mi or that whatever. Just let me catch you.

569
2424
01:00:55,013 --> 01:01:04,356
But... what an idiot... I should know what to believe. How can I believe that? I'm such an idiot.

570
2428
01:01:09,895 --> 01:01:12,698
Geum Jan Di!

571
2432
01:01:16,235 --> 01:01:17,169
You guys...

572
2436
01:01:17,169 --> 01:01:22,541
Hello, I've been looking for you for so long.

573
2440
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:24,643
Why won't you take off your coat?

574
2444
01:01:24,643 --> 01:01:26,879
Aren't you a bit hot?

575
2448
01:01:26,879 --> 01:01:30,749
I'm not hot!!  Because of the ocean winds, I'm really cold.

576
2452
01:01:30,749 --> 01:01:35,153
Oh is that right? Isn't your dress a little to thin?

577
2456
01:01:35,153 --> 01:01:41,393
Lately, the new luxury items are pretty, but show
a bit too much skin. Maybe yours is like that?

578
2461
01:01:41,393 --> 01:01:42,761
Hurry up and take it off!

579
2465
01:01:42,761 --> 01:01:45,030
Why won't we just take it off for her?

580
2469
01:02:06,686 --> 01:02:10,656
What is this? Isn't that Wonder Woman?

581
2473
01:02:10,656 --> 01:02:15,494
Can you not tell fantasy from reality?
 Just because there are some internet articles about wonder girl
 now she thinks she wonder woman or something?

582
2479
01:02:15,494 --> 01:02:17,930
If you didn't have a dress, you should've just said so.

583
2483
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:23,402
I know you want to stick out, but this
isn't the way to do it, you commoner.

584
2488
01:02:23,402 --> 01:02:27,573
So is this how commoners have fun these days?

585
2492
01:02:30,342 --> 01:02:32,578
Oh, my god, Wonder Woman?

586
2496
01:03:04,643 --> 01:03:07,545
I know why you kids are like this,

587
2500
01:03:07,545 --> 01:03:09,714
but, do you know what?

588
2504
01:03:09,714 --> 01:03:15,053
All you've proven is that you are the ones, not this girl,
that are low class.

589
2509
01:03:16,288 --> 01:03:19,725
What are you doing Ji Hoo?  Take her to my room.

590
2513
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,176
Ji Hoo, why is he doing something he's never done before?

591
2517
01:03:38,176 --> 01:03:42,147
I don't know what it is, but isn't it a very interesting turn of events?

592
2521
01:04:25,658 --> 01:04:30,428
Thank you. You didn't have to do all this for me.

593
2525
01:04:30,428 --> 01:04:34,199
It's my pleasure. It's no inconvenience at all.

594
2529
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:38,036
I shouldn't have even come here.

595
2533
01:04:38,036 --> 01:04:40,672
Ji Hoo invited you, right..?

596
2537
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:44,876
If you're Ji Hoo's friend, you're an important friend to me,as well.

597
2541
01:04:46,378 --> 01:04:50,982
No.. he only invited me out of politeness.

598
2545
01:04:51,783 --> 01:04:56,054
No.. Ji Hoo is not that kind of child.

599
2549
01:04:56,054 --> 01:05:00,892
And I've never seen him treat anyone else like that.

600
2553
01:05:03,462 --> 01:05:06,832
Ji Hoo Sunbae  is ordinarily caring.

601
2557
01:05:06,832 --> 01:05:09,668
Ji Hoo is caring..?

602
2561
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:17,242
Don't you see? It's because Jan Di is a special girl.

603
2565
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:22,080
I've heard all the hardships you went
through because of Joon Pyo.

604
2570
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,118
You said you certainly wouldn't lose, right?

605
2574
01:05:26,118 --> 01:05:28,920
That is...

606
2578
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,023
It's because he's lonely.

607
2582
01:05:32,023 --> 01:05:33,525
Pardon?

608
2586
01:05:33,525 --> 01:05:38,830
He's hiding his loneliness through bullying others, that rascal...

609
2590
01:05:39,798 --> 01:05:44,669
Goo Joon Pyo is lonely?  No way!!

610
2594
01:05:46,672 --> 01:05:50,842
He may only see his parents once every year.

611
2598
01:05:50,842 --> 01:06:01,619
From the moment he was born, he was never treated as a friend or a son. He was always surrounded by people that only saw him as the heir of a plutocrat company.

612
2602
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:04,422
Can you imagine living like that?

613
2606
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,162
Don't lose, okay?

614
2610
01:06:11,797 --> 01:06:12,965
Pardon?

615
2614
01:06:12,965 --> 01:06:17,435
I like you, so I'll support you!!

616
2618
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,776
Okay, we're done.

617
2622
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:26,478
Stand up..

618
2626
01:06:53,939 --> 01:06:56,341
They're so pretty.

619
2630
01:06:56,341 --> 01:07:00,712
Shoes are the most important thing for a woman.

620
2634
01:07:01,346 --> 01:07:03,381
Why is that?

621
2638
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:10,121
Good shoes will take you to good places.

622
2642
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:17,829
Okay, it's all done!

623
2646
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:20,031
Shall we go?

624
2650
01:08:11,283 --> 01:08:16,988
A gentleman should never leave a pretty lady by herself.
