00:02:05,077 --> 00:02:08,813
Goo..Goo Joon Pyo!

2
7
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:17,556
Hey! Hey! Wait ....Goo Joon Pyo!!!

3
11
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:33,906
Hey!

4
15
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:37,009
You!

5
19
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:38,711
How did you . . .?

6
23
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,200
Let's talk, Goo Joon Pyo!

7
27
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:48,788
I don't have anything to say to you. 
 And you, I thought I told you to act like you don't know me..

8
32
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:50,123
Well, I have something to say

9
36
00:02:50,123 --> 00:02:51,157
Well I don't!

10
40
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:53,125
Well I do!

11
44
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,427
Hey!

12
48
00:02:54,427 --> 00:02:56,161
Stop following me!

13
52
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:59,232
- Don't run after me. 
 I have something to say.

14
57
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:05,438
Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo!

15
61
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:08,407
Go away you leech!

16
65
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:12,746
Goo Joon Pyo! I have something to tell you!!

17
69
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:26,393
Hey! Goo Joon Pyo! Stop right there! Goo Joon Pyo!!

18
73
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,698
Get in!

19
77
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:36,335
- Huh?
- Hurry get on! You want to catch up with him, right?

20
82
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:37,270
Yes.

21
86
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:46,666
Do you want to die!?

22
90
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:06,119
Stop, stop it already!

23
94
00:06:09,455 --> 00:06:14,060
You haven't learned your lesson? 
 Who taught you to treat a lady in such manner?

24
99
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,829
Geez, stop it noona, you don't even know what's going on.

25
103
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:18,932
Noona?

26
107
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:30,609
I'm sorry. For having a brother like this. I'll apologize instead.

27
111
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:35,580
Come to my house, you can tell me all about it there. Is that ok?

28
115
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,618
- I....
 - No! She's banned from entering my home!

29
120
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:41,654
Do YOU want to get banned from going out ?

30
124
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,594
Let's go!

31
128
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:59,204
I'm telling you, she can't come in!

32
132
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:00,940
Follow me, carefully.

33
136
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:31,336
Help yourselves.

34
140
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:33,439
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

35
144
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:42,181
Young Master said that he doesn't want to eat.

36
148
00:07:42,181 --> 00:07:44,551
He won't die from skipping one meal.

37
152
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:55,761
So, you mean that little kid with the hunger strike has declared a childish war?  And you guys agreed?

38
156
00:07:55,761 --> 00:08:03,633
No, I'm against it.  I don't want to watch F4 being separated like this.

39
160
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:06,039
Me either.  I don't mind, but...

40
164
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,443
Okay.
 So it's been decided then.

41
169
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:11,610
- Butler Leeï¼Ÿ
Yes, Young Mistress?

42
174
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,885
Can you bring out the delicacies that i brought from abroad?

43
178
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:19,285
Ah, don't forget to fetch a bottle of Cristal (champagne) as well.

44
182
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:22,188
Yes, miss. I understand. I'll go get it ready.

45
186
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:30,930
Jan Di, you'll have to eat more than that.  If you want to fight with that fool, you need to store up your energy.

46
190
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:39,205
Now, let's drink to the foolish Young Master upstairs. 
Cheers!

47
195
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:57,957
Thank you so much for today.

48
199
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:01,626
I'll accept that thanks later.

49
203
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:05,263
But, I . . .

50
207
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:10,901
- You've done so much for me . . .
- Why would I go through all the trouble?

51
212
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:13,906
Have you met my mother?

52
216
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:16,341
Yes.

53
220
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:22,881
For rich people, meeting a true friend is as hard as getting into heaven.

54
224
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:29,487
My mom doesn't think friends are necessary.

55
228
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:30,656
Why is that?

56
232
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:35,461
As for my mother, she believes that Shin Hwa Group's heir cannot have friends

57
236
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:38,830
and shouldn't become friends with others.

58
240
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,968
But, Goo Joon Pyo has F4,

59
244
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:48,374
Yeah, as a billionaire's son for Joon Pyo

60
248
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:53,011
to have friends like F4 is like a miracle.

61
252
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:57,349
I'm sorry.

62
256
00:09:57,349 --> 00:10:00,452
Because of me, one of his friends . . .

63
260
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:05,257
I won't let him lose his friends.

64
264
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:08,894
And, on the other hand, I'm rather grateful to you.

65
268
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:10,329
Huh?

66
272
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:15,867
Because of you, he's been able to open his heart more.

67
276
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:22,640
If friendship is mandatory, love is a necessity.

68
280
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,181
Get ready, the battle starts tomorrow!!

69
284
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:47,631
- Goodbye
-Bye!

70
289
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:48,935
Let's go.

71
293
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:05,618
I'm so hungry. I haven't had anything to eat.

72
297
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:11,657
Crazy butler! 
 So he's not even going to bring me a snack, huh?

73
302
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:14,961
Ah! Seriously...

74
306
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,260
Are you really going to do this to me?

75
310
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:32,101
I'm sorry. 
Hurry and go back.

76
315
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:41,143
Ah! I'm so hungry though!

77
319
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,486
<i>Let's talk 
- Ji Hoo</i>

78
324
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:35,497
This movie . . .
Do you remember how many times we have watched it?

79
329
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:40,102
Hmm... about ten times?

80
333
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:45,274
Sorry.

81
337
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:51,948
I know everything is not going to be ok with just an apology.

82
341
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:56,350
But... 
But?

83
346
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,986
Let Jan Di go.

84
350
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:07,029
If I don't, then what will you do? 
I'll protect her.

85
355
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,937
I will have to protect her.

86
359
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,578
11 times....

87
363
00:13:24,578 --> 00:13:30,516
If you remembered that I was the friend you watched this movie with 11 times,

88
367
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:33,989
none of this would've ever happened.

89
371
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,727
Get ready.

90
375
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,945
Oh, my god! Joon Hee sunbae!

91
379
00:13:56,945 --> 00:13:59,581
Unniiiiiiii

92
383
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:02,384
Joon Hee sunbae!
 It's Joon Hee sunbae!

93
388
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:10,424
Are you going to kick them out of school?....or
  Or?

94
393
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,795
Should I have you, Mr. Principal, fired first?

95
397
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:16,565
Stop this right now!

96
401
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:25,208
It seems you're still out of your mind.

97
405
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:29,378
Why in the world did you even come to school?

98
409
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:37,285
What? You want to dare fire the principal? 
 Fine! Do it! 
Then I'll be the next principal, how do you like that, huh?

99
415
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:39,587
Do you think you'll be able to graduate easily with me here?

100
419
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,889
Don't even joke like that!

101
423
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:48,597
Dear brother, you and I are too alike, 
 when have we ever been known to joke around?

102
428
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,201
Be quiet and follow me!

103
432
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:58,373
Noona, noona!

104
436
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,044
You guys too, follow me.

105
440
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:04,279
Let me go! Noona! noona! noona!

106
444
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:14,856
Who is that?

107
448
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:18,293
Shin Hwa Group's Goo Joon Hee sunbae, right?

108
452
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:28,236
Oh my!  She's the legendary Charisma Queen.

109
456
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:32,974
I can feel her aura, wow.

110
460
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:41,616
She's already married to the owner of the best hotel in the world. 
 She's my idol!

111
465
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:45,486
Do you know the type of guys I hate the most?

112
469
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:50,225
Selfish guys, narrow minded guys, and unforgiving guys.

113
473
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:54,061
And what type of guy unfairly flaunts his power?

114
477
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:55,563
A selfish guy.

115
481
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:59,366
How about a guy who's unable to forgive a friend for a past mistake?

116
485
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:00,702
A narrow minded guy.

117
489
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:04,071
And a guy who can't accept the consequences for his actions?

118
493
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:07,007
An unforgiving guy.

119
497
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:16,083
Ok, then. Joon Pyo and Ji Hoo. 
 Play a game together and accept the consequences no matter what.

120
502
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:21,622
What are we, kids? No,
 I don't agree.

121
507
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:26,894
I agree!  Definitely... I agree.

122
511
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:31,932
I approve too.

123
515
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:34,102
Thank you, Noona..

124
519
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:39,007
I approve too.

125
523
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:41,743
What the heck, who said you guys have the right to vote?

126
527
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:44,379
Stop it, it doesn't make any sense!

127
531
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:48,649
5 vs 1. 
Decision passed.

128
536
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:50,686
No way!

129
540
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:58,794
Then, I get to decide the game with compete in.

130
544
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:03,497
That's against fair play.

131
548
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:06,668
Don't worry.  I have everything already ready. 
 Bring it in, please.

132
553
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:28,756
A different sport activity has been placed inside each ball.

133
557
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,527
And they include sports that you've played, and some that you haven't.

134
561
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:35,964
What the heck?  
Choose the ones we've played before.

135
566
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:46,308
For the sake of fairness, we will randomly choose the balls. 
 People say "being lucky also requires skill".

136
571
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:51,112
Is there going to be just one game?

137
575
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:55,950
I was thinking whoever wins 2 games out of 3. 
 What do you think?

138
580
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,220
I'll do it.

139
584
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:04,226
Fine, I'll do it.

140
588
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:11,966
The sport that is going to be used will be announced 2 days before the game.

141
592
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:17,772
Even if you are not good at that sport, you still need to agree to the result.

142
596
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:18,907
Okay?

143
600
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,112
The 3 related to the incident in question, please come forward.

144
604
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,905
Related to the incident? 
Me?

145
609
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:52,941
ME?

146
613
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,655
Let's start then.

147
617
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,591
Jan Di, you press.

148
621
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,407
Ji Hoo.

149
625
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:34,182
Joon Pyo.

150
629
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,408
Horse racing?

151
633
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,612
- Yes, that's right. 
 - Who's better at it?

152
638
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:05,614
Ji Hoo sunbae.

153
642
00:20:05,614 --> 00:20:07,682
That's good!

154
646
00:20:07,682 --> 00:20:11,385
At least,  the chances of him winning have increased!

155
650
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:18,325
Ga Eul. I'm telling you. 
The theory of the universe is not that simple.

156
655
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:23,532
So have you received any signals?
Who do 'they' think will win?

157
660
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:30,806
They are saying that the probability is...

158
664
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:31,939
The probability is?

159
668
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:36,378
...is half and half.

160
672
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:40,348
God! Who didn't know that already!?

161
676
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:42,851
You're no help!

162
680
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:35,269
Young master! 
Young master!

163
685
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:36,238
Are you alright?

164
689
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:42,910
You're being too hard on yourself. 
 Why don't you pick another horse?

165
694
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,312
No.

166
698
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:48,316
I need that horse.

167
702
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:50,719
Hey, you!

168
706
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,480
Yes, young master.

169
710
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,015
Tell me honestly,

170
714
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:56,885
do you think I can win against Ji Hoo?

171
718
00:22:00,322 --> 00:22:03,392
Never mind, I'm going to win tomorrow, no matter what.

172
722
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:19,474
Are you sure you wouldn't like to ride it first?

173
726
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:23,178
I'm choosing this horse because it is such an important race.

174
730
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,387
Please take good care of him...

175
734
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:33,991
Young master...

176
738
00:22:37,326 --> 00:22:41,562
this race, do you really have to do it?

177
742
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:43,532
If I could avoid it, I would want to do that as well.

178
746
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:47,803
I didn't raise these horses so that you young masters could use them to fight with each other.

179
750
00:22:47,803 --> 00:22:50,139
Sorry.

180
754
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:26,875
Oh! Horse!
H.. h.. horse!!

181
759
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,955
Ready... Go!

182
763
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:46,248
<i> 	*Warning - cliff* 
 You are being too harsh. If you keep running it will be critical for the horse.</i>

183
768
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:07,736
Let's go!

184
772
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:11,873
Please go!

185
776
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:35,974
Umm, how what's their battle record?

186
780
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:39,300
Maybe about,  49 wins and 1 tie?

187
784
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:44,773
Which side? 
 No one can beat Ji Hoo in horse racing. Even among us, no one...

188
789
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:49,311
Heh, we're saved.

189
793
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:55,052
Hey, there.

190
797
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:57,419
Hey, it's Goo Joon Pyo sunbae!

191
801
00:27:12,668 --> 00:27:16,938
Wow, it's amazing! 
 What happened?

192
806
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:18,609
Oh, no!

193
810
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:52,807
Wanna touch it?

194
814
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:54,442
Can I?

195
818
00:27:59,815 --> 00:28:04,386
His name is Rui.
Hello Rui!

196
823
00:28:04,386 --> 00:28:06,388
I'm Geum Jan Di.

197
827
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:17,064
Rui, it's been hard on you right? 
It's alright.

198
832
00:28:17,064 --> 00:28:18,266
Thank you!

199
836
00:28:29,144 --> 00:28:31,847
What? 
Really?

200
841
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:35,438
He wants you to ride on him.

201
845
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:40,789
Is that alright? 
I'm heavy.

202
850
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:35,341
This horse will not be able to race again.

203
854
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:40,547
No.  Do something.

204
858
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:43,951
Do something, please!!!

205
862
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:46,221
I'm sorry, young master.

206
866
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:04,104
You might have won the game, but you lost in the race.

207
870
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:08,976
I hope you learned something from today, 
 my dear brother.

208
875
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:13,215
If that's not the case, Jupiter's suffering will have been for nothing.

209
879
00:30:57,324 --> 00:31:00,195
It's time to open Ji Hoo's, right?

210
883
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:51,348
Good morning!

211
887
00:33:54,884 --> 00:33:56,753
What are you guys up to this morning?.

212
891
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:05,562
Butler Lee, the soup is awesome!

213
895
00:34:07,998 --> 00:34:10,166
Joon Pyo, are you really going to do it?

214
899
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:18,841
I didn't pick it.  It was he who picked it. 
 Well, I guess it's his bad luck. 
What was the saying?

215
905
00:34:18,841 --> 00:34:21,077
"Being lucky requires skill".

216
909
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:23,346
That's it! That!

217
913
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:26,483
Ji Hoo, that punk, I don't think he'll be able to do it.

218
917
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:33,323
Well, he really doesn't need to force himself. 
 If he forfeits, then it's automatically...  what was that word ?

219
922
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:34,858
A win by default.

220
926
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:37,293

Yes, that's right, a win by default.

221
931
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:41,765
Then, I would have 2 wins. 
 So no need for another competition.

222
936
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:48,538
I knew this was what's going to happen.

223
940
00:34:48,538 --> 00:34:54,109
YingGuaEungBo(What goes around comes around)
SaPalGuiJung(supposed to be SaPilGuiJung)

224
945
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:55,945
What the heck is he saying?

225
949
00:34:55,945 --> 00:35:01,349
YingGuaEungBo(What goes around comes around)
SaPilGuiJung(Justice will assert itself)

226
954
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,854
My brother, you're that happy, huh?

227
958
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:07,958
- Yup, I'm happy, I'm really excited. 
 - Good for you!

228
963
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:22,706
Noona!!

229
967
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,580
What's so funny?!?

230
971
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,816
Are you laughing?

231
975
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:10,420
I hope you are mentally ready.

232
979
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,521
Ready for what?

233
983
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:13,923
Ji Hoo sunbae absolutely cannot win.

234
987
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:22,731
So the competition is over now.
You, Geum Jan Di, will be kicked out as planned!

235
992
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:25,534
Have you packed your bag yet?

236
996
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:29,821
It's not over yet. 
I believe in Ji Hoo sunbae.

237
1001
00:36:32,475 --> 00:36:37,146
Not too long ago, you were saying that to JoonPyo sunbae.

238
1005
00:36:37,146 --> 00:36:46,455
You low class people, you have no consistency, do you?

239
1009
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:53,430
It gives me goosebumps to think that Ji Hoo sunbae will be hurt because of a girl like you!

240
1013
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,265
What do you mean?

241
1017
00:37:04,273 --> 00:37:07,343
I should tell him not to do this.

242
1021
00:37:07,343 --> 00:37:10,279
Do you think there's another way?

243
1025
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:14,550
Can't you ask his noona for help?

244
1029
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,687
She's already helped me a lot.

245
1033
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:19,989
So you're just going to get kicked out like this?

246
1037
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:24,160
I'd rather get kicked out, then end up breaking Ji Hoo sunbae's heart.

247
1041
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,296
Do you think Ji Hoo sunbae would let you do that?

248
1045
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,205
What is it?

249
1049
00:37:36,205 --> 00:37:39,442
If you can't stop him, you should support him.

250
1053
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:41,244
Hurry up and go.

251
1057
00:37:46,315 --> 00:37:48,451
Thank you, boss!..

252
1061
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:49,586
Geum Jan Di, fighting!

253
1065
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:57,360
Ga Eul, what day is the competition?

254
1069
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,327
Why?

255
1073
00:37:58,327 --> 00:38:05,501
Well, Prince Andromeda should be there too.

256
1077
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:07,837
Ha, ha!  What should I wear that day?

257
1081
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:09,806
Ga Eul, how is my skin?

258
1085
00:38:09,806 --> 00:38:14,644
It's damaged, right? 
 I should go in and take care of it!

259
1090
00:38:18,147 --> 00:38:21,184
He is so pathetic!

260
1094
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,753
What the heck is wrong with him?!

261
1098
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:16,772
There is something I want to ask you.

262
1102
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:17,788
Go ahead.

263
1106
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:25,279
How were you able to get your license?

264
1110
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,749
You heard about it, huh?

265
1114
00:39:31,753 --> 00:39:34,756
Seo Hyun  taught me.

266
1118
00:39:34,756 --> 00:39:41,698
I really didn't want to. 
 But because I didn't want to be embarrassed, I tried my hardest.

267
1123
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:03,352
Please stop now.

268
1127
00:40:03,352 --> 00:40:04,854
Why?

269
1131
00:40:07,397 --> 00:40:10,259
Because all of this is not worth it.

270
1135
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:14,997
It's not like I'm going to that school because I wanted to.

271
1139
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:17,432
It is worth it..

272
1143
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:21,637
I don't know if I will win.

273
1147
00:40:21,637 --> 00:40:26,642
But, I'm going to try my best. 
 I want to.

274
1152
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:36,885
Aren't you going to give that to me?

275
1156
00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:40,623
Oh, right. Do you wanna eat it?

276
1160
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:11,786
It's delicious.

277
1164
00:41:11,786 --> 00:41:13,289
Please have more!

278
1168
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:11,413
Do your job right!

279
1172
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:17,418
What a crappy car!  Do you all want to get fired?!

280
1176
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,032
Yi Jung, are you done with the preparations for your display?

281
1180
00:44:07,032 --> 00:44:09,600
Hmm... yes.

282
1184
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,969
When did you say it was?

283
1188
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:13,905
I think it's... probably going to be next month.

284
1192
00:44:23,314 --> 00:44:25,183
Come on in!

285
1196
00:44:27,853 --> 00:44:31,922
The weather is so nice today, isn't it?

286
1200
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:33,458
Come and take a seat.

287
1204
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:47,806
What do you want to drink?
 We have a special hot cocoa, do you want to try that?

288
1209
00:44:47,906 --> 00:44:48,907
Your friend too?

289
1213
00:44:50,008 --> 00:44:52,444
Don't say no, it's really good.

290
1217
00:44:52,444 --> 00:44:56,814
Butler Lee, can you bring us some hot cocoa?

291
1221
00:44:56,814 --> 00:45:01,218
Help yourself. 
 Have some.

292
1226
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:09,561
Hey buddy.

293
1230
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:16,534
Please I beg you, why don't you just forget about all this?

294
1234
00:45:21,505 --> 00:45:23,708
Be careful.

295
1238
00:45:29,713 --> 00:45:31,849
Stop being so hard on yourself and just drop all of this.

296
1242
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:34,285
Are you worried?

297
1246
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:37,555
Please, be careful.

298
1250
00:45:45,897 --> 00:45:51,102
Excuse me... 
 you know, it's all over if you lose now.

299
1255
00:45:51,102 --> 00:45:57,308
Do you have a strategy... no, something like an ace up your sleeve?

300
1259
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:01,578
You do, right?

301
1263
00:46:01,578 --> 00:46:06,451
You should. 
An ace?

302
1268
00:46:14,192 --> 00:46:16,060
I do.

303
1272
00:46:32,343 --> 00:46:33,711
Don't move.

304
1276
00:46:38,884 --> 00:46:43,188
It's silly but this is our strategy.
 Help me out.

305
1281
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,654
<i>Joon Pyo, I'm sorry.</i>

306
1285
00:47:16,654 --> 00:47:20,091
<i>I just want to protect her.</i>

307
1289
00:47:21,927 --> 00:47:26,831
Yoon Ji Hoo, you must be out of your mind!

308
1293
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:33,838
Not once, but twice! 
 Wait, no, including the one at the airport, it's 3 times!

309
1298
00:47:35,873 --> 00:47:37,742
You're dead.

310
1302
00:49:57,348 --> 00:50:00,652
Jan Di, look at that.

311
1306
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:51,135
These boys.. they have grown so fast.

312
1310
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:52,904
I know.

313
1314
00:50:54,372 --> 00:51:00,711
I'm so glad I came back to Korea! 
 This is so much more entertaining than Hollywood.

314
1319
00:51:00,711 --> 00:51:03,681
I am pretty entertained as well.

315
1323
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:11,222
Die, die!

316
1327
00:51:14,857 --> 00:51:17,895
Monkeys can also fall off a tree sometimes.

317
1331
00:51:17,895 --> 00:51:21,866
He was so confident in himself.

318
1335
00:51:21,866 --> 00:51:30,174
By the way, Ji Hoo finally drove. 
I know!  If it wasn't for Geum Jan Di, would he have done that?

319
1340
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:35,813
Did you see them? They're pretty intimate now.

320
1344
00:51:35,813 --> 00:51:38,316
Die!

321
1348
00:51:44,122 --> 00:51:46,457
What's wrong? 
Why doesn't it work?

322
1353
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:53,030
Hey, it looks like it's broken! 
 Just look at how he treats it.

323
1358
00:51:59,771 --> 00:52:01,972
Now it's the final competition.

324
1362
00:52:01,972 --> 00:52:05,109
Let's open Jan Di's.

325
1366
00:52:22,827 --> 00:52:24,562
<i>Swimming</i>

326
1370
00:52:29,077 --> 00:52:33,603
Ridiculous. 
What is this!?

327
1375
00:52:33,603 --> 00:52:36,274
Hey Geum Jan Di, you did this on purpose, right?

328
1379
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:39,811
Tell me, you planned this all out!

329
1383
00:52:39,811 --> 00:52:43,313
I won't do this. 
I won't!

330
1388
00:52:43,313 --> 00:52:49,987
Do whatever you want. But if you forfeit, the competition ends here and Ji Hoo wins automatically.

331
1392
00:52:49,987 --> 00:52:56,761
- What are you talking about? 
 - I told you when the competition began you had to agree to the consequenses  regardless of the results.

332
1397
00:52:56,761 --> 00:53:04,502
Even though they agreed, if the competition just ends here, Joon Pyo and us too, we'd feel bad to lose like this.

333
1401
00:53:06,504 --> 00:53:08,138
So?

334
1405
00:53:08,138 --> 00:53:12,376
If it's ok with you, I'd like to compete in his place. 
What?

335
1410
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:17,915
Ji Hoo, he crossed the line this time.

336
1414
00:53:22,144 --> 00:53:27,718
Hmm, that sounds pretty reasonable.
 I'm ok with it if everyone else is.

337
1419
00:53:27,718 --> 00:53:32,021
What do you guys think? 
 I agree 100%.

338
1424
00:53:32,021 --> 00:53:34,423
I agree too.

339
1428
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:35,692
I'm against it.

340
1432
00:53:36,492 --> 00:53:41,230
What?  
Hey, Geum Jan Di!

341
1437
00:53:42,465 --> 00:53:43,867
I will join too.

342
1441
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:53,476
Since Yi Jung sunbae is playing for Goo Joon Pyo, I will play for Ji Hoo sunbae.

343
1445
00:53:53,476 --> 00:53:57,647
Your opponent is Yi Jung. 
 He's a guy and he's pretty good too.

344
1450
00:53:58,548 --> 00:54:02,251
This has to do with me too, I can't just sit back and watch.

345
1454
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:06,155
Don't be ridiculous, how can a girl compete against a guy? 
Just stay out of it!

346
1459
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:09,124
I also could get kicked out of school.

347
1463
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:12,929
So I should try my best 
That way I won't have any regrets later on, 
right?

348
1469
00:54:16,266 --> 00:54:21,170
Then . . . how about 2 vs 2?

349
1473
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,306
Me?

350
1477
00:54:23,306 --> 00:54:24,874
I agree.

351
1481
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:28,945
Jan Di, if this is how you want it to be, go for it.

352
1485
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:39,655
Goo Joon Pyo, I'm not going to let her win just because she's a girl.

353
1489
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:42,592
I'll try my best to beat Ji Hoo.

354
1493
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:56,773
OK, then until the final competition, 
 we have 70 hours left. Mmh?

355
1498
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:37,445
Can't you do any better?! 
Forget it, I'm not doing this!

356
1503
00:55:37,445 --> 00:55:40,616
Stupid! I bet even I could do better than you!

357
1507
00:56:07,877 --> 00:56:10,313
10 more minutes!

358
1511
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:38,440
Why did you ever say such a thing?

359
1515
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,844
Seriously... why did I?

360
1519
00:56:41,844 --> 00:56:47,683
You know what it is. 
Your desire to help out anyone.

361
1524
00:56:47,683 --> 00:56:50,920
I just didn't want sunbae to be left out because of me.

362
1528
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,457
So it's okay if he loses because of you? 
That's why I have to win.

363
1533
00:56:54,457 --> 00:56:55,325
Are you confident?

364
1537
00:56:56,259 --> 00:57:04,933
Ugh, what's going to happen? If only I had a time machine, then I could see what the future holds.

365
1541
00:57:04,933 --> 00:57:12,174
Jan Di!  A little bit faster, faster! 3, 2, 1!

366
1545
00:57:12,174 --> 00:57:14,076
What is it? What did you dream about?

367
1549
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:17,312
You dreamed about Jan Di's competition, right? 
 Who won?

368
1554
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:23,186
Until the last minutes of the race, it was neck and neck.

369
1558
00:57:23,186 --> 00:57:24,153
Neck and neck! And?

370
1562
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:28,123
They reached their hands and at that moment...

371
1566
00:57:28,123 --> 00:57:29,225
At that moment,

372
1570
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,795
It went black.

373
1574
00:57:32,795 --> 00:57:35,264
- Eh?
- Black.

374
1579
00:57:35,264 --> 00:57:37,833
Fade out.

375
1583
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:40,204
Then what is that? 
 It's a meaningless dream.

376
1588
00:57:40,204 --> 00:57:44,974
Ughh. You are no help at all!

377
1592
00:57:44,974 --> 00:57:51,713
This cannot happen.  Yi Jung or whatever his name is, we must do whatever we can.

378
1596
00:57:51,713 --> 00:57:57,287
Whatever we can? 
We can put laxatives in their porridge and give it to them.

379
1601
00:57:57,287 --> 00:58:01,295
No, Ga Eul!  How could you think of something like that!

380
1605
00:58:01,295 --> 00:58:06,095
You just can't distinguish between your allies and your enemies just because you admired his beauty!

381
1609
00:58:06,095 --> 00:58:10,868
No! I mean you can't use the holy porridge for such an evil scheme.

382
1613
00:58:10,868 --> 00:58:22,578
No, never!  Porridges are supposed to be given to cure the sick and to console the tired. 
 How many times do I have to tell you!??

383
1618
00:58:22,578 --> 00:58:25,414
He is not gonna stop now.

384
1622
00:58:25,414 --> 00:58:27,684
Okay. Okay..

385
1626
00:58:29,385 --> 00:58:34,789
Then, how about running him over with a bike from behind? 
Ga Eul!

386
1631
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:37,426
You see? I told you he liked him.

387
1635
00:59:07,955 --> 00:59:11,960
Then... you're telling me to deliberately lose?

388
1639
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,831
Whether they win or lose, it isn't your business. 
But for Jan Di . . .

389
1644
00:59:15,831 --> 00:59:16,866
She'll have to withdraw from school.

390
1648
00:59:16,866 --> 00:59:22,738
Aren't you embarrassed to work your butt off to win against a girl?

391
1652
00:59:22,738 --> 00:59:27,943
Don't you think it's even more embarrassing to lose after you work your butt off to win against a girl?

392
1656
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:32,281
So, you're saying even if you die, you'll win this race?

393
1660
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:36,819
Well, I have no intention of putting my life 
on the line over something like this, 
 but I'm saying I won't take this lightly.

394
1666
00:59:36,819 --> 00:59:37,787
Hey!

395
1670
00:59:37,787 --> 00:59:42,258
Hey, I don't think you're in a position to complain.

396
1674
00:59:42,258 --> 00:59:43,725
What?

397
1678
00:59:43,725 --> 00:59:47,696
I warned you, didn't I? I warned you that it would be best to stop her.

398
1682
00:59:47,696 --> 00:59:51,267
I came to your rice restaurant and gave you some friendly advice.

399
1686
00:59:52,234 --> 00:59:54,937
It's not a rice restaurant, but a porridge restaurant.

400
1690
00:59:54,937 --> 00:59:58,174
Those of the same species gather together..  So that's true after all.

401
1694
00:59:59,142 --> 01:00:00,442
What do you mean?

402
1698
01:00:00,442 --> 01:00:03,446
Geum Jan Di's nosiness, is that an infectious disease?

403
1702
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:04,580
You little!

404
1706
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,549
The door to leave is over there.

405
1710
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,928
Ah, cold!

406
1714
01:00:19,928 --> 01:00:21,597
I'm home!

407
1718
01:00:21,597 --> 01:00:23,899
Come over here.

408
1722
01:00:23,899 --> 01:00:28,003
Why? 
 What do you mean, "Why?"

409
1727
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:32,107
Did something happen? 
 That's what WE want to ask.

410
1732
01:00:32,107 --> 01:00:35,477
What is this about the competition and withdrawal from school?

411
1736
01:00:35,477 --> 01:00:42,417
Oh, that... 
Ah, be quiet!  Only answer with yes or no..

412
1741
01:00:42,417 --> 01:00:49,258
Mom, about that... 
You cheated on Goo Joon Pyo with Yoon Ji Hoo 
and now you're going to be expelled from school. Is that all true?!

413
1747
01:00:49,258 --> 01:00:51,695
Well, that is... 
Yes or no?

414
1752
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:52,628
Yes!

415
1756
01:00:53,596 --> 01:00:59,468
Oh-How-Oh my goodness! 
How can you when you're in such a school!!

416
1761
01:00:59,468 --> 01:01:06,375
About school... I can just attend the one I was in before. 
The one before?  The one before?!

417
1766
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:10,045
You! Is there a Joon Pyo in your old school? Speak, SPEAK!

418
1770
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:17,119
Honey, calm down. Let's think about this. He was too good for us from the beginning. 
But we still have our dry cleaning business!

419
1775
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,521
You'll see, things will stay good...

420
1779
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:22,258
Dad!  If Noona gets expelled, the business is over.

421
1783
01:01:22,258 --> 01:01:25,026
No one will come to our shop anymore!

422
1787
01:01:25,026 --> 01:01:36,138
This is not the time for this. Let's go apologizefor her fault. 
Honey, take out your curls. 
Kang San, take a mat.
Noona, I don't ever remember that I raised you like this.

423
1794
01:01:36,138 --> 01:01:38,641
I'm disappointed.

424
1798
01:01:40,376 --> 01:01:46,281
Dad!  
You!  The day you're expelled, you are disowned from the family.

425
1803
01:01:46,281 --> 01:01:49,084
Even if you think about it a hundred times, it was your fault.

426
1807
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:52,855
How dare you two-time when you're still wet behind your ears!

427
1811
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:57,795
How can you say that honey?  After all, she got it from you.

428
1815
01:01:57,795 --> 01:01:59,428
Oh my god, honey!

429
1819
01:01:59,428 --> 01:02:04,233
Huh? Mom? 
No!

430
1824
01:02:06,135 --> 01:02:21,650
I'm telling you this because I've experienced it firsthand, 
but when someone cheats, it really pisses you off. 
But when the girl says "sorry", it is the man's job to forgive. So...

431
1830
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:35,130
- So? 
- Apologize!  Apologize!  Apologize!
Apologize! Apologize! Apologize!

432
1836
01:03:01,123 --> 01:03:03,225
Goo Joon Pyo?

433
1840
01:03:13,968 --> 01:03:15,904
Where are you going this late?

434
1844
01:03:15,904 --> 01:03:18,473
I'm going to practice, why?

435
1848
01:03:18,473 --> 01:03:20,342
You want to win that badly?

436
1852
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:24,046
We have no choice.

437
1856
01:03:25,147 --> 01:03:27,216
We?

438
1860
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,088
Why does it have to be Ji Hoo?

439
1864
01:03:36,056 --> 01:03:38,827
If it wasn't Ji Hoo...

440
1868
01:03:38,827 --> 01:03:41,463
Goo Joon Pyo.

441
1872
01:03:47,235 --> 01:03:49,271
It's not too late.

442
1876
01:03:52,308 --> 01:03:54,610
Just once,

443
1880
01:03:56,578 --> 01:04:00,849
say that you like me..  Just once.

444
1884
01:04:26,305 --> 01:04:27,873
Geum Jan Di.

445
1888
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:30,876
Do you want to go on a date?

446
1892
01:04:30,876 --> 01:04:32,145
Date?

447
1896
01:04:32,145 --> 01:04:34,780
I can't imagine Ji Hoo and Jan Di together.

448
1900
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:38,217
They might just go somewhere sunny and take a nap.

449
1904
01:04:41,254 --> 01:04:44,090
I'll go out for some fresh air, and some exercise!

450
1908
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:45,191
With those clothes?

451
1912
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:52,131
Love doesn't always go as planned.

452
1916
01:04:52,131 --> 01:04:53,966
Where is this place?

453
1920
01:04:53,966 --> 01:04:55,201
My house.

454
1924
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:56,135
Huh?

455
1928
01:04:56,135 --> 01:04:59,271
I always thought that I was In debt  to Ji Hoo.

456
1932
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:04,577
I can't ruin Jan Di so that nobody will want her again.

457
1936
01:05:07,713 --> 01:05:11,083
What? 
What did you say?

01:05:13,686 --> 01:05:14,720
