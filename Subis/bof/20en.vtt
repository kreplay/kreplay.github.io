1
3
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,834
This one..

2
7
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:43,062
Ohh.  Isn't it pretty?

3
11
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:45,353
It's unique and doesn't look that difficult to make,

4
15
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:46,890
so I want to give it a try.

5
19
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,339
Where did you get it from?

6
23
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:51,604
Why?

7
27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,601
Tell me!  Where did you get this?!

8
31
00:01:56,996 --> 00:01:58,867
From the teacher who teaches here...

9
35
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:19,611
<i>To me that friend was</i>

10
39
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:21,845
<i>my kiln</i>

11
43
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:23,082
<i>and potter's wheel.</i>

12
47
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:27,889
<i>I was afraid</i>

13
51
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:31,742
<i>that I would make her cry.</i>

14
55
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:36,522
<i>Like my father...</i>

15
59
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:39,683
<i>and my mother...</i>

16
63
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:45,404
<i>I didn't want  her to end up crying because of me.</i>

17
67
00:02:48,078 --> 00:02:49,401
<i> I ran away.</i>

18
71
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,998
Impossible.

19
75
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:35,954
Get lost!

20
79
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,024
<i>I told you not to get involved with a man like him.</i>

21
83
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:07,308
<i>Do you know how insulting that was for him?</i>

22
87
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:10,730
<i>I gave them money for their troubles. What is the problem?</i>

23
91
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:13,603
<i>Was it not enough?</i>

24
95
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:15,597
<i>This is</i>

25
99
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:17,940
<i>the first time I've ever wanted something.</i>

26
103
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:20,761
<i>Can't you let me win just this once?</i>

27
107
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:21,832
<i>How?</i>

28
111
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,515
<i>How can that kind of a man be what you want?</i>

29
115
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:28,702
<i>You are Shin Hwa Group's heiress!</i>

30
119
00:07:28,702 --> 00:07:33,117
<i>Instead of meeting Korea's, no, Asia's best male prospects...</i>

31
123
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:34,920
<i>Get a hold of yourself!</i>

32
127
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:36,539
<i>To me..</i>

33
131
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:38,759
<i>that person is the 'best,'</i>

34
135
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:41,633
<i>because I love him.</i>

35
139
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:44,663
<i>Other men, no matter who they are, makes no difference to me!</i>

36
143
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:46,465
<i>Pathetic girl.</i>

37
147
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:52,552
<i>Marrying a man for a love that will fade in a few years</i>

38
151
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,862
<i>that will not be an option.</i>

39
155
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:54,829
<i>Mom!</i>

40
159
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:55,996
<i>That's right!</i>

41
163
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:57,332
<i>Because I am your mother.</i>

42
167
00:07:57,332 --> 00:08:00,000
<i>Because you were born into the Shin Hwa Group,</i>

43
171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,497
<i>I cannot allow your foolish gamble at love.</i>

44
175
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:06,736
<i>You can do that in your next life.</i>

45
179
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:07,261
Hey!

46
183
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,969
Miss?

47
187
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:14,550
What should we do?! Are you all right, Miss?

48
191
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:20,967
Hello?

49
195
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:24,215
The lady has fainted here!

50
199
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,227
If you're wondering where this is...

51
203
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:35,004
Are you awake?

52
207
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:39,427
What happened?

53
211
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:41,143
You were almost in big trouble!

54
215
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:43,076
You collapsed on the road.

55
219
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:45,688
But how did you...?

56
223
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:48,718
What would have happened if I had not called you at the right time?

57
227
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,633
Why were you being so foolish?

58
231
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,133
Didn't I tell you to call me if things got too hard for you?

59
235
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:56,947
Don't you consider us sisters anymore?

60
239
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,073
It's not that.

61
243
00:10:00,073 --> 00:10:01,492
Did something bad happen?

62
247
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:06,821
Then, from now on, you have to listen to what I say.

63
251
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:23,252
From now on, Jan Di, you are my guest.

64
255
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:27,353
Since your parents aren't around, you cannot leave this house until things get better for you.

65
259
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:28,216
Understand?

66
263
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:30,488
Unni.. but that is.. a little..

67
267
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:31,482
Regardless of Joon Pyo

68
271
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:34,015
didn't we decide that you were going to treat me as if I were your real older sister?

69
275
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,202
Even so...the President..

70
279
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:39,944
There's no need to worry about my mother.

71
283
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:42,155
She's out of the country for awhile.

72
287
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:44,124
You don't have any more concerns do you?

73
291
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:50,733
So lot of nerve, though, and you...

74
295
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,189
Right! That's the way it ought to be!

75
299
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:58,300
But...I have a condition too...

76
303
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,458
Condition?

77
307
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,436
I don't like to accept things for free.

78
311
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,145
For sleeping and eating in this house,

79
315
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:07,974
please put me to work.

80
319
00:11:08,914 --> 00:11:09,698
What?

81
323
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,237
I am curious about something.

82
327
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:27,308
About what?

83
331
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:31,279
What is your reason for being so nice to me?

84
335
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:34,156
You know, honestly

85
339
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:36,164
Goo Joon Pyo is already engaged.

86
343
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,388
If the President find out that you're doing this...

87
347
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:43,243
Are you really that curious?

88
351
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:45,699
Finished!

89
355
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:46,743
It's a gift!

90
359
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,452
From today onward, Geum Jan Di is the new maid.

91
363
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:19,344
She is like my sister, I want to give her all but she wants to work.

92
367
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:21,147
Everyone, please help her out.

93
371
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,610
Hello, I'm Geum Jan Di...

94
375
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,991
Please take care of me.

95
379
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,864
There is no need for us to take care of you!

96
383
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:50,639
Grandma.

97
387
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,945
Please take care of her.

98
391
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:56,525
If you have to ask that,

99
395
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,580
it's better if she doesn't start.

100
399
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,461
Granny, go a little gentler on her.

101
403
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:02,968
No. There's no need!

102
407
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,532
I will do my best!

103
411
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:06,678
Please treat me the same as you would the others.

104
415
00:13:06,678 --> 00:13:08,663
Your best will not do.

105
419
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:10,422
Perfect.

106
423
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,783
In this household perfection is a requirement.

107
427
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,683
Are you ready?

108
431
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,310
You are not a child. Answer the question!

109
435
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,664
Say, "Yes! I understand!"

110
439
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:24,102
Confidently and clearly.

111
443
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,114
Yes..I understand!

112
447
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:38,365
I have to return to the U.S.

113
451
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:39,801
Will you be fine on your own?

114
455
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:42,150
Don't worry about me.

115
459
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,948
You! You new girl!

116
463
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:48,213
What do you think you're doing, chatting instead of getting to work?

117
467
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:50,512
Yes, granny!

118
471
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,340
What do you mean, "Granny"?

119
475
00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:56,102
How did I become "Grandma" to Miss Geum Jan Di?

120
479
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:59,254
Then...what should I call you?

121
483
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:02,998
This is a divine work place for you and me.

122
487
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:04,830
Call me, "Sunbae!"

123
491
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,413
Oh.....Sunbae?

124
495
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:13,108
How long are you going to just stand there like an idiot?

125
499
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:16,103
If you're going to learn everything from the basics, every second and minute is precious!

126
503
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:17,470
Hurry up!

127
507
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:20,735
Yes!

128
511
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:40,641
<i>In this house, a maid</i>

129
515
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,044
<i>needs to meet all the needs of her master.</i>

130
519
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:47,171
<i>There is a list of all these things.</i>

131
523
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:51,076
<i>Ironing a shirt in one minute is a given.</i>

132
527
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:54,015
<i>Being able to correctly dust expensive artworks.</i>

133
531
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,206
<i>Knowing how to organize all the wines.</i>

134
535
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:04,568
Chambertin (wrong pronunciation)

135
539
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:06,006
Chambertin

136
543
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:14,757
<i>Now, we will memorize the menu.</i>

137
547
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:20,112
<i>Shrimp carpaccio with white truffle aioli.</i>

138
551
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:26,146
Shrimp-tu carpa...

139
555
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,572
<i>Skirt steak garnished with asparagus.</i>

140
559
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:40,043
Aa...As-pa-ra-gam (asparagus)

141
563
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:45,424
<i>Roast duck with bell pepper chutney.</i>

142
567
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:54,310
Duck?

143
571
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,844
I am hungry! Give me food.

144
575
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,839
Sprinkled basil oil on le...

145
579
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:26,050
Lentil corn!

146
583
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,325
Lentil corn.

147
587
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,001
Oh my!

148
591
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:34,691
Gran...Granny

149
595
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:36,494
Grandma, you're still alive?

150
599
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:41,517
Yes. No matter how you may wish for it, it seems I cannot go.

151
603
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:44,043
No, no that's not what I meant.

152
607
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:46,159
It's because I haven't seen you for so long!

153
611
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:47,857
What happened to you?

154
615
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,966
Didn't you say you were going to run the housekeeping school or something?

155
619
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:53,317
The house was such a mess.

156
623
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:56,582
I couldn't just sit and watch.

157
627
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:03,528
In the meantime, Butler Lee will be at the school on my behalf.

158
631
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:07,519
- Why? Is there a problem? 
- N... No.

159
636
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,669
Who is she?

160
640
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:11,419
Is she your student?

161
644
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:16,465
Where did you find such a stupid girl that can't even memorize the menu?

162
648
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:19,648
I took her on as my student because of an unavoidable situation.

163
652
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,973
I'll introduce her to you.

164
656
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,870
Come here.

165
660
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,430
Nice to meet you.

166
664
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:32,739
From now on

167
668
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:35,470
you will serve Master Jun Pyo here.

168
672
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,550
Please take care of me.

169
676
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,312
Ge...Geum Jan Di...

170
680
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,390
From today onwards, Geum Jan Di will be Master Jun Pyo's personal maid.

171
684
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:00,270
Per... Personal! Maid?

172
688
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:12,844
Please...I will do anything else you want me to!

173
692
00:18:12,844 --> 00:18:16,365
But what's this about Goo Jun Pyo's personal maid...

174
696
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:18,198
What do you mean, "Goo Joon Pyo"?

175
700
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,630
No one can call him like that in this house!

176
704
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:24,710
No matter what happens outside,

177
708
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,392
when you're working in this house,

178
712
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:29,270
call him, "Master!"

179
716
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:32,790
Ah...Yes...Yes!

180
720
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,490
So as I was saying, please reconsider this position with 'Master'.

181
724
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,495
Grandm- Sunbaenim...

182
728
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:40,950
Please, I am begging you...

183
732
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,139
Have you already forgotten?

184
736
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:51,050
It's not something that can be decided just because you wish it.

185
740
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,441
I should not have come here.

186
744
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,590
Maybe it is still okay for me to leave right now.

187
748
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:16,270
<i> I told you to come to me anytime you needed help.</i>

188
752
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,910
<i>Did you forget that we are unni-dongsaeng?</i>

189
756
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,157
<i>Oh..Geum Jan Di.</i>

190
760
00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:33,395
<i>Goo Joon Pyo's maid Geum Jan Di, reply to me now.</i>

191
764
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,670
Goo Jun Pyo?

192
768
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:45,630
<i>Ah..Geum Jan Di.</i>

193
772
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,150
<i>Report to my room immediately. 
 Over.</i>

194
777
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:52,830
What?

195
781
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,790
This guy is really!

196
785
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,410
Hey! What are you doing right now?

197
789
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,569
It took you 3 minutes to get here. Next time make it here in one.

198
793
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:26,370
What?

199
797
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,830
You really..

200
801
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,898
I, Goo Jun Pyo, command my personal maid Geum Jan Di

201
805
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:32,590
to make delicious ramen right away.

202
809
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,670
I don't want to!

203
813
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,530
You know I am holding back because of your sister.

204
817
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,930
I want my ramen in 10 minutes.

205
821
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,510
I'm hanging up.

206
825
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,230
Goo Jun Pyo..

207
829
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:49,230
Do you really want to die?

208
833
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,470
Who do you think you are addressing so informally?

209
837
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,070
Yes, sir.

210
841
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:56,014
What is this?

211
845
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,757
It's the ramen...!!!

212
849
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:00,616
that you wanted me to cook, Master.

213
853
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:05,165
- There's no lid!
- What li . . .!

214
858
00:22:16,206 --> 00:22:17,277
Satisfied?

215
862
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:22,033
- Where are you going?
- What do you want now?!...sir?

216
867
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,812
- What.. what is it?
- I want you to sit there until I finish.

217
872
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:40,892
There is a button on the side, push it.

218
876
00:22:54,737 --> 00:22:59,465
You! I mean... Master.

219
880
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:01,332
What are you trying to do?

220
884
00:23:01,332 --> 00:23:03,645
It's because the chair is so uncomfortable.

221
888
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:05,813
I'm just testing it. Just do as I say and sit.

222
892
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:23,191
Do you know what time it is?! How is it that you are still asleep?!

223
896
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:30,244
Hurry over to master's room.

224
900
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:31,785
What?

225
904
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:33,692
This early?

226
908
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,650
<i>Get out!</i>

227
912
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,881
<i>If you try to wake me up one more time, I will fire you! Got it?</i>

228
916
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:08,644
Sir. Jun Pyo, don't you think it's time to wake up?

229
920
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,621
Didn't I tell you? I'll fire you if you try to wake me up again? Do you want to die?

230
924
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:20,843
Goo Jun Pyo...

231
928
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,560
Get up!

232
932
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:28,179
How many people have to risk their jobs just to wake you up?

233
936
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:29,138
GET UP!

234
940
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:30,665
What the!

235
944
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:32,886
Geum Jan Di..

236
948
00:26:35,606 --> 00:26:39,390
Hey! Okay! I got it, I'll get up! I'm getting up.

237
952
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:14,237
About firing you . . . I take it back.

238
956
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:17,790
What? Thank you . . Thank you

239
960
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:20,533
Satisfied?

240
964
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,780
Thank you Geum Jan Di!

241
968
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:13,509
Yi Jung.

242
972
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:15,950
How did you . . . ?

243
976
00:28:18,237 --> 00:28:22,312
I used to be the one hiding, so I never got to seek.

244
980
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:30,410
It's pretty hard.

245
984
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:32,396
Cha Eun Jae

246
988
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,896
Don't you think you hid too well?

247
992
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:42,270
I was almost about to give up on the game.

248
996
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,255
Yi Jung...

249
1000
00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:14,505
Why does nothing work for both of us?

250
1004
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:17,039
What do you think is worse?

251
1008
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,677
Working as a personal maid under your ex-boyfriend,

252
1012
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:28,110
or accidentally putting your crush and his first love together as soon as you gather up the courage to ask him out?

253
1016
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:32,373
I think comparing the two situations is sad in itself.

254
1020
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,719
Hello?

255
1024
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:39,034
Jae Kyung unnie..

256
1028
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:41,524
Jan Di! Did you move again?

257
1032
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:44,128
Where did your house go? There's not even a trace of it left.

258
1036
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:47,619
Oh yeah. Something came up.

259
1040
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,350
So? Where did you go?

260
1044
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:54,716
Let's have another housewarming party! I'll buy you something good to eat!

261
1048
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:58,234
Ga Eul! Let's play truth or dare like the last time, too?

262
1052
00:29:58,234 --> 00:30:01,395
Doesn't that sound good? Tell me, where?

263
1056
00:30:05,052 --> 00:30:06,358
My house!

264
1060
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:13,725
Jan Di is sharing my room with me right now, 
so I don't think we can hang out like last time.
 That's why we haven't invited you.

265
1066
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:14,796
We're sorry.

266
1070
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:18,870
Oh, I see. I'm glad you're at least with Ga Eul.

267
1074
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,117
You could have stayed with me, too.

268
1078
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:24,200
Thank you for offering.

269
1082
00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:27,595
Oh yeah. Can you pack some porridge for me?

270
1086
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:28,732
Porridge?

271
1090
00:30:28,732 --> 00:30:32,869
Goo Joon Pyo is sick?

272
1094
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:34,597
I'm going to go visit him.

273
1098
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:35,511
Joon?

274
1102
00:30:36,215 --> 00:30:39,142
He was fine this morn-

275
1106
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:42,910
Jan Di. Isn't it time for you to go to the clinic?

276
1110
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,391
That's right. You're all done.

277
1114
00:31:04,516 --> 00:31:08,007
He's alright. Breathing's good.

278
1118
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:11,272
Even though he has a fever, he's still healthy.

279
1122
00:31:11,272 --> 00:31:12,970
Thank you.
 Goodbye.

280
1127
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,225
Goodbye

281
1131
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:35,870
Doctor.

282
1135
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,550
Grandpa!

283
1139
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,288
Grandpa...
Grandpa... are you okay?

284
1144
00:31:50,906 --> 00:31:53,070
Ah, I'm all right.

285
1148
00:31:54,174 --> 00:31:55,670
I know my own disease.

286
1152
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:01,510
There's nothing to be worried about.

287
1156
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,605
You're not okay.

288
1160
00:32:17,832 --> 00:32:20,350
What would have happened if I hadn't been here? This happened last time, too.

289
1164
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:26,322
You can't live by yourself like this.

290
1168
00:32:27,176 --> 00:32:31,799
So you plan on putting me in a retirement home?

291
1172
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,630
- Yes. 
- You!!

292
1177
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,950
Sunbae...

293
1181
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,795
What are you doing here all of a sudden?

294
1185
00:32:58,219 --> 00:32:59,072
What is all this?

295
1189
00:32:59,072 --> 00:33:01,196
It's for moving in.

296
1193
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:04,061
Do you have a spare room?

297
1197
00:33:10,382 --> 00:33:11,993
Come on, hurry!

298
1201
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,178
Come on, hu-

299
1205
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,268
Hold on a moment.

300
1209
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:24,567
<i>Come on, hurry!</i>

301
1213
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,571
Ah, I don't know what your motive is.

302
1217
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:44,708
Why don't I see my personal maid?

303
1221
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,866
- Pardon? 
- Eh Geum Ja...

304
1226
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,626
My new personal maid.

305
1230
00:33:52,626 --> 00:33:55,670
Her master is eating and she doesn't even show her face?

306
1234
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,776
New personal maid?

307
1238
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,250
Today is saturday, sir.

308
1242
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:02,027
So?

309
1246
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:06,632
So?

310
1250
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:12,476
When Mistress Joon Hee hired Geum...

311
1254
00:34:16,943 --> 00:34:21,828
Because of school and her part-time jobs

312
1258
00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:26,660
she's only required to work during the 5 weekdays.

313
1262
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,574
So..

314
1266
00:34:27,574 --> 00:34:28,698
Only five days?

315
1270
00:34:29,543 --> 00:34:32,773
What kind of maid is that?

316
1274
00:34:33,426 --> 00:34:35,725
Sir, Mistress Jae Kyung is here.

317
1278
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:36,774
What?!

318
1282
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:37,919
Joon....

319
1286
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:48,917
Our little Joon...Does it hurt? Should I nurse you back to health? Let's eat porridge.

320
1290
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:52,939
Are you sick?

321
1294
00:34:57,668 --> 00:34:59,287
Here.

322
1298
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:09,266
What are you doing Joon Pyo? Your fiancee says to open.

323
1302
00:35:12,566 --> 00:35:13,890
Good, you eat well.

324
1306
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,326
Does it taste good?

325
1310
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,047
Come and sit down.

326
1314
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:24,835
Here is...

327
1318
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:31,888
This is your home now.

328
1322
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:33,794
YOU!

329
1326
00:35:33,794 --> 00:35:37,124
What kind of person does this all of the sudden?

330
1330
00:35:37,124 --> 00:35:40,534
He and I need time to prepare our minds...

331
1334
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:42,729
You've been doing it for 15 years.

332
1338
00:35:42,729 --> 00:35:44,061
Preparing your mind.

333
1342
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:48,110
Was it not enough?

334
1346
00:35:51,854 --> 00:35:55,581
Also if you don't listen to me, I might tell him all about it.

335
1350
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:58,115
About what!?

336
1354
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:00,858
That you are sick.

337
1358
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:06,265
Should I do that?

338
1362
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,654
Look at you. Where did you learn all these bad things from?

339
1366
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:15,342
I've been told that.

340
1370
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:18,412
That I have good skills in dealing.

341
1374
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,886
Goodnight.

342
1378
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:27,371
- Jan Di...
- Yes.

343
1383
00:36:27,371 --> 00:36:29,854
Do you think he'll forgive me?

344
1387
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:34,739
What are you so scared of? You're his grandfather.

345
1391
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:38,892
If your grandson doesn't listen, just give him a good beating.

346
1395
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,176
Goodnight.

347
1399
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:23,143
What do you think you are doing?

348
1403
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:30,387
You and your grandpa needed a family.

349
1407
00:37:30,387 --> 00:37:32,521
All I did was help you guys find it.

350
1411
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:33,775
Geum Jan Di, I'm still...

351
1415
00:37:33,775 --> 00:37:35,734
You're not ready for it?

352
1419
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:40,828
Grandpa said the same thing.

353
1423
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:47,411
For something like this, how much time do you need to prepare...?

354
1427
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:52,348
Isn't that pointless?

355
1431
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:56,980
You said it before..

356
1435
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:02,012
It's impossible to know somebody completely.

357
1439
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:07,160
But you can at least know what kind of person he or she is.

358
1443
00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:13,978
The Ji Hoo I know

359
1447
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:18,993
still loves and misses his grandfather.

360
1451
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:24,479
So, he's capable of forgiving him.

361
1455
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,299
<i>Geum Jan Di..Answer me. Geum Jan Di..</i>

362
1459
00:38:53,558 --> 00:38:54,494
<i>My personal maid!</i>

363
1463
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:59,561
<i>Don't you think you're a little too absent just because you have the day off? Are you still not in?</i>

364
1467
00:39:03,728 --> 00:39:04,825
WHAT?!?

365
1471
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:06,954
I'm not supposed to be working right now.

366
1475
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:09,723
<i>Hurry here right now.</i>

367
1479
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:12,910
I start on Monday at five o'clock. Call me then.

368
1483
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:17,508
<i>You can earn extra money for extra hours.</i>

369
1487
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:29,158
What? Do you want me to make ramen?

370
1491
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:33,024
Huh? What is this?

371
1495
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:34,696
Sit still here.

372
1499
00:39:36,655 --> 00:39:38,214
What? What is this?

373
1503
00:39:38,214 --> 00:39:40,156
Hold on a minute and just sit still.

374
1507
00:39:43,996 --> 00:39:44,518
What is this?

375
1511
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,548
It's starting.

376
1515
00:40:41,256 --> 00:40:42,432
<i>Leave that there too..</i>

377
1519
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:48,265
<i>No.</i>

378
1523
00:40:48,265 --> 00:40:52,430
<i>Be proud that only the elite are allowed to congregate here.</i>

379
1527
00:40:58,044 --> 00:40:59,986
I want to leave!

380
1531
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:04,696
Geum Jan Di

381
1535
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:34,389
Goo Jun Pyo..

382
1539
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:35,904
There's a huge problem! A huge problem!

383
1543
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:40,097
Jae Kyung unnie..She is walking up here right now.

384
1547
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,068
What?

385
1551
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:49,831
What are we going to do? What are going to do now?

386
1555
00:41:49,831 --> 00:41:51,473
Why do we have to  do anything? Just stay still.

387
1559
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,588
It's better this way.

388
1563
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:56,985
This time is...
Ah..over there!!

389
1568
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,859
Hey! Where are you going?

390
1572
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,947
What are you doing?

391
1576
00:42:14,191 --> 00:42:15,750
Why would you go in here?

392
1580
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,935
Goo Jun Pyo..Close the door for me.

393
1584
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,070
I asked why you'd go in here?

394
1588
00:42:25,354 --> 00:42:26,530
Where are you? I'm here.

395
1592
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,766
So you were in here.

396
1596
00:42:42,517 --> 00:42:43,326
Hey Monkey.

397
1600
00:42:43,326 --> 00:42:44,945
Don't you sleep?

398
1604
00:42:44,945 --> 00:42:47,161
What kind of woman comes to someone else's house in the middle of the night?

399
1608
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:48,829
You're not "someone else." You're "someone I like."

400
1612
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:50,243
What?

401
1616
00:42:50,243 --> 00:42:51,920
Isn't it funny?

402
1620
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,804
My dad always said the words of a popular song has its philosophy.

403
1624
00:42:55,804 --> 00:42:58,329
I didn't know what it meant.

404
1628
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:01,046
But now I so understand it.

405
1632
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:02,526
Maybe because I'm dating?

406
1636
00:43:02,526 --> 00:43:04,494
What dating?

407
1640
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:06,601
Anyway, why are you here?

408
1644
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:07,594
To spend the night.

409
1648
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:18,935
To watch this together. I wanted to watch this, but I'm too scared to watch it alone.

410
1652
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:20,890
Good, right? Let's go.

411
1656
00:47:08,866 --> 00:47:11,478
I remember you liked this when you were young.

412
1660
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:14,586
Let's eat!

413
1664
00:47:15,788 --> 00:47:16,885
I'm not hungry.

414
1668
00:47:22,183 --> 00:47:24,199
Then at least take this.

415
1672
00:49:25,956 --> 00:49:27,001
<i>Jae Kyung... How did you...?</i>

416
1676
00:49:28,003 --> 00:49:29,666
<i>Jan Di... How could you do this?</i>

417
1680
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,879
<i>Why did you lie to me?
I thought you were my best friend.</i>

418
1685
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:36,645
<i>I wanted to be with you for the rest of my life like sisters! 
How could you do this to me?</i>

419
1690
00:49:37,772 --> 00:49:42,800
<i>Jae Kyung... That's not it.</i>

420
1694
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,208
<i>I'm sorry... The truth is...</i>

421
1698
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:48,774
<i>I don't want to hear excuses.</i>

422
1702
00:49:48,774 --> 00:49:52,079
<i>You lied to me, you hurt me more than you can imagine.</i>

423
1706
00:49:52,836 --> 00:49:55,318
<i>Please, listen to me.</i>

424
1710
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:18,436
Jan Di! What are you doing today?

425
1714
00:50:18,436 --> 00:50:22,028
I'm really sorry- I think i'm busy allllllll day! I'm so busy I don't think I can do anything today-

426
1718
00:50:22,028 --> 00:50:25,855
Right now I'm on my way out.

427
1722
00:50:27,521 --> 00:50:29,068
Really? okay..bye~

428
1726
00:50:30,788 --> 00:50:32,568
Bye..

429
1730
00:51:03,445 --> 00:51:05,901
Did you two sleep well?

430
1734
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:07,337
What are you doing here?

431
1738
00:51:07,337 --> 00:51:08,696
So early in the morning?

432
1742
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,319
Ah me? I came to go to work with you two!

433
1746
00:51:20,303 --> 00:51:23,925
Well, since it's the three of us, let's take the car.

434
1750
00:51:25,714 --> 00:51:28,209
Let's go! Hurry up! Let's go!

435
1754
00:51:30,495 --> 00:51:32,206
Here, ma'am...

436
1758
00:51:32,206 --> 00:51:34,165
Be careful, it's hot.

437
1762
00:51:44,222 --> 00:51:46,364
Oh! It's normal temperature.

438
1766
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:49,020
Here you go...

439
1770
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,406
Grandma! Grandma!

440
1774
00:51:57,205 --> 00:51:58,877
I don't want to!

441
1778
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:05,251
Mrs. Min...

442
1782
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:09,639
Oh hold on a minute.

443
1786
00:52:24,572 --> 00:52:26,462
Sunbae! Sunbae!

444
1790
00:52:26,462 --> 00:52:30,955
- Please  give us some tea.
- We didn't drink tea either.

445
1795
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,344
How did you get so handsome?

446
1799
00:52:42,128 --> 00:52:43,572
I think I'll drink a cup too.

447
1803
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:00,787
Yes, it's good.

448
1807
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,718
You can exit this way.

449
1811
00:53:23,135 --> 00:53:24,102
Please wait a little bit.

450
1815
00:55:04,726 --> 00:55:06,319
It has been a while since I have been here.

451
1819
00:55:07,686 --> 00:55:13,724
Do you remember getting in trouble from playing hide and seek in here?

452
1823
00:55:13,724 --> 00:55:18,779
Of course. I had to clean for a week as punishment.

453
1827
00:55:18,779 --> 00:55:26,306
Right. And you said you were cold so we tried to heat it up and we got in trouble again.

454
1831
00:55:26,306 --> 00:55:29,098
You were the one who told me you were cold.

455
1835
00:55:29,098 --> 00:55:32,624
No way! It was you!

456
1839
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:37,143
No... was it me?

457
1843
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:47,174
Your mother,  is she well?

458
1847
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:52,582
She's still the same.

459
1851
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:54,201
Do you want to know about my dad as well?

460
1855
00:55:55,717 --> 00:55:59,948
What about you? 
You have been well, right?

461
1860
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:03,240
Are you curious?

462
1864
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:05,774
Are you really curious?

463
1868
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:10,258
Do what?

464
1872
00:56:11,443 --> 00:56:14,899
How could you do that all of the sudden?

465
1876
00:56:14,899 --> 00:56:17,503
Without a warning...How could you disappear like that?

466
1880
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,794
Do you know how I felt?

467
1884
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:30,461
I felt suffocated--as though the air I breathed was all gone.

468
1888
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:33,908
Can you imagine how I felt?

469
1892
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:38,048
How could you have done that to me?

470
1896
00:56:39,302 --> 00:56:40,804
I wasn't the air.

471
1900
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,103
What?

472
1904
00:56:44,103 --> 00:56:48,452
I... I wasn't your air... Yi Jung.

473
1908
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:52,663
I was just a breeze that you mistook for air.

474
1912
00:56:55,889 --> 00:56:57,992
I thought of myself the same way, Yi Jung.

475
1916
00:56:59,804 --> 00:57:05,855
I thought, if I wanted to, I could stay at your side forever.

476
1920
00:57:06,609 --> 00:57:11,040
What are you trying to say?

477
1924
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:18,864
A breeze.. Once it passes by, it can't come back to the same place..Yi Jung.

478
1928
00:57:50,773 --> 00:57:53,059
Why are you being like this?

479
1932
00:57:58,607 --> 00:58:08,632
Oh, it' you Ga Eul..
 I want to sleep. Can we talk later?

480
1937
00:58:10,443 --> 00:58:15,759
Sunbae..How could you act so much better than me back then when now you've become like this?

481
1941
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:20,174
Can you shut up and leave?

482
1945
00:58:20,174 --> 00:58:24,113
No, if I shut up now,

483
1949
00:58:24,113 --> 00:58:30,179
I'll probably have to watch you spend your life in this condition, so I think I'll say a few more things.

484
1953
00:58:31,677 --> 00:58:35,198
Sunbae...
You're a liar.

485
1958
00:58:35,198 --> 00:58:37,388
You're immature.

486
1962
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,243
A pathetic coward.

487
1966
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,311
What did you say?

488
1970
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:44,915
You said you pretended because you didn't want to hurt her, right?

489
1974
00:58:44,915 --> 00:58:49,744
No, it was you, sunbae, who didn't want to get hurt.

490
1978
00:58:50,641 --> 00:58:53,832
You thought that she'll see you for what you are and that she'd run away.

491
1982
00:58:53,832 --> 00:58:54,603
Chu Ga Eul.

492
1986
00:58:54,603 --> 00:59:01,943
I know. Your cool and collected self is just a mask.

493
1990
00:59:02,976 --> 00:59:08,317
But the Yi Jung that I like... He's afraid of love.

494
1994
00:59:08,317 --> 00:59:11,974
He's afraid of people leaving, just like a child.

495
1998
00:59:41,306 --> 00:59:46,352
Children.. in front of what they really want, they don't hesitate.

496
2002
00:59:47,675 --> 00:59:52,987
Because if they lose it.. they know they'll start crying.

497
2006
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,397
Thank you for today.

498
2010
01:00:20,982 --> 01:00:25,146
You got to do more things for the first time because of me again, right?

499
2014
01:00:25,146 --> 01:00:27,006
Get in. I'll take you home.

500
2018
01:00:27,006 --> 01:00:28,931
No. I can go alone.

501
2022
01:00:48,372 --> 01:00:51,710
Aigoo, it must be heavy.

502
2026
01:00:54,688 --> 01:00:57,039
Doctor, let's go.

503
2030
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,762
Work time is over so I'm now "grandpa"?

504
2034
01:01:00,762 --> 01:01:04,014
Drive home safely, Grandpa.

505
2038
01:01:04,014 --> 01:01:06,156
- Put on your seatbelt!.
- Ok.

506
2043
01:01:21,516 --> 01:01:22,639
Drive safely!

507
2047
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:30,032
Drive safely!!

508
2051
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:06,655
Sir.

509
2055
01:02:09,872 --> 01:02:11,566
Master!

510
2059
01:02:26,979 --> 01:02:30,819
Sir!  It is time to wake up sir!

511
2063
01:02:31,759 --> 01:02:33,901
You should wake up now.

512
2067
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:35,939
Sir..

513
2071
01:02:39,317 --> 01:02:40,970
Sir...
 SIR!!!

514
2076
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:42,130
You..

515
2080
01:02:43,345 --> 01:02:44,710
You... What are you...?

516
2084
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:46,304
Five minutes.

517
2088
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:49,135
Let me stay like this for five minutes, then I'll get up.

518
2092
01:02:54,324 --> 01:02:57,010
Even when I'm holding you like this

519
2096
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:59,266
I can't believe you're really here.

520
2100
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,319
<i>Joon... I'm here!</i>

521
2104
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,223
<i>Let's...</i>
