1
3
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,872
Next, we have news about ShinHwa Group.

2
7
00:00:52,872 --> 00:00:58,677
ShinHwa Group is in dire straits because of the sudden collapse of Chairman Goo.

3
11
00:00:58,677 --> 00:01:02,916
The ongoing construction of the world class resort city is now in jeopardy.

4
15
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:08,521
They're saying that they see this crisis as an opportunity,
 and the global ambition for the world-class resort continues to move forward.

5
20
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:14,721
ShinHwa Group heir, Director Goo Joon Pyo is overseeing this particular project directly.

6
24
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:16,629
The world's eyes are on ShinHwa's heir, Goo Joon Pyo.

7
28
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:24,670
There's still no news from him?

8
32
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,941
It has been six months.

9
36
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:32,512
No matter how busy he is, shouldn't he at least give you a call?

10
40
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:37,450
Does he not get in touch with F4?

11
44
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:42,488
I think he is just being careful.

12
48
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,392
I think they are all busy.

13
52
00:01:46,392 --> 00:01:48,961
He's probably full of himself now that he's in college.

14
56
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:51,264
Hey, even without looking it's obvious.

15
60
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:56,169
He's probably so into girls, he's not even thinking about how his friends are doing.

16
64
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:58,371
He's probably not able to concentrate.

17
68
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:04,677
Hey, why are you acting like a country bumpkin?

18
72
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:07,780
I've been to the Blue House too, you know.

19
76
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:11,684
Hey, what's with the cook always sleeping?

20
80
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:14,554
Look at the state of this restaurant!  Tsk, tsk, tsk!

21
84
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:19,826
That grandfather came again.

22
88
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:26,065
Grandpa, what can I help you with today?

23
92
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:27,433
Shin Seol Ro. (Korean royal cuisine)

24
96
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:29,435
Shin, shin, Seol Ro?

25
100
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,171
What's that, grandpa?

26
104
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:34,273
You're too much, really.

27
108
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:37,243
Grandpa, why do you ask for things like that at a porridge restaurant?

28
112
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:40,646
So far you've ordered Ja Jang Myeon, Mae Gi Mae UnTang and . . .

29
116
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:43,483
Gua Me Gi, Sam Hab and . . . . What was that?

30
120
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:48,654
Tang... Tang Pyong?  What was it?

31
124
00:02:48,654 --> 00:02:49,455
Ah, Tang?

32
128
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:56,796
It looks like you youngsters take after the chef in your ignorance.

33
132
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:58,531
It's Tang Pyong Chae, you idiots!

34
136
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:00,666
Ah, Tang Pyong Chae . . .

35
140
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:06,072
Don't think of talking back to an elder. Just bring the food out.

36
144
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:49,048
Grandpa, does it taste that good?

37
148
00:03:49,048 --> 00:03:50,549
Good?!   What are you talking about?

38
152
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:56,989
I'm just forcing myself to eat it since it's already here.  Couldn't you see that?

39
156
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,927
Forcing yourself like that, you might end up eating the bowl.

40
160
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:05,765
Tell the cook that this serving ware is wasted on his food.

41
164
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:08,701
He's not the cook, he's the master (chief manager).

42
168
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:11,504
I don't know what you're saying he mastered.

43
172
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,677
Grandpa.

44
176
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:19,011
Hmm?

45
180
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:22,014
It's raining outside but you didn't bring an umbrella, right?

46
184
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:23,616
Make sure to bring it back next time you come!

47
188
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:26,686
The more I see you . . .

48
192
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:29,655
the more you seem like a lotus.

49
196
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:32,892
A lotus?

50
200
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:35,728
Do you know why a lotus blossoms in mud?

51
204
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:37,363
What?

52
208
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:39,298
That's your homework for next time.

53
212
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:44,437
Goodbye.

54
216
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:46,973
Jan Di,

55
220
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,175
Yes?

56
224
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:50,576
Listen closely.

57
228
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:51,677
To what?

58
232
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:54,247
He's not one to talk nonsense.

59
236
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:55,214
Got that?

60
240
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:57,783
Ahh, what the heck!  Really!

61
244
00:04:57,783 --> 00:05:00,119
Master, tell us.

62
248
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:02,488
It's not like you to play twenty questions.

63
252
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:03,522
Come on?

64
256
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:12,831
<i>The Blue House's Chef, "Bom Seong Chan"</i>

65
260
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:31,751
Noona, doesn't this look like Joon Pyo hyungnim?

66
264
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:35,888
Look. The curly hair and the lips . . .

67
268
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,791
It doesn't look like him at all.

68
272
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,794
Is that guy as cute or as cuddly as this doll?

69
276
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:43,496
The kitty would get mad if it heard.

70
280
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:46,498
Of course, it doesn't look like him at all.

71
284
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:48,868
Master Joon Pyo looks more like a tiger.

72
288
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:50,803
Isn't that so?

73
292
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,308
Noona, does your shoulder hurt again?

74
296
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:58,511
No, it's all right.

75
300
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:00,613
My shoulder hurts too.

76
304
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:03,983
Working, bent over like this every day.

77
308
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:07,053
Ohh, it really hurts.

78
312
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:09,789
At least Jan Di gets to swim and loosen it up.

79
316
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:13,793
Honey, we can smooth out the kinks for you.

80
320
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:15,161
Kang San, let's do it !

81
324
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:16,095
Okay ...

82
328
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:26,638
AAHHHH!  Kang San!  Lightly.  OWWW!

83
332
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:28,293
Softly, Kang San.

84
336
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:31,177
It hurts, it hurts. Kang San, softly.

85
340
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:02,308
Stupid!

86
344
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,413
It's not like you went to space or something.  Would it kill you to call once?

87
348
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:11,150
You!  Just wait 'til you get here . . .

88
352
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,251
You're dead.

89
356
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:28,033
I will come back soon.

90
360
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,968
Just stay there and wait for me.

91
364
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:32,438
I love you, Geum Jan Di.

92
368
00:07:48,754 --> 00:07:50,156
Hello?

93
372
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:53,659
Yes.  It's me.

94
376
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,296
Really?

95
380
00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:00,966
Ehh . . . really?!

96
384
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,638
Mom!  Dad!

97
388
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:07,706
What's with all the screaming this late at night?

98
392
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:10,042
You must have finally gotten a call from Master Joon Pyo.

99
396
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,845
Mom, Dad, they said you got a job!

100
400
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:14,480
- Oh god!
- What?

101
405
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:18,250
Hello?

102
409
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,185
Yes, this is Geum Il Bong.

103
413
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:21,554
Yes, yes . . . thank you.

104
417
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:23,756
Yes! Yes! By 8:00? Okay!

105
421
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:25,558
Okay! I understand! We'll be there!

106
425
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:34,533
Yes, manager.

107
429
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:37,403
Thank you.

108
433
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,640
Please make sure they don't find out.

109
437
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:51,183
Embattled by appointing Kang Hee Soo as Chairman, ShinHwa Group insists
 that this crisis will turn into opportunity.

110
442
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:54,153
Their ambitious global projects are moving forward.

111
446
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,328
Good job.

112
450
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:12,064
Are you all right?

113
454
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:16,468
Uh, eh . . . yes, I'm all right.

114
458
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:17,636
Thank you very much

115
462
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:34,186
Honey

116
466
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:37,189
Why are you just standing there?

117
470
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:38,557
Honey..

118
474
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:40,859
Did you see a ghost or something?

119
478
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,729
Pinch me.

120
482
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:51,236
Ah!  People say they like live, moving sculptures.

121
486
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:53,205
They really are.

122
490
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:08,374
You still haven't gone to the hospital?

123
494
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:11,778
I went.   I already went.

124
498
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:13,379
They said it's nothing.

125
502
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,138
What is this?

126
506
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:41,541
Okay, say it now.

127
510
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:43,676
What?

128
514
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:46,212
What you want to say to Joon Pyo.

129
518
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:49,148
There's a way to get this to him.

130
522
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:53,152
It was hard to get in touch with him after the funeral...

131
526
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:55,088
But this time it will definitely get there.

132
530
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:01,427
This is so sudden.

133
534
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:04,464
I don't really have anything to say to him.

134
538
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,599
Okay, begin!

135
542
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:15,975
I can't do this sort of thing.

136
546
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:25,618
Goo Joon Pyo,

137
550
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,088
Can you hear me?

138
554
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:36,763
Since you've been gone I've thought of you every day.

139
558
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:43,703
But why is it the only times I can remember are when we fought?

140
562
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,408
But isn't it strange . . .

141
566
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:54,580
Even though i can only think of the times we fought...

142
570
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:58,317
Whenever I think of you, I smile.

143
574
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:09,395
Goo Joon Pyo,

144
578
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,534
you're doing well, right?

145
582
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:19,772
When are you going to come fight with me?

146
586
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:08,674
You find me irresistable don't you?

147
590
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:16,949
There's yet to be a girl that hasn't fallen for me after seeing me like this.

148
594
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,884
Who's fallen for who?

149
598
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:22,021
I came here because I have something to say.

150
602
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:23,656
About Joon Pyo and Jan Di?

151
606
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:27,026
Yes.

152
610
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:32,765
Tell me...

153
614
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,102
About?

154
618
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:38,137
You still haven't changed you mind about

155
622
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:40,940
waiting for the one person of your destiny?

156
626
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:43,809
That doesn't have anything to do with this.

157
630
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:50,249
Do you think Joon Pyo is really Jan Di's partner in life?

158
634
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:55,054
Eternal partners or soulmates?  Can that be right?

159
638
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:57,889
That . . .

160
642
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:01,594
Miss Ga Eul, you're applying your beliefs to Geum Jan Di

161
646
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:04,230
What do you mean?

162
650
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:09,168
If it were me, I'd use that time to search for my own soulmate.

163
654
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:13,272
Though ... I don't really know if such a thing exists.

164
658
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:18,811
It seems like I shouldn't have come here

165
662
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:21,480
So I'll take my leave.

166
666
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:36,195
Sunbae, you believe in it too, don't you?

167
670
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,232
Soulmates.

168
674
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:44,135
That uncertained true love that you'll spend the rest of your life with.

169
678
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:48,207
I think that you also believe that such a true love exists.

170
682
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:50,910
What?

171
686
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:54,447
They say a strong "no" is "yes".

172
690
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:58,850
I think I get it now.

173
694
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,922
Sunbae, you do believe that it exists?

174
698
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:04,890
You're scared that it does maybe exist.

175
702
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:06,659
Why is that?

176
706
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:09,228
Don't act like you know everything about me.

177
710
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:15,935
For the first time, it feels as though you're just like everyone else.

178
714
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,338
It's a good thing I came here.

179
718
00:19:21,112 --> 00:19:24,343
We'll talk about Jan Di next time.

180
722
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:25,745
Well, goodbye.

181
726
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:54,072
Enjoy your meal.

182
730
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:11,157
HEY YOU!

183
734
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:15,928
Half of the appeal in the nine combo platter comes out in its look.

184
738
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:17,229
But look at this color! The color!

185
742
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:19,598
It looks delicious.

186
746
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,301
You two can try it too.

187
750
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:23,569
Really?

188
754
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,688
It's delicious!

189
758
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,096
You! Did you do your homework?

190
762
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:53,032
Homework ?

191
766
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:54,166
Yes.

192
770
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,672
Oh, the phone's ringing...

193
774
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,376
Ji Hoo sunbae?

194
778
00:21:07,113 --> 00:21:08,180
Now?

195
782
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:11,851
Just a minute.

196
786
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:29,668
Sunbae.

197
790
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,742
Aigoo, all I've done was ruin my appetite.

198
794
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:38,277
Excuse me.

199
798
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:39,912
What?!

200
802
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,716
What shall I make for you next time?

201
806
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:46,540
What do you mean next time?!

202
810
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,543
The one dish that you're most confident in making.

203
814
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:52,847
One that you feel is even more superior than the dishes of your father.

204
818
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:55,183
Okay!

205
822
00:22:01,422 --> 00:22:03,591
What's wrong?

206
826
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:05,193
There's a place you have to go.

207
830
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:06,794
Where?

208
834
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:07,862
You'll know when we get there.

209
838
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,045
Your shoulder is badly damaged.

210
842
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:59,581
Why didn't you get it checked out when it happened?

211
846
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:04,319
If you start treatment right away, you won't experience any future difficulties.

212
850
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,587
But swimming is . . .

213
854
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:43,992
I know...

214
858
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:49,530
That I'm not pretty,

215
862
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:51,766
not smart,

216
866
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,268
and that I don't have money.

217
870
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:59,674
But ...

218
874
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:02,243
there was just one thing ...

219
878
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:06,781
that I liked more than anything else

220
882
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:09,951
and I was good at.

221
886
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:19,794
They say I'm not supposed to do it anymore.

222
890
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:23,164
Swimming.

223
894
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:26,067
I'm never supposed to swim again.

224
898
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:44,385
What am I going to do now?

225
902
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:50,525
What do I do from now on?

226
906
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:58,433
You can start searching again, for something else you like.

227
910
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:05,473
Sunbae, you have your music.

228
914
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:09,977
Yi Jung sunbae has his pottery.

229
918
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:15,216
Goo Joon Pyo and Woo Bin sunbae will be inheriting businesses.

230
922
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:22,757
Everyone is following the road that they were meant to take.

231
926
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:27,795
But I don't know what I'm supposed to do now.

232
930
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,588
I'll help you.

233
934
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,592
I'll help you.

234
938
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,128
Let's find it together.

235
942
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,630
Sit down.

236
946
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:51,579
It was because of me.

237
950
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:52,780
That accident.

238
954
00:26:55,204 --> 00:26:56,417
Pardon?

239
958
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,186
I can vaguely remember that

240
962
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:02,123
I was in the backseat, playing around.

241
966
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:05,393
And I covered my father's eyes when he was driving.

242
970
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:09,096
They said they wrapped their arms around me to protect me

243
974
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:12,934
Everyone said it was a miracle.

244
978
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:16,337
And eventually, Grandpa

245
982
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,307
stopped coming to this house.

246
986
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:24,446
He probably didn't want to see the grandchild

247
990
00:27:24,446 --> 00:27:25,646
who killed his son.

248
994
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,820
At that point,

249
998
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,623
she took my hand and helped me start over again.

250
1002
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:37,124
That person.

251
1006
00:27:57,879 --> 00:27:59,513
Now, I think

252
1010
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,283
it's my turn.

253
1014
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:26,100
What are you doing?

254
1018
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,302
Is this all you were capable of (for showing love), sunbae?

255
1022
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:30,537
Go after her!

256
1026
00:29:30,537 --> 00:29:35,742
If she can't stay here with you then you should go to be with her!

257
1030
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:39,881
If you really love her.. is waiting around the way you'll show her how much you love her?

258
1034
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:42,216
Can you still say you love her after all this?

259
1038
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:13,280
Ga Eul, I made this new dish. What do you think of it?

260
1042
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,548
Well ...

261
1046
00:30:16,498 --> 00:30:17,931
This has to do well.

262
1050
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,376
Is it good?

263
1054
00:30:23,692 --> 00:30:28,496
Um, can you give me an advance?

264
1058
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:29,362
Huh?

265
1062
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:30,998
An advance.

266
1066
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:33,467
Jan Di, is your dad in trouble again?

267
1070
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:35,002
No.

268
1074
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,738
I just need it for something.

269
1078
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:41,540
How much do you need?

270
1082
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,310
￦ 2,000,000($ 2,000)

271
1086
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:46,580
What are you going to with 2 million won?

272
1090
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:49,016
It's for a plane ticket.

273
1094
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:50,584
A plane ticket?

274
1098
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:53,421
Are you by any chance . . .

275
1102
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:56,980
Jan Di,

276
1106
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,278
don't you see this?

277
1110
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:01,729
For a flower boy, his skin is his life.

278
1114
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:04,565
But mine became rough because of stress.

279
1118
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:07,435
I'd love to give it to you if I could...

280
1122
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:10,137
But I can't before this becomes a hit.

281
1126
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:18,746
If I sell one, I can get 500 won, right?

282
1130
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:21,823
If it's 100, 50,000 won($50).

283
1134
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:22,950
If we sell 1000...

284
1138
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,251
500,000 won($500)!

285
1142
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:25,920
aja!

286
1146
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,322
Guys, here.

287
1150
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,194
E.S.

288
1154
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:35,328
What does the ES mean?

289
1158
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:37,064
Enjoy Selling.

290
1162
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:39,861
Fighting!

291
1166
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:41,268
Fighting!

292
1170
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:44,004
Healthy abalone porridge, here!

293
1174
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:46,907
Tasty abalone porridge!

294
1178
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:50,166
Nice, warm abalone porridge!

295
1182
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:52,446
Would you like to try it?

296
1186
00:31:56,817 --> 00:31:58,953
At this rate, can we sell all of this today?

297
1190
00:31:58,953 --> 00:32:01,489
Sir, have some porridge!

298
1194
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:03,791
Have some porridge.

299
1198
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,520
Of course!

300
1202
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:07,053
Yes, yes.

301
1206
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,320
Please go inside.

302
1210
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,720
Have some nice, warm porridge inside.

303
1214
00:33:17,978 --> 00:33:20,338
Thank you!

304
1218
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,520
Would you like to try one?

305
1222
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:33,453
I'm sure you'll like it.

306
1226
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,587
Good job.

307
1230
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,387
I think you should do the count, Jan Di.

308
1234
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:59,253
Whoa.

309
1238
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,453
I didn't know that

310
1242
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:04,520
we could make this much money.

311
1246
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,053
But, I didn't earn all this money all by myself.

312
1250
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:09,553
Is it okay for me to keep it all?

313
1254
00:34:09,553 --> 00:34:11,220
You can keep it.

314
1258
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,720
It was pretty fun for us, too.

315
1262
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,053
But . . .

316
1266
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,520
Why did you guys come here all of the sudden?

317
1270
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:24,120
There's some place that you need to go with us.

318
1274
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:38,020
Swimmer, to your mark.

319
1278
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,720
Get ready.

320
1282
00:34:55,018 --> 00:34:57,753
Start!

321
1286
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:06,687
From now on . . .

322
1290
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:10,853
Right now...

323
1294
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,087
We will begin Swimmer Geum Jan Di's

324
1298
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:16,453
retirement ceremony.

325
1302
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,853
First, we will present our distinguished service award.

326
1306
00:37:26,587 --> 00:37:27,787
Distinguished Service Award.

327
1310
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,887
ShinHwa High School's Distinguished Service Award is presented to Geum Jan Di

328
1314
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:32,653
based on

329
1318
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:35,020
her natural nosiness and

330
1322
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,953
the weed spirit

331
1326
00:37:36,953 --> 00:37:43,253
as the only student with special ability in swimming at the fiercely prestigious
 aristocratic ShinHwa High school

332
1331
00:37:43,253 --> 00:37:46,853
especially with the specialty of taming 
F4 and Goo Joon Pyo

333
1336
00:37:46,853 --> 00:37:49,753
she is second to none

334
1340
00:37:49,753 --> 00:37:54,620
thus raising the standards for her sportsmanship and therefore awarded Distinguished Service

335
1344
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,287
by Korea's F4 members.

336
1348
00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:13,996
Geum Jan Di,

337
1352
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:16,220
an ending means another beginning.

338
1356
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,553
You know that, don't you?

339
1360
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:20,653
Now go to Macau, to Joon Pyo,

340
1364
00:38:20,653 --> 00:38:24,620
and give it to him good.

341
1368
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:27,287
Thank you!

342
1372
00:38:27,287 --> 00:38:28,653
Jan Di,

343
1376
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:31,953
have a safe trip.

344
1380
00:38:37,153 --> 00:38:38,953
I will.

345
1384
00:38:57,887 --> 00:38:59,487
<i>Macau Airport</i>

346
1388
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:05,620
Hey, come here!

347
1392
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,720
One hundred dollars to Macau, okay?

348
1396
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,287
$100? Taxi?

349
1400
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:12,487
$100, very cheap.

350
1404
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:13,487
Macau. Yes?

351
1408
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:14,253
Okay?

352
1412
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,087
Wait, wait.

353
1416
00:39:29,553 --> 00:39:31,620
19,700 won?!

354
1420
00:39:34,153 --> 00:39:37,320
I'm sorry.

355
1424
00:39:39,897 --> 00:39:40,897
Thank you.

356
1428
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,953
Thank you.

357
1432
00:39:43,953 --> 00:39:47,887
It`s too expensive!  How can I ride a taxi for 19,700 won?

358
1436
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,687
Bus. BUS!

359
1440
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:56,320
Bus, wait!

360
1444
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,987
Wait, bus. Bus, WAIT!

361
1448
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,287
Thank you.

362
1452
00:41:53,853 --> 00:41:56,420
All of this is Goo Joon Pyo's?!

363
1456
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,220
They say this is the place to be, but now I can really feel it.

364
1460
00:42:03,553 --> 00:42:06,120
Where's the entrance?

365
1464
00:42:31,987 --> 00:42:34,687
Goo Joon Pyo.

366
1468
00:42:54,753 --> 00:42:56,320
This is for VIPs.

367
1472
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,120
I came to meet Goo Joon Pyo.

368
1476
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,887
Joon Pyo.

369
1480
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:03,253
We can't have the public gather here, please step outside.

370
1484
00:43:03,253 --> 00:43:04,320
We're going to need you to leave the premises.

371
1488
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,220
Meet Joon Pyo.

372
1492
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,487
Goo Joon Pyo.

373
1496
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,720
Miss.

374
1500
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,020
Goo Joon Pyo!

375
1504
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,187
Sheesh~

376
1508
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:21,753
Hey!  Hey, hey!

377
1512
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,534
It's true!

378
1516
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:34,545
Just ask him!

379
1520
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,245
Goo...

380
1524
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:39,482
Okay, I get it. I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

381
1528
00:43:41,387 --> 00:43:42,553
Goo Joon ...

382
1532
00:45:31,843 --> 00:45:33,298
How much?

383
1536
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:34,369
Nine Dollars

384
1540
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:43,956
Okay.

385
1544
00:45:48,402 --> 00:45:49,468
Thank You.

386
1548
00:46:11,045 --> 00:46:12,599
Mmm.  It's good.

387
1552
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,415
Can I try this please?

388
1556
00:46:19,091 --> 00:46:21,998
Wow, this is it...

389
1560
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:25,388
How much?

390
1564
00:46:25,388 --> 00:46:26,640
How much?

391
1568
00:46:32,853 --> 00:46:34,895
Give her wallet back while I'm still being polite about it.

392
1572
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:41,295
W, wal, let, my wallet!

393
1576
00:46:41,295 --> 00:46:44,664
Ohh, thief!

394
1580
00:46:44,664 --> 00:46:47,224
He's a thief!

395
1584
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:48,661
Are you Korean? 
 Thank you.


396
1590
00:46:52,046 --> 00:46:55,390
Stay put.

397
1594
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,089
Hey, you!

398
1598
00:46:57,089 --> 00:46:58,587
You speak English?

399
1602
00:46:58,587 --> 00:47:00,965
I'm a black belt holder of TaeKwonDo.

400
1606
00:47:00,965 --> 00:47:02,527
You know? You know TaeKwonDo?

401
1610
00:47:04,627 --> 00:47:06,320
Fine.

402
1614
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,305
Come on, just let her go while things can still end well.  You're just making things worse.

403
1618
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:09,711
Why don't you hurry up and let go of her?

404
1622
00:47:09,711 --> 00:47:11,936
Your crime is getting more and more serious.

405
1626
00:47:11,936 --> 00:47:15,802
Before you were just a thief.  Now you're holding someone as a hostage.

406
1630
00:47:15,802 --> 00:47:17,678
Go!  Go away!!

407
1634
00:47:19,624 --> 00:47:21,540
Ahh, what a really annoying man.

408
1638
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,843
I gave you a chance, okay?

409
1642
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:25,850
If you blame me later, you're really a loser, got it?

410
1646
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,864
When I say 1, 2, 3 bite his arm and run!

411
1650
00:47:28,864 --> 00:47:30,082
What?

412
1654
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:31,450
Don't you know Korean??

413
1658
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,852
Yes.  Of course I know.

414
1662
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:35,026
1, 2 . . .

415
1666
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:36,831
Oh, wait a sec!

416
1670
00:47:36,831 --> 00:47:37,588
Why?

417
1674
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:42,672
Do I bite after the count of 3 or on 3?

418
1678
00:47:42,672 --> 00:47:44,924
You're a funny one aren't you?

419
1682
00:47:44,924 --> 00:47:46,549
One, two, three! Now!

420
1686
00:47:50,241 --> 00:47:51,616
You're dead!

421
1690
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,282
Your wallet. 
Thank you!


422
1696
00:48:17,383 --> 00:48:20,090
Come on, let's go. If we get caught it's going to be a pain for us.

423
1700
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:30,770
It's him.

424
1704
00:48:32,172 --> 00:48:34,470
I don't know how I can thank you.

425
1708
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:38,320
Now I know what it's like to meet another Korean when traveling abroad.

426
1712
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:42,185
This is your first time abroad?

427
1716
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,018
It's my first time by myself.

428
1720
00:48:45,511 --> 00:48:46,944
Why Macau?

429
1724
00:48:48,315 --> 00:48:50,235
I'm looking for someone.

430
1728
00:48:50,235 --> 00:48:52,925
Ahh, it must be your boyfriend.

431
1732
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:56,531
Ahh, ye.  Kind of.

432
1736
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:58,206
I envy you!

433
1740
00:48:58,206 --> 00:49:00,919
Well, it's not always something to be envious of.

434
1744
00:49:00,919 --> 00:49:02,007
Ahh!  That's right.

435
1748
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:04,536
Honey, you were going to buy jerky, right?

436
1752
00:49:04,536 --> 00:49:05,700
Follow me.

437
1756
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,153
Honey?

438
1760
00:49:10,153 --> 00:49:12,027
Me?!

439
1764
00:49:26,642 --> 00:49:28,975
Mmmm, tastes good.

440
1768
00:49:28,975 --> 00:49:33,433
Hmm, very delicious!

441
1772
00:49:33,433 --> 00:49:36,354
One is ten dollars?

442
1776
00:49:36,354 --> 00:49:37,787
Yes.

443
1780
00:49:37,787 --> 00:49:40,620
If I buy ten, can you give me a discount?

444
1784
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,187
How about seventy dollars?

445
1788
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,826
No way, no way.

446
1792
00:49:43,826 --> 00:49:45,841
Hey, I'm not buying it then.

447
1796
00:49:45,841 --> 00:49:47,395
I'm not buying it then.

448
1800
00:49:47,395 --> 00:49:49,653
Ahh, okay, okay, okay, very well then.

449
1804
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,787
Ten pieces.

450
1808
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:54,627
Okay, 70 dollars then.

451
1812
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,822
I saved $30 off the price by buying yours and mine together.

452
1816
00:50:00,822 --> 00:50:03,012
See, there's no business that can't be negotiated.

453
1820
00:50:25,277 --> 00:50:27,480
It was nice to meet you!

454
1824
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,830
Be careful.

455
1828
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:29,887
You can say that again.

456
1832
00:50:34,524 --> 00:50:36,623
Hey!  Wait!

457
1836
00:50:36,623 --> 00:50:38,295
Can I at least know your name?

458
1840
00:50:38,295 --> 00:50:41,229
Me?? Jae Kyung. Ha Jae Kyung.

459
1844
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:44,887
Oh, Ha Jae Kyung!

460
1848
00:50:47,387 --> 00:50:53,453
Hey! Wait!  My name is Geum Jan Di!

461
1852
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,482
Is this a hotel or a cathedral?

462
1856
00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:00,731
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

463
1860
00:54:00,731 --> 00:54:02,353
Oh, OK.

464
1864
00:54:02,353 --> 00:54:02,950
Ok

465
1868
00:54:27,663 --> 00:54:29,663
Sorry.

466
1872
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:45,428
He didn't  see me.

467
1876
00:54:45,428 --> 00:54:47,515
Even if he did see me, he probably thought it wasn't me.

468
1880
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,544
Yes, of course.  It's weird that I came to Macau all of a sudden.

469
1884
00:54:51,544 --> 00:54:53,701
It's weird.

470
1888
00:54:53,701 --> 00:54:56,057
That's really weird.

471
1892
00:54:56,057 --> 00:54:58,199
It's weird, weird, it's just weird.

472
1896
00:55:25,877 --> 00:55:28,153
Are you okay, young master?

473
1900
00:55:28,153 --> 00:55:28,953
About what?!

474
1904
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,830
Just now, Geum Jan Di.

475
1908
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,584
When will the JK group be arriving?

476
1912
00:55:34,974 --> 00:55:36,274
If that goes wrong,

477
1916
00:55:36,274 --> 00:55:39,201
the old witch might just kill me,

478
1920
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:41,401
so please take care of it.

479
1924
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,216
Hi.

480
1928
00:56:05,584 --> 00:56:06,185
Hey!

481
1932
00:56:07,183 --> 00:56:09,583
Hotel! Cheap!

482
1936
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,021
Cheap! Ssayo, Ssa! (I'ts cheap)

483
1940
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:13,404
You have a cheap room?

484
1944
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:14,004
Uh-huh!

485
1948
00:56:15,649 --> 00:56:17,752
That's all right, I'll carry it myself.

486
1952
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:19,086
Oh that's all right.  I'll carry it.

487
1956
00:56:19,086 --> 00:56:20,757
Oh, it's okay. I'll take it for you.

488
1960
00:56:22,995 --> 00:56:24,595
Ohh, follow me.

489
1964
00:56:24,595 --> 00:56:26,233
Okay.

490
1968
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:41,394
Hey, hey!

491
1972
00:56:42,116 --> 00:56:44,212
Hey!  Hey!

492
1976
00:56:45,347 --> 00:56:47,590
You stop right there!  Do you hear?!

493
1980
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:48,922
You!  You are so dead!

494
1984
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:50,990
Hey !!

495
1988
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,297
Hey!   Hey!

496
1992
00:56:53,297 --> 00:56:57,615
Stop!  Stop!

497
1996
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:59,592
Give me back my bag!

498
2000
00:57:04,308 --> 00:57:05,808
I have

499
2004
00:57:05,808 --> 00:57:07,889
a little brother like you,

500
2008
00:57:07,889 --> 00:57:09,519
so I will give you a chance.

501
2012
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:10,819
So will you give me my bag?!

502
2016
00:57:10,819 --> 00:57:12,884
You! Idiot!

503
2020
00:57:12,884 --> 00:57:16,057
Ahh really! Do you really want to die?!

504
2024
00:57:17,057 --> 00:57:19,571
Let go!  LET GO!

505
2028
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:27,990
Ahh, this is really!

506
2032
00:57:29,276 --> 00:57:30,176
What's this?!

507
2036
00:57:30,176 --> 00:57:32,366
Looking at you, you're probably worth 3,000 at most.

508
2040
00:57:32,718 --> 00:57:35,457
If you're obedient,

509
2044
00:57:37,057 --> 00:57:38,923
it'll make things easier for you from now on.

510
2048
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,972
Ohh. Ahh! Help-pp me!

511
2052
00:57:42,972 --> 00:57:45,240
Help me!!! help me!! Ahhhh!

512
2056
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,633
Help me!   Goo Joon Pyo!

513
2060
00:58:33,315 --> 00:58:35,422
Do you guys know "Il Shil Hweh"?

514
2064
00:58:35,422 --> 00:58:36,290
What?

515
2068
00:58:37,357 --> 00:58:38,357
Are you Prince Song?

516
2072
00:58:38,357 --> 00:58:39,057
Yeah.

517
2076
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:47,951
I'm sorry...forgive us.

518
2080
00:58:47,951 --> 00:58:49,290
Forgive us.

519
2084
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,783
Hurry, get lost!

520
2088
00:58:50,783 --> 00:58:52,083
Let's go.

521
2092
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,259
What's going on?

522
2096
00:59:08,259 --> 00:59:09,859
I just knew.

523
2100
00:59:09,859 --> 00:59:12,828
I just knew you would be crying like this.

524
2104
00:59:41,423 --> 00:59:42,961
Joon Pyo must be really busy.

525
2108
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:46,605
Even though we're here, he's not able to rework his schedule.

526
2112
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:48,307
What?

527
2116
00:59:48,307 --> 00:59:50,680
You don't think he's actually matured after all this time, do you?

528
2120
00:59:51,275 --> 00:59:53,175
Remember, his father passed away.

529
2124
00:59:53,175 --> 00:59:56,166
Een if he did mature, it couldn't be helped.

530
2128
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:58,867
It's just hitting me, but it feels kind of sad...

531
2132
00:59:58,867 --> 00:59:59,867
What does?

532
2136
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:01,890
He's not part of F4 anymore.

533
2140
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,686
He's now the owner of the ShinHwa Group.

534
2144
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:07,883
Hey, Jan Di...

535
2148
01:00:07,883 --> 01:00:09,457
Were you able to meet with Joon Pyo yet?

536
2152
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:11,499
Pardon?

537
2156
01:00:11,499 --> 01:00:14,523
I haven't met him.

538
2160
01:00:15,482 --> 01:00:17,682
He looked really busy and stressed.

539
2164
01:00:17,682 --> 01:00:19,257
How could I meet with him?

540
2168
01:00:20,323 --> 01:00:22,790
Then how do you know that he's busy and stressed?

541
2172
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:26,288
Ah, that . . .

542
2176
01:00:26,288 --> 01:00:29,367
A hunch, just a hunch.

543
2180
01:00:29,367 --> 01:00:31,997
He has to take care of all of this.

544
2184
01:00:31,997 --> 01:00:33,757
It would be strange if he weren't busy.

545
2188
01:00:35,561 --> 01:00:37,561
In any case, I'm sure we'll 
eventually get to see him.

546
2193
01:00:37,561 --> 01:00:40,300
While we're waiting, should we loosen up a bit?

547
2197
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,866
Okay!  Let's go!

548
2201
01:00:42,866 --> 01:00:43,766
Let's go.

549
2205
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:50,647
Manager Kim

550
2209
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,257
will report the rest.

551
2213
01:00:52,257 --> 01:00:53,928
When the reports are finished.

552
2217
01:00:53,928 --> 01:00:55,028
Alright sir.

553
2221
01:03:47,285 --> 01:03:49,023
You should make a bit of time

554
2225
01:03:49,023 --> 01:03:50,683
for your F4 friends..

555
2229
01:03:50,683 --> 01:03:51,294
Will you take out your time and meet your F4 friends?

556
2233
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:52,030
Am I really that free?

557
2237
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,046
Do you think I want to change my schedule

558
2241
01:03:54,046 --> 01:03:55,490
and play around with them?

559
2245
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,106
Apart from that, that guy

560
2249
01:03:57,106 --> 01:03:58,508
really has gotten weird.

561
2253
01:03:58,508 --> 01:04:03,049
Whatever he has to say I came to hear it directly from Goo Joon Pyo.

562
2257
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:04,957
I have to meet him.

563
2261
01:04:04,957 --> 01:04:07,164
Are you telling the truth?

564
2265
01:04:07,164 --> 01:04:09,670
I was always this kind of person,

565
2269
01:04:10,329 --> 01:04:12,674
I was just pretending not to be.

566
2273
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:14,739
Hey, ugly girl there,

567
2277
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:16,559
Buy me some ice cream!!!

568
2281
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,845
Give me this one day.

569
2285
01:04:18,845 --> 01:04:22,070
Ji Hoo, do you like her?

570
2289
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:23,033
What?

571
2293
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:27,367
When Ji Hoo looks at the girl, he smiles.

572
2297
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:28,962
Get on my back.

573
2301
01:04:28,962 --> 01:04:32,462
Because of you, I've done many things that I never would have done.

574
2305
01:04:32,462 --> 01:04:34,069
So now . . .
