31
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,200
The ShinHwa Group has been selected as one of the biggest

9
35
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,340
sponsors for the 2012 London Olympics.

10
39
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:59,449
In the midst of a global financial crisis..

11
43
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,906
Since the  start of Korea's economic development,

12
47
00:01:01,906 --> 00:01:04,544
a single company has been holding the highest ranking.

13
51
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:06,903
Continuing with its ever continuous growth,

14
55
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:10,669
one entity has finally been established in the international market as a world-class company.

15
59
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,060
And that company is  ShinHwa.

16
63
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,040
From electronics, oil refineries and automobiles
to delivery and telecommunications,

17
68
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,495
even if you're a Korean who 
 doesn't know the President's name,

18
73
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:25,516
you would have definitely have come 
across the words "ShinHwa."

19
78
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:29,821
It is  a massive empire; a model  Korean conglomerate.

20
82
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:37,209
When ShinHwa achieved an unprecedented $10 billion in exports,

21
86
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:43,370
and its founder was invited to the Blue House, he refused to accept a medal of honor and instead said,

22
90
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,998
"Mr. President, please allow me to build a
school for my grandchildren."

23
95
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:53,297
<i>Incorporated  Association, Shin Hwa Academy.</i>

24
99
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:58,522
The school is the first of its kind to be seen 
in the history of Korean education.

25
104
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:03,220
This was during a time when economic development was more important than equal opportunities in education..

26
108
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,272
The President spared no expense 
and even passed special laws to make his school a reality.

27
113
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:11,836
Now there's even a saying that a family won't get
anywhere without a  ShinHwa graduate.

28
118
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:19,285
ShinHwa was based on and  built by  the 
top 1% of Korean society, for the top 1% of society.

29
123
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,390
Also, enrollment is so competitive that even most upper class children aren't accepted even if they apply for registration the moment after their birth

30
127
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:33,487
However, once enrolled, students can attend ShinHwa from elementary, middle and high school, all the way to university.

31
131
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:40,670
For the Korean students and parents frustrated by college entrance exams, ShinHwa is both the object of their hatred and envy.

32
135
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,995
However, in this school for the 
chosen sons and daughters of God,

33
140
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:50,405
something beyond anyone's imagination is  happening.

34
144
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:24,416
Oh, poor Min Ha.  What shall we do about this?

35
148
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:25,986
You  bastard!

36
152
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,540
Aish. Damn it! Get him!  Get him!

37
156
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,841
How may  I help you?

38
160
00:03:55,841 --> 00:04:00,352
I have a delivery from Jan Di's Dry Cleaning Service.

39
164
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,243
Okay, you may go in.

40
168
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:07,559
Thank  you.

41
172
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,755
Aish, this isn't it.

42
176
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:15,863
Find him!!!!

43
180
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:37,382
There! There he is! Get him!

44
184
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,801
Wow... Is  this really a school?

45
188
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:33,706
Hey, he's on the rooftop! Lee Min Ha is going to jump!!

46
192
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:35,307
What?  Are you serious?

47
196
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:37,596
Is he putting on a show?
 No!  This is for real!

48
201
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,011
Really? 
Are you serious?

49
206
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:44,016
Lee Min Ha???
  Lee Min Ha!

50
211
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:06,572
I was right, huh?.

51
215
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:09,107
He couldn't even last  a week.

52
219
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:11,747
But he did survive three  days.

53
223
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:15,180
It wasn't even three days.   Exactly speaking.

54
227
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,547
This is what you guys wanted.  Right?.

55
231
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:35,683
Fine,

56
235
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:37,202
I'll do as you guys  wish.

57
239
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:52,251
Just a minute!  Wait a moment, Lee Min Ah!!!!!

58
243
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:54,019
Oh no, what a customer!

59
247
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:59,091
Wh.. Wh.. Who are you?

60
251
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:03,195
Me? Oh, hehhh. I am

61
255
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:05,130
I have a delivery  for you!

62
259
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,733
Jan Di Cleaners. That will be $30.

63
263
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,368
Oh, my God! This is  funny!

64
267
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:18,843
Okay, Okay, $25 then.

65
271
00:08:18,843 --> 00:08:22,714
The gym suit is free. In return, you should be a  patron.

66
275
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:27,452
After I die settle it with my family.

67
279
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:30,422
Ah, seriously!  Don't be like that.

68
283
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:33,025
D-d-die?!

69
287
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:35,894
Now? Are you going to die right now?

70
291
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:37,762
But why?

71
295
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:43,368
I mean,

72
299
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:45,937
you attend a great school like this.

73
303
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:48,840
This isn't a  school.

74
307
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,074
This is  hell.

75
311
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,244
Excuse me!!!

76
315
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:58,535
The real hell is out there. Have you ever
heard about the hell of college entrance exams?

77
320
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:02,220
Have you ever heard of the F4?!

78
324
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:06,925
F... F... What?!

79
328
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:08,994
F4?!

80
332
00:09:09,828 --> 00:09:11,396
What is that?!

81
336
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:17,135
Once you get their red card, you become
the target of all the students in school....

82
341
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:19,137
Just like me....

83
345
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:27,812
So are you going to just sit back and take it?!

84
349
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:32,217
Losers like that always move around
 in large groups doing cruel things...

85
354
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:39,690
If it was my school, I would  catch them and kill them!!

86
358
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:42,627
How lucky

87
362
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,262
your friends are.......

88
366
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:47,065
Huh?!

89
370
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,367
Your friends.  They're lucky to have a friend like you.

90
374
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,523
Not really. hahaha..

91
378
00:09:58,877 --> 00:10:00,378
NOOOO!!!

92
382
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:19,532
At the  cradle of privileged education...Shin Hwa High School

93
386
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:21,967
saving an ostracized student was...

94
390
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,902
neither a son of  chaebol nor an honorable family...

95
394
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:27,606
But an ordinary girl who was there to deliver laundry dry cleaning.

96
398
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,243
The sons of God who are exempt
from college entrance by way of wealth!!!

97
403
00:10:31,243 --> 00:10:33,445
If you guys have nothing to do...you should try taking the SAT!!!

98
407
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:36,982
If  such a thing should come from privilege, it deserves capital punishment! Shin Hwa group.. should blow itself up!

99
411
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:42,667
As a parent, I can't forgive them. 
I refuse to continue shopping at Shin Hwa Mart!

100
416
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:47,521
Shin Hwa Group, give us an explanation!
Give us an explanation!  Give us an explanation!!!

101
421
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:51,079
Shin Hwa Group, give us an explanation!
Give us an explanation!  Give us an explanation!

102
426
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:53,149
Abolish the elite education system!!

103
430
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:59,572
I am here now where people are protesting against the Shin Hwa Group and they are demanding honest answers about bullying at the elitist schools.

104
434
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:01,427
Now, let's hear the opinion from one of the protesters.

105
438
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,545
Hello, what brought you out here today?!

106
442
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:08,796
My friend was also heavily bullied
and he dropped out of school....

107
447
00:11:08,796 --> 00:11:14,168
That sort of thing can happen because of the unbearable stress of the entrance exams, but at a place like this they shouldn't have to suffer those kinds of hardships.

108
451
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,487
Jan Di, do you know what your nickname is?!

109
455
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:25,842
Common hero, Wonder Girl... You are our generation's true Wonder Woman.

110
459
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:29,064
Geum Jan Di Laundry, fighting!
Send the Wonder Girl to Shin Hwa High school!.

111
464
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:32,582
Stop it!!

112
468
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:34,567
Cool.

113
472
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:38,492
By the way, the Flower 4,

114
476
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:41,275
are they really so doll-faced?

115
480
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:44,703
I wish I could see them, up close, in person..

116
484
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,578
Flower 4?

117
488
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:51,621
What flower 4? Fly 4 makes more sense,

118
492
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,541
four dung flies.

119
496
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,196
Miss Jan Di, please look over here!!

120
500
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:06,788
Miss, please say something.

121
504
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:15,730
Excuse me! 
Look here! 
Smile!

122
510
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:23,817
Is that school for gifted people?

123
514
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:28,843
It's neither a science school nor a foreign language school.  It's literally a school for the rich.

124
518
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:31,492
Doesn't Korea pursue a fair society?

125
522
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,473
That bourgeoisie school is....

126
526
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:00,810
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

127
530
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,625
The group PR department and related companies are trying their best to extinguish the public opinion.

128
534
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:08,882
Extinguish? Do you think this is being extinguished?

129
538
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:13,888
How do you let the reporters dare?!  
Dare to mention Joon Pyo's name?

130
543
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:15,191
I'm deeply ashamed.

131
547
00:13:16,614 --> 00:13:19,126
Do you know why public opinion
 is something to be wary of?

132
552
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:20,964
Because it is ignorant.

133
556
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:24,899
Once it goes berserk, it's unmanageable.

134
560
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,468
Reason or common sense doesn't work any more.

135
564
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:32,807
The one who set the fire should extinguish it.

136
568
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,746
Madam Chairman, the Prime Minister is on the line.

137
572
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:39,614
Yes, sir.

138
576
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:43,084
Yes,

139
580
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:45,023
it's getting interesting..

140
584
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:58,732
I was never cut out for hiding from the paparazzi!

141
588
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:01,623
What a tough delivery!  Shoot!

142
592
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:06,286
I'm really sick and tired of this Shin Hwa 
school or F4 something..

143
597
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,154
I'm ho . . .

144
601
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:23,324
She's here!  
Jan Di!

145
606
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:25,599
Say hello to him.

146
610
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:29,464
He came from the Shin Hwa Chairman's office.

147
614
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:35,036
So I finally meet the famous wonder girl.
 Nice to meet you.

148
619
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:38,734
I didn't push him.

149
623
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:42,544
Really, I didn't.  F4 or something, they did.

150
627
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:43,444
That's not it.

151
631
00:14:43,444 --> 00:14:48,423
Jan Di, my daughter, just calm down and listen.

152
635
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:53,120
Starting tomorrow, you will attend Shin Hwa High .

153
639
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,757
You're in!

154
643
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:58,558
What the heck are you?!

155
647
00:14:58,558 --> 00:14:59,294
To tell the truth,

156
651
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:04,599
the Chairman has come to admire you and she decided to accept you as a special scholarship student!

157
655
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,267
SHE DECIDED TO ACCEPT YOU!

158
659
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:09,003
Scholarship student? Why me?

159
663
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:10,338
We would like you, Geum Jan Di...

160
667
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:12,573
Noona, you know how you used to swim back in middle school?

161
671
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:16,511
She wants you to swim again! SWIM AGAIN!

162
675
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:18,746
I don't want to!

163
679
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:22,116
What?

164
683
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:22,850
And why not?

165
687
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,218
Noona, are you crazy?

166
691
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,173
I like the way things are now.

167
695
00:15:29,173 --> 00:15:33,160
I wouldn't fit into the school and
I don't want to go to that school either.

168
700
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,629
You should probably go.

169
704
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:40,368
Jan Di, why don't you think about it a litt...

170
708
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:44,072
There's no need to think about anything.
She will be there tomorrow.

171
713
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:45,173
Shut up!

172
717
00:15:48,143 --> 00:15:50,044
Jan  Di: Why not?
Mom: Shut up!

173
722
00:15:57,551 --> 00:15:58,920
Then, I'll see you at school tomorrow.

174
726
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,190
Yes, even if I have to drag her by the neck,
I will make sure she's at school tomorrow.

175
731
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,391
Okay then.

176
735
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:11,132
Mr. Secretary,

177
739
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:16,003
you are aware of the phrase "Nak Jang Bool Ip."? "What's done cannot be undone.", right?

178
743
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,429
MOM!

179
747
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:45,533
Be quiet and just take a look at this!

180
751
00:16:50,271 --> 00:17:00,347
Shin Hwa High!  Shin Hwa High!  
Shin Hwa High!

181
756
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:01,715
Noona,

182
760
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:04,852
I really didn't think this day would come in my lifetime.

183
764
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:08,723
For the first time in my life, I am proud to be your brother.

184
768
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:14,227
Dad!  Wooooohhh!

185
772
00:17:14,227 --> 00:17:17,030
How can the words, "I'm not going" even
come out of your mouth?

186
777
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,267
Do you even know how much the tuition is?

187
781
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:22,336
No. I still don't want to.

188
785
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:23,771
I still don't want to go. Mom, I really don't want to.

189
789
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:25,074
Oh my!

190
793
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:29,577
Others study hard, have the money, and they still aren't able to get in. Why wouldn't you want to go?

191
797
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:34,982
Isn't it you who's always saying that those people only 
know how to brag about their wealth?

192
802
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:40,921
It, it, it was jealousy.

193
806
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:47,728
The truth is, it's like winning the lottery. Who wouldn't be happy?

194
810
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:51,665
I don't care. I have a bad feeling about this.

195
814
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:58,139
Just to let you know, regardless of
what you say, I'm not going.

196
819
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:05,746
But, you like to swim.

197
823
00:18:06,414 --> 00:18:09,884
You said you wanted to go to a school with a swimming pool.

198
827
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:16,957
Are you trying to get me to go to that school by saying they have a swimming pool?

199
831
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:20,194
I"m not going.  I don't want to.  I'll never go!

200
835
00:18:37,611 --> 00:18:38,446
Wait!

201
839
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:41,816
Just wait a minute, miss!

202
843
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,169
I'll go and come back.
(A Korean saying when they leave the house etc.)

203
848
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:03,304
Geum Jan Di, fighting!!!

204
852
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:06,874
Go on..

205
856
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:16,250
Dry cleaning is here,
dryyyy cleaningggg!

206
861
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,988
Jan Di dryyyyyyy cleaningggg!!

207
865
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:33,310
Dry cleaning is hereeee!
Jan Di dryyyyyy cleaningggg!!

208
870
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:18,946
Isn't it pretty?
Yeah, it is.

209
875
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:28,255
There were only two made imported from Japan.
I got myself one, guess who bought the other?

210
880
00:20:28,255 --> 00:20:29,089
Who?

211
884
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,159
Goo Joon Pyo.

212
888
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,660
That's really cool!

213
892
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,410
Don't you think my style is a lot better?

214
896
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,645
Hey, let me borrow it.

215
900
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:37,813
Hey, me too, 
me too!

216
905
00:20:55,497 --> 00:20:57,633
Just where is it?

217
909
00:22:26,988 --> 00:22:33,362
Uhhmm, do you know where the swimming pool is?

218
913
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:41,303
Oh, that way?  Thank you.

219
917
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:45,740
I'm so sorry for interrupting. 
You can continue on.

220
922
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:51,280
Goodbye!

221
926
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:13,368
AH!  It's F4!  AHHHH!

222
930
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:28,917
Move it!

223
934
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,381
Is something wrong?

224
938
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:34,816
I will give you to a count of three.

225
942
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,862
What? 
What for?

226
947
00:24:37,862 --> 00:24:40,888
Three...

227
951
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:43,292
Two...

228
955
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:44,793
One...

229
959
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:54,369
Hey, Woo Bin, do you have some juice left?

230
963
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:57,773
Yes, you want it?

231
967
00:25:27,503 --> 00:25:30,739
Hey, are you okay?

232
971
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:44,485
What kind of crazy person is that?!

233
975
00:25:44,485 --> 00:25:49,425
Why didn't anyone say anything?
How can they just stand there?

234
980
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:52,427
Oh my god.

235
984
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:55,630
Watch your mouth.

236
988
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:58,667
Who are you guys?

237
992
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:03,705
Us?  
By the way, sorry for the late greeting.

238
997
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:08,176
We are... Ginger!

239
1001
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:09,544
Sunny!

240
1005
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:11,246
Miranda!

241
1009
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:13,782
We are the Jin, Sun, Mi (the true, the 
good and the beautiful) of Shin Hwa High School.

242
1014
00:26:16,018 --> 00:26:25,848
What you were saying before, it wasn't
regarding the F4 was it transfer student?

243
1019
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:29,598
F, F what?

244
1023
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:35,537
So that guy who made a scene
is a member of the notorious F4?

245
1028
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:37,072
Notorious?!

246
1032
00:26:38,073 --> 00:26:40,075
You mean famous.

247
1036
00:26:40,075 --> 00:26:43,945
If you're not careful with what you say, you'll be in big trouble!

248
1040
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,685
I hear your family owns a laundromat.

249
1044
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:55,190
It's not a laundromat. It's a dry cleaners.

250
1048
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:57,926
So, what?

251
1052
00:26:57,926 --> 00:27:02,731
This is my first time seeing a dry cleaner's daughter.

252
1056
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:05,767
It's very fascinating.

253
1060
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:12,474
Look all you want, 
I won't charge you.

254
1065
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:21,883
Since this is your first day of school and you're a commoner who knows nothing of the world, I'll let you off this time.

255
1069
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:22,984
What?

256
1073
00:27:22,984 --> 00:27:25,854
For the things you said about the F4!

257
1077
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:30,425
What? 
Are they that remarkable?

258
1082
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:37,132
Hey transfer student, you really don't
know a thing about the F4 do you?

259
1087
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:40,302
No, I don't.

260
1091
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:50,979
Girls, 
let's go.

261
1096
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:10,265
Song Woo Bin, the son of Il Sim Construction,
also known as the blue-chip stock of the construction industry.

262
1101
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:14,769
They are real estate tycoons. People say
half of Jejudo belongs to Il-Sim.

263
1106
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:19,608
They're the head family of Il Sim Pa,
an organization(gang) of 50 years history.

264
1111
00:28:19,608 --> 00:28:23,111
They still have quite a few high-class clubs and saloons.

265
1115
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:27,782
When it comes to cash mobilization,
they are valued as King Wang Jjang.

266
1120
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:35,957
So Yee Jung is a genius ceramic artist who debuted at Biennale at the age of 16 as the youngest artist..

267
1124
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:39,361
He is one of the young artists to be selected by UNESCO.

268
1128
00:28:41,563 --> 00:28:45,400
There is at least one who made it on his own.

269
1132
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,403
Cast away the prejudice that genius would be poor.

270
1136
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:55,743
You know the cultural assets independence fighter,
 So Yoon He, in Korean History textbooks?
He is the owner of Woo Song Museum and the grandfather of F4 So Yi Jung.

271
1142
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:57,712
Woo Song Museum?!

272
1146
00:28:57,712 --> 00:29:01,215
Do you mean it's his family's? How rich are they?

273
1150
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:03,952
Don't imagine. 
You'll hurt yourself.

274
1155
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,395
That's a picture of the old president (of Korea).

275
1159
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:17,499
Look at this kid sitting next to him.

276
1163
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:20,835
He is F4's very own Yoon Ji Hoo.

277
1167
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:25,607
The son and daughter-in-law of
 President Yoon Seok Young  
died in a mysterious traffic accident.
The only survivor was his five year old grandson.

278
1174
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:30,379
You mean Yoon Ji Hoo is the grandson of President Yoon Seok Young?

279
1178
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:33,381
You know Soo Am Art Center where Jang Young Joo played?

280
1182
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:39,120
He owns the Soo Am Art Foundation, a soccer team in Europe and a Major League baseball team..

281
1186
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,990
I envy him most in the world.

282
1190
00:29:43,758 --> 00:29:46,628
You know him without my explanation, right?

283
1194
00:29:46,628 --> 00:29:54,369
This man is the F4 leader, Goo Joon Pyo. The successor of the great Shin Hwa group, whom even 3 year-old Korean kids know..

284
1198
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:03,113
F4 are those sort of guys? No way!

285
1202
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:08,252
Goo Joon Pyo, you are Goo Joong Mool (sewage)!!

286
1206
00:31:08,252 --> 00:31:12,723
F4, you flies!

287
1210
00:31:12,723 --> 00:31:17,494
If you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you should be thankful and be nice to people!

288
1214
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:24,634
It's annoying that someone like you is 
the successor of Shin Hwa group!!

289
1219
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:29,973
You better hope the two of us never come face to face.

290
1223
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:38,982
The day I have to call you "senior",
I will dive from the rooftop! Ahhhh!

291
1228
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:58,268
Yoon Ji Hoo!!!

292
1232
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:03,040
How noisy.

293
1236
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:07,577
It's so loud, I can't even sleep.

294
1240
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:11,248
I'm so sorry.  I thought no one was here.

295
1244
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:14,484
Is that really true?

296
1248
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:16,953
Eh?

297
1252
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:19,256
That you will dive?

298
1256
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:26,763
So, the thing is...

299
1260
00:32:26,763 --> 00:32:29,066
So you heard everything?

300
1264
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:30,467
About what?

301
1268
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,437
I mean...

302
1272
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:37,407
Goo Jung Mool (sewage)? 
Or flies?!

303
1277
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:51,654
Oh right, Joon Pyo...

304
1281
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:52,523
Huh?

305
1285
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:56,460
It's "Goo Joon Pyo," not "Goo JoongPyo"..

306
1289
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,765
Remembering the right name is the
least thing to do when you hate someone, right?

307
1294
00:33:20,283 --> 00:33:21,952
Rice balls!

308
1298
00:33:21,952 --> 00:33:23,587
You like them?

309
1302
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:24,021
What the heck are rice balls?

310
1306
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:26,823
It looks so pretty and delicious!

311
1310
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:41,271
What's that smell?

312
1314
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,039
It completely stinks!

313
1318
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:48,078
Oh, here it is.

314
1322
00:33:48,078 --> 00:33:52,949
Oh my God! 
 Terrible!

315
1327
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:59,156
Hey, transfer student, why are you eating such low grade food 
when there's an expensive spread over there?

316
1332
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,725
What?

317
1336
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:03,160
Then?

318
1340
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:11,001
Over $50 for one meal is a nuisance in my home.

319
1344
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:17,274
So, you're planning to keep eating these stinky lunch boxes?

320
1348
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:18,942
Yes I am.

321
1352
00:34:18,942 --> 00:34:20,610
God!

322
1356
00:34:37,394 --> 00:34:38,161
Good!

323
1360
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,797
It's F4! AH!

324
1364
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:44,400
Mi Sook, come on!!

325
1368
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,839
I'm going crazy!

326
1372
00:34:58,082 --> 00:35:04,120
Can I... try that?

327
1376
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:10,660
Welcome!

328
1380
00:35:11,995 --> 00:35:13,897
Thank you!!

329
1384
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:24,074
Is she from Germany?

330
1388
00:35:24,074 --> 00:35:29,045
Yeah, she looks really pretty.
I thought she was a doll or something.

331
1393
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,982
Anyway, it's great that you made a friend already.

332
1397
00:35:31,982 --> 00:35:35,719
I was worried you might be a loner.

333
1401
00:35:38,922 --> 00:35:40,390
I am a loner.

334
1405
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,391
What?

335
1409
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,026
I'm an outcast.

336
1413
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:48,598
But I'm thankful that I don't get noticed.

337
1417
00:35:48,598 --> 00:35:53,003
I'll stay a loner until the day I graduate.

338
1421
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:56,206
Who are you?

339
1425
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:59,942
What happened to our Jan Di?!

340
1429
00:35:59,942 --> 00:36:04,047
The one who protected me from
that wicked kindergarten owner's son,

341
1434
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:09,185
the one who fought against the gangs in junior high.
All of that was the work of the justice girl: Geum Jan Di..

342
1439
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:10,687
So what's wrong?

343
1443
00:36:10,687 --> 00:36:12,922
What can I do?

344
1447
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:18,427
I'd sooner get into it with my mother before causing
trouble and being expelled from school.

345
1452
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:21,862
You!
Ah!

346
1457
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:25,902
Do you think, do you think I'm wasting cucumbers?!

347
1461
00:36:25,902 --> 00:36:31,041
Your father wanted to eat cucumber kimchi
but I'm investing it in your face.

348
1466
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,810
What kind of investment are you doing with cucumbers?

349
1470
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,980
Won't this treatment give you beautiful skin?

350
1474
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,752
Even the worst boy in your school is the
super A plus when it comes to marriage material.

351
1479
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:46,556
It seems we've hit the  jackpot. Don't you think so, honey?

352
1483
00:36:46,556 --> 00:36:50,760
Don't disturb me. I'm artistically sharpening the edge.

353
1487
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,629
Mom, stop this!

354
1491
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:56,166
Look at you, look at you!

355
1495
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:58,602
Don't be so ungrateful!

356
1499
00:36:59,903 --> 00:37:02,905
And why are you ironing that?

357
1503
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:05,842
Your arms'll hurt because of ironing all day long.

358
1507
00:37:06,943 --> 00:37:11,681
15 years in the dry cleaning business 
and never once before have I seen such fine clothing.

359
1512
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:16,820
Ordinary people would be lucky
to wear such cloth even on their wedding day.

360
1517
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:18,321
Oh, boy!

361
1521
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:21,658
Sister, let me borrow it to wear on Sunday.

362
1525
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:28,965
Jan Di, when it comes to clothes like this,
you must treat them as kindly as your boss.

363
1530
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:31,034
Be careful when you sit and stand up.

364
1534
00:37:31,034 --> 00:37:34,504
Take good care of it and avoid any stains. Understand?

365
1538
00:37:36,473 --> 00:37:41,544
I'm ironing this beautiful thing for my daughter.
 There's no way my arms would hurt from that. 
No, daddy's totally fine.

366
1544
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,616
Oh my!

367
1548
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:53,356
That girl! 
 Honey, you should iron the lining too, right?

368
1553
00:37:58,395 --> 00:38:02,565
Justice Girl Geum Jan Di hasn't died yet.

369
1557
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:06,569
Outcast in this way, outcast in that way, and thrown about anyway!

370
1561
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:09,639
I will say what's on my mind!

371
1565
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:15,212
F4, from tomorrow, you're all dead!

372
1569
00:38:29,193 --> 00:38:31,127
It's F4!

373
1573
00:39:01,558 --> 00:39:07,797
Joon Pyo senior, I baked this myself for you..

374
1577
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:11,568
Please accept my heart.

375
1581
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:36,426
Our Joon Pyo only eats cakes made by a top-notch patissier.

376
1585
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:06,856
Who are you?

377
1589
00:40:09,392 --> 00:40:10,627
You have something to say?

378
1593
00:40:10,627 --> 00:40:14,430
Yes, I have something to say!  I have a lot to say!

379
1597
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:18,728
You!

380
1601
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,967
Do you have absolutely no respect for people?

381
1605
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:27,239
I don't even expect you to have humility as a rich person.

382
1609
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:30,709
If you didn't want to eat it, then you
 could have rejected it nicely or...

383
1614
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:34,946
Will it kill you to accept it by thinking of that person's effort?

384
1618
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:40,552
What are you going to do if she says she'll
jump off the roof, you bastard!

385
1623
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:42,821
Who are you?

386
1627
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,193
You have something to say?

387
1631
00:40:57,302 --> 00:40:58,770
No.

388
1635
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,600
Why are you swimming so hard? You'll become exhausted and faint.

389
1639
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:19,417
It's punishment.

390
1643
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:20,852
Punishment?

391
1647
00:42:21,753 --> 00:42:24,355
What did you do that was so bad?

392
1651
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:29,093
It's the punishment that the Justice Girl inflicts
upon the super obsequious.

393
1656
00:42:31,128 --> 00:42:33,831
So, do you feel better?

394
1660
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:35,934
Yes.

395
1664
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:40,238
All of the reasons why I'm going to this school are right here.

396
1668
00:42:41,606 --> 00:42:42,807
What are they?

397
1672
00:42:44,209 --> 00:42:49,414
The swimming pool  and Oh Min Ji.

398
1676
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:20,078
Senior!

399
1680
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:25,049
I'm so sorry, Joon Pyo senior.

400
1684
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:27,785
Sorry?

401
1688
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:35,559
If apologizing solved everything there wouldn't be laws and police officers.

402
1692
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:38,896
But it was an accident.

403
1696
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:41,099
I'll buy you the same exact shoes right away!

404
1700
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:44,535
You, are you richer than me?

405
1704
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:46,470
Pardon?

406
1708
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,039
Even if you had more money, it would be impossible.

407
1712
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,276
These shoes were made by a craftsman in Firenze,

408
1716
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:55,846
how could you possibly buy me the
exact same ones immediately?

409
1721
00:43:55,846 --> 00:44:01,152
I'm really sorry.  I'll do anything I can do to fix it.

410
1725
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:02,820
Anything?

411
1729
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,555
Yes!

412
1733
00:44:08,927 --> 00:44:10,628
Lick it.

413
1737
00:44:14,032 --> 00:44:15,199
Pardon?

414
1741
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:17,235
I said to lick it.

415
1745
00:44:21,173 --> 00:44:22,607
Senior.

416
1749
00:44:22,607 --> 00:44:25,076
Didn't you say you'ld do anything?

417
1753
00:44:31,249 --> 00:44:33,418
Isn't that enough?

418
1757
00:44:37,354 --> 00:44:41,693
You! You think she fell because she wanted to?

419
1761
00:44:41,693 --> 00:44:44,495
Apologizing is enough, don't you think?

420
1765
00:44:44,495 --> 00:44:46,598
Who's this nosy person?

421
1769
00:44:46,598 --> 00:44:51,736
Hey second year! I'm guessing it hasn't been
long since you returned (to Korea), but . . .

422
1774
00:44:51,736 --> 00:44:54,072
you shouldn't try to use the American style here.

423
1778
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:56,707
Why so informal?

424
1782
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:06,250
Oh, so you're the famous "Wonder Girl"?

425
1786
00:45:07,352 --> 00:45:11,890
People were saying Wonder Woman and stuff,
so I expected at least an "S" line and a "D" cup.

426
1791
00:45:14,459 --> 00:45:16,694
How homely!

427
1795
00:45:17,562 --> 00:45:20,164
So sorry to dissappoint you.

428
1799
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:23,734
Is it common for you to ignore your status and be so nosy?!

429
1803
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:25,470
Why are you butting into other people's business?

430
1807
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,805
She is my business. 
She's my friend..

431
1812
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:32,043
I guess in rich peoples' dictionaries there are
no words like "friend" or "friendship"?

432
1817
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:33,244
Friendship?

433
1821
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,216
Let's see this great friendship you speak about.

434
1825
00:45:41,586 --> 00:45:43,755
Lick it.

435
1829
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:47,992
What?!

436
1833
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:52,363
I'll forget all about this if you lick it instead.

437
1837
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:18,456
Hey!

438
1841
00:46:27,832 --> 00:46:29,701
What's up with you?

439
1845
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:37,107
Does she have more money than you?
Did you yourself earn all of that money?

440
1850
00:46:37,107 --> 00:46:41,012
What? Is it common for me to be so nosy?

441
1854
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,186
It's common for me not to overlook rich bastards who think it's okay to act out because they have wealthy families to bail them out. Why?!

442
1858
00:47:04,636 --> 00:47:09,573
At our place, it's $2.50, but I calculated
it by Kangnam standards, ok?

443
1863
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:12,744
If the stain still doesn't come out, then bring it by.

444
1867
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:22,054
<i>[Jan Di Cleaners, 300-5648]</i>

445
1871
00:47:30,962 --> 00:47:36,868
What the hell is that piece of crap?!

446
1875
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:07,866
What's the matter with Joon Pyo?!

447
1879
00:48:07,866 --> 00:48:12,870
I think he's still shocked from what happened today.
He just keeps throwing darts.

448
1884
00:48:25,683 --> 00:48:28,253
What's with that serious face?

449
1888
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:32,056
Don't bother me.  Can't you hear the wheels turning in my head?

450
1892
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:37,228
I'm thinking of the best way to completely crush
that little weed.

451
1897
00:48:39,964 --> 00:48:44,168
Why are you even bothering to think about her?
Just handle things the way you always do.

452
1902
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:52,510
Man! You really are smart!

453
1906
00:49:08,393 --> 00:49:13,664
Jan Di Cleaners, you're dead now.

454
1910
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:42,760
Look, look!

455
1914
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,631
Geum Jan Di of second year Class B drew an F4 red card!!

456
1918
00:49:50,635 --> 00:49:55,206
What is this, a soccer field?
What are they talking about a red card?

457
1923
00:49:56,007 --> 00:49:57,208
(What?)

458
1927
00:50:23,618 --> 00:50:28,455
Hello.   Hello, Crazy!

459
1931
00:50:28,455 --> 00:50:32,694
I guess your desk isn't here.

460
1935
00:50:32,694 --> 00:50:35,396
How can you study with us when you're a commoner?

461
1939
00:50:35,396 --> 00:50:37,398
Why did you even come to school?

462
1943
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,470
My book.
Hey, move over.

463
1948
00:50:48,743 --> 00:50:51,245
Get out of here! Annoying! Die! Go screw! Lick my froth!

464
1952
00:51:19,474 --> 00:51:22,543
You're dead today.

465
1956
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:44,332
<i>[F*** off! Screw you!]</i>

466
1960
00:51:51,105 --> 00:51:56,844
Who did this? If you have something
to say, then then say it to my face!

467
1965
00:51:56,844 --> 00:51:58,012
Who did it?

468
1969
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:20,835
Jan Di, when it comes to this kind of clothing, you must treat it as kindly as your boss.  Be careful with it at all times.

469
1973
00:52:23,771 --> 00:52:28,176
This great suit is my daughter's.
Why would my arms hurt? Daddy will be just fine.

470
1978
00:52:34,582 --> 00:52:39,153
Throw more! Throw more! Just try and throw more!

471
1982
00:53:01,676 --> 00:53:06,481
Hey, hey, hey. Someone bring some oil.
All we have to do now is to fry her.

472
1987
00:53:06,481 --> 00:53:09,150
What wil she be then? A pan fried pumpkin?

473
1991
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:21,562
Do more! Just try and do more!

474
1995
00:53:47,488 --> 00:53:49,624
Isn't it over now?

475
1999
00:53:49,624 --> 00:53:54,195
What do you mean over?
It'll be over when that commoner kneels before me.

476
2004
00:53:56,497 --> 00:53:59,934
So, that's why they say not to bother a sleeping wolf.

477
2008
00:54:01,202 --> 00:54:03,204
Don't you mean a lion?

478
2012
00:54:03,204 --> 00:54:05,839
It seems this time it won't even last a week.

479
2016
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:09,376
1 week? I say three days.

480
2020
00:54:09,376 --> 00:54:15,182
Yi Jung, you, if I win, then I get that traditional pot from your last show.

481
2024
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:19,120
For a fool that can't tell a pot from a water bottle, 
what's the sudden interest?

482
2029
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,525
My baby is a fan of the potter,  So Yi Jung..

483
2033
00:54:24,525 --> 00:54:28,563
Okay. If I win, then I get the number of the Super Girls.

484
2037
00:54:28,563 --> 00:54:29,696
Deal!

485
2041
00:54:29,696 --> 00:54:33,367
Hey guys shut up. It's almost time for her to show up.

486
2045
00:54:36,504 --> 00:54:45,880
Alright. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Jjang!

487
2049
00:54:51,919 --> 00:54:57,058
Ah, that's right. She's probably embarrassed to
show up in front of me in that disastrous state.

488
2054
00:54:57,058 --> 00:55:00,594
Yep, I was a bit hasty. One more time.

489
2058
00:55:02,863 --> 00:55:05,099
5,

490
2062
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:07,335
4,

491
2066
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,172
3,

492
2070
00:55:13,341 --> 00:55:15,810
2,

493
2074
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,015
1 . . .

494
2078
00:55:28,656 --> 00:55:32,526
What's wrong with you guys? Did you do it right?

495
2082
00:55:33,227 --> 00:55:35,262
Then, why isn't she here?

496
2086
00:55:36,097 --> 00:55:39,033
Where the hell did that chick go?

497
2090
00:55:40,868 --> 00:55:44,338
Surrender? You wish!

498
2094
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:49,109
I say Jan Di, and  you think
it's grass for you to walk all over?!

499
2099
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:51,979
You picked on the wrong person!

500
2103
00:55:51,979 --> 00:55:55,549
Have you guys ever eaten dough soup
that has been cooked with tears?

501
2108
00:55:55,549 --> 00:55:59,019
Have you ever seen a free pass to the public bath house?

502
2112
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:04,358
Commoners are nothing if not unyielding
and persevering! You should know that!

503
2117
00:56:09,464 --> 00:56:11,933
How many eggs did they just throw away?

504
2121
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:18,205
Those idiots don't even know how
precious flour is. What's wrong with them?!

505
2126
00:56:18,205 --> 00:56:20,540
So wasteful . . .

506
2130
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,844
How many pancakes could they have made with these?! Seriously!

507
2134
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:29,850
Oh my!

508
2138
00:56:30,885 --> 00:56:33,420
Who's there?

509
2142
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,690
You're really noisy every time I see you.

510
2146
00:56:41,662 --> 00:56:45,166
Do you know how to make pancakes?

511
2150
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:47,001
What?

512
2154
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:48,736
Pancakes.

513
2158
00:56:52,173 --> 00:57:02,784
All you have to do is mix flour, eggs,
milk, and sugar and fry it.

514
2163
00:57:02,784 --> 00:57:04,885
Just like Bindeadduk (korean pancake).

515
2167
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,922
That's simple.

516
2171
00:57:50,064 --> 00:57:52,599
Your handkerchief . . .

517
2175
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:54,769
I don't need it.

518
2179
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:57,271
I'll return it to you next time.

519
2183
00:57:58,606 --> 00:58:01,075
I won't be here again.

520
2187
00:58:02,276 --> 00:58:07,047
It's no longer quiet, thanks to someone.

521
2191
00:59:18,285 --> 00:59:21,255
I'm sorry, Jan Di...

522
2195
00:59:21,255 --> 00:59:26,360
Forgive me for being a coward.

523
2199
00:59:55,089 --> 00:59:57,691
I think it'll be at least $30.

524
2203
00:59:57,691 --> 01:00:02,441
Wow, I know the actual price.  That's not fair.

525
2207
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,376
The express service is a little bit more expensive.

526
2211
01:00:05,376 --> 01:00:09,847
Also, look at the condition of these clothes. 
I've already given you quite the discount
 only because it's a school uniform.

527
2217
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:16,386
Come on, really. I'm a junior of the dry cleaning business.

528
2221
01:00:16,386 --> 01:00:21,159
If you don't like the price, forget it.
Next door is Jan Di Dry Cleaner. Go there..

529
2226
01:00:23,227 --> 01:00:30,501
Cmon, Mister. Alright . . . $25!

530
2230
01:00:48,786 --> 01:00:50,855
Bon apetit !

531
2234
01:00:57,962 --> 01:01:01,899
Yo, yo, yo! What's up, man?!

532
2238
01:01:01,899 --> 01:01:05,703
They only accept one group per week here, so . . .

533
2242
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:10,641
I made reservations a month ago and I'm still waiting, so. . .

534
2246
01:01:10,641 --> 01:01:12,310
How did you do it?

535
2250
01:01:31,362 --> 01:01:33,297
This one is better.

536
2254
01:01:33,297 --> 01:01:37,768
You're right. It's a beauty.

537
2258
01:01:37,768 --> 01:01:40,205
Enough to make your cuisine even finer.

538
2262
01:01:40,205 --> 01:01:43,507
And just who told you that I was a chef?

539
2266
01:01:47,812 --> 01:01:51,249
Your... delicious-looking hands.

540
2270
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,630
Do players know things just by looking at a woman's hand?

541
2274
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:09,233
You need at least to know she's a chef
at Michelin in order to be a player.

542
2279
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:11,535
Of course. My bro, yo!

543
2283
01:02:25,716 --> 01:02:29,387
Yeah.  Are you doing what I told you to do?

544
2287
01:02:31,055 --> 01:02:35,326
Don't make a mistake and do it correctly. Understand?

545
2291
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:46,837
Let's eat.

546
2295
01:02:47,939 --> 01:02:52,576
Alright. Cheers!

547
2299
01:02:59,851 --> 01:03:01,018
Hey!!

548
2303
01:03:01,018 --> 01:03:02,053
Mom!

549
2307
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:05,890
You must be crazy! Everyone
is dying to lose weight, but,

550
2312
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:08,459
here you are stuffing your face?!

551
2316
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:10,995
Will you be happy if I die doing such a worthless thing?

552
2320
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:16,734
Hey! You need to diet and at least have a
killer body so the rich boys will notice you!

553
2325
01:03:16,734 --> 01:03:20,671
Really! We're not rich nor do we have a good
family background nor are we smart!

554
2330
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,673
What are you talking about? Dieting is worthless?!

555
2334
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,408
Give me the rice container!

556
2338
01:03:24,408 --> 01:03:28,879
No, I can't. Right now, surviving is
more important than dieting to me.

557
2343
01:03:28,879 --> 01:03:34,685
Hey! In this day and age, even swimmers
must be skinny to become stars!

558
2348
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:39,690
Haven't you seen Kim Yoo Na? You're a young girl, how can you not know the trends?

559
2352
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,092
Give me the rice container!

560
2356
01:03:41,092 --> 01:03:43,060
(Mom! I said, I don't want to!)

561
2360
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,695
Give it to me!

562
2364
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:45,996
Hey, you!

563
2368
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:48,899
Mom, Kim Yoo Na is a figure skater.

564
2372
01:03:48,899 --> 01:03:52,303
Kim Yoo Na is a figure skater, not a swimmer!

565
2376
01:03:52,303 --> 01:03:54,638
Stop! You!

566
2380
01:03:55,206 --> 01:04:00,044
Hey! Give up the rice container!

567
2384
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,948
Hey!

568
2388
01:04:03,948 --> 01:04:09,653
Jan Di? Jan Di? The rice container . . .  Jan Di?!

569
2392
01:04:23,334 --> 01:04:25,069
Has my stomach gotten bigger?

570
2396
01:04:27,372 --> 01:04:29,440
A little bit.

571
2400
01:04:30,775 --> 01:04:33,677
I'm sorry. I haven't been able to take care of you.

572
2404
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,983
I'm only putting up with this because of the swimming pool.

573
2408
01:04:38,983 --> 01:04:43,687
If I had attended this kind of school from the get-go,
there's no doubt I would have been in the Olympics.

574
2413
01:04:43,687 --> 01:04:45,089
No doubt at all.

575
2417
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:18,422
What the?  What is this? Goo Joon Pyo!

576
2421
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,464
Hey! What's going on?  You keep on smiling to yourself.

577
2425
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:29,934
She's probably really pissed right about now.

578
2429
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:31,135
Who?

579
2433
01:05:32,269 --> 01:05:36,073
Perhaps, the laundry girl? Still?

580
2437
01:05:36,073 --> 01:05:39,043
Wait a minute, how long has it been?

581
2441
01:05:39,043 --> 01:05:41,111
It's been over a week.

582
2445
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:45,449
Okay, hand them over, the girls' phone numbers.

583
2449
01:05:45,449 --> 01:05:47,051
She's really something.

584
2453
01:05:47,051 --> 01:05:52,356
Wait, isn't she the first girl to really face off with the F4?

585
2457
01:05:52,356 --> 01:05:56,560
What are you saying?
It's only because I'm going easy on her.

586
2462
01:05:57,895 --> 01:05:59,597
But, how come Ji Hoo's not here again?!

587
2466
01:05:59,597 --> 01:06:02,266
He's probably sleeping somewhere.

588
2470
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:51,770
We will see you next time.

589
2474
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:58,750
.

590
2478
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:04,260
.
