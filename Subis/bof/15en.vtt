1
3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,295
That looks so delicious.

2
7
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:59,186
Do you want me to buy it for you? 
 Yes.

3
12
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,532
 Where'd it go?

4
16
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,401
Don't worry about it.  I have enough money for this.

5
20
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:12,285
How much is it? 
 6 for $30.

6
25
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,577
Oh..

7
29
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:21,671
Where are you from? 
Korea.

8
34
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:23,949
What a lovely honeymoon couple you make. 
 Huh?

9
39
00:01:26,895 --> 00:01:29,588
This is a freebie. 
  Oh, thank you.

10
44
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,368
Welcome.

11
48
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:34,866
Thank you.

12
52
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:37,841
It's delicious. 
 Thank you.

13
57
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:38,860
Bye Bye.

14
61
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:50,252
What is this?

15
65
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:56,313
Can I ask, what this is?

16
69
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:59,290
This is a good luck dragon charm that brings good luck.

17
73
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:04,950
He says it is a good luck dragon charm. 
 A charm?

18
78
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,001
Ah!  I'll have to buy it.

19
82
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:18,778
Uh...my wallet!

20
86
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:21,312
What am I going to do?

21
90
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,387
Ah... 
 Wait here for a minute.

22
95
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:27,999
Ji Hoo sunbae

23
99
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:37,982
Hi, I'm so sorry.  Can I borrow your guitar?

24
103
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:43,946
Why? You want to play? 
 I am sorry, I will pay you with my egg tarts.

25
108
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:47,068
Can I borrow your guitar just once? 
Okay.

26
113
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:49,814
Okay.  Thank you.

27
117
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,692
Thank you.
Sure.

28
122
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:15,333
I thought of this as I was looking at you . . . (song lyrics)

29
126
00:04:15,333 --> 00:05:45,244
Yo can still come back to me. Can you not see me in you?

30
130
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:00,633
This amount . . .

31
134
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:02,566
should be more than enough, right?

32
138
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,762
This shoe must have gotten sick of Macau.

33
142
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:50,657
It's not going to work.  I guess I'll have to take them off.

34
146
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:58,016
Let's go. 
 Get on my back.

35
151
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:01,893
Eh? 
 Or would you rather I carried you in my arms?

36
156
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:06,827
Uh, that is, um, okay.

37
160
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:19,553
Thank you 
Thank you.

38
165
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:23,745
What do you have to be thankful for, Sunbae?  I'm the one who's grateful.

39
169
00:07:23,745 --> 00:07:28,146
That was the first time in my life that I've gotten to earn money on my own.

40
173
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,182
Oh...

41
177
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:34,820
I'm doing all kinds of things for the first time, because of you.

42
181
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,290
So, thank you.

43
185
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,700
Shall we go ahead and turn back?

44
189
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,746
Stay a little longer.

45
193
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,864
Young master.

46
197
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:46,023
Go now.

47
201
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:57,629
Oh, the door wasn't locked.

48
205
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,043
Geum JanDi,

49
209
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,720
Hurry up in there.

50
213
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,756
Are you really going to do that all that all day?

51
217
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:35,780
Fine. Then I'm going to go somewhere for a little bit.

52
221
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:49,689
I'm gonna go out so . . .

53
225
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:51,416
come out and eat.

54
229
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,903
Memory deleted. :)

55
233
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:07,614
Departure at 18:00 to Seoul.

56
237
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,041
*Goo JoonPyo*

57
241
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:53,034
Huh! First?! 
 Is this really first class?

58
246
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:54,134
Yeah.

59
250
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:59,456
How expensive. I can just fly "Economy". Please exchange it for me.

60
254
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:01,389
Economy?

61
258
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:09,408
Do you mean economy, by any chance?

62
262
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:14,084
My legs are too long (uncomfortable) so I can't ride economy.

63
266
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:18,713
What?

64
270
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:23,776
His legs are long, really long.

65
274
00:15:24,732 --> 00:15:27,851
I can take economy, though.

66
278
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:34,140
It's not easy meeting with JaeKyung.

67
282
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:40,142
She's always bouncing around from east to had just gotten back from HongKong.

68
286
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:43,759
I'm so sorry that you have to wait so long when you're so busy.

69
290
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:50,133
Oh, not at all.  Can there be anything more important than for the two children to meet?

70
294
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:54,522
Don't you think so, Joonpyo?

71
298
00:15:57,864 --> 00:15:59,354
Goo JoonPyo?

72
302
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,377
Yes?

73
306
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:07,452
Ah, yes.  That's right.

74
310
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,180
What's the problem? 
 The Singapore branch 
urgently needs the young master.

75
316
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,498
Do you know what an important meeting this is?

76
320
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:16,217
The prime minister . . .

77
324
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:20,469
It's all right.  I'm sure they'll get to meet soon.

78
328
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:24,301
Is there anything more important for a businessman than business?

79
332
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,227
Go ahead and leave.

80
336
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:30,298
Then, I'll be excused.

81
340
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:20,386
What's this?

82
344
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:22,876
Is it to your liking?

83
348
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:28,589
How did this come about?

84
352
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:33,260
I wanted to buy you something with the first money that I earned myself.

85
356
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,196
Sunbae

86
360
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,491
Why did you come?

87
364
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:06,631
I have no need to answer you.

88
368
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,214
And you?  What are you doing?

89
372
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,235
Do you think you have the right to ask that kind of question?

90
376
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:20,845
Yoon JiHoo! 
  Because you were my friend, I gave in to you. 
 Because she was my friend's girl, I let her go.

91
382
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:26,474
And I gave you every opportunity, until the very end.

92
386
00:18:26,474 --> 00:18:28,649
I'm not going to tolerate it any longer.

93
390
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:32,727
Stop it.

94
394
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:40,878
Why did you come?

95
398
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:47,043
Do you have something to say?

96
402
00:18:57,745 --> 00:19:00,380
Ok. I understand.

97
406
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:05,981
I'll go.

98
410
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:12,185
Young master,  please get up.

99
414
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:03,537
The porridge's ready . . .

100
418
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:12,906
Please enjoy your food.

101
422
00:21:15,683 --> 00:21:19,972
Miss, it's not what we ordered.

102
426
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:23,829
I'm sorry miss, I'll bring your order in a minute.

103
430
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:26,651
I'm sorry.

104
434
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:40,240
I'm sorry.

105
438
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,042
I'm sorry.

106
442
00:21:49,936 --> 00:21:52,045
GaEul,

107
446
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:55,174
I am really pathetic, aren't I?            .

108
450
00:21:55,174 --> 00:22:01,057
I need to get my act together and think carefully about what I am going to do in the future...

109
454
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:04,819
Instead, I'm always causing problems.

110
458
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:10,744
JanDi. Run an errand for me.

111
462
00:22:10,744 --> 00:22:13,858
I'll go.  I'll take her place.  Where is it?

112
466
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:16,630
JanDi, you go.

113
470
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,658
Go give it to him, and until he's completely finished

114
474
00:22:19,658 --> 00:22:23,265
stay right at his side; then bring the thermos back, got it?

115
478
00:22:23,265 --> 00:22:26,605
Don't even think of coming back, until he completely finishes eating.

116
482
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:02,209
Your blood pressure is fine.

117
486
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:04,737
Say "Ah" please. 
 "Ah"

118
491
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:12,458
Hey you, standing out there!

119
495
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:17,047
Who me? 
 Instead of just standing there, 
come in here and assist me.

120
501
00:23:17,949 --> 00:23:19,538
Aren't you going to hurry up and come?

121
505
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:22,115
Can't you see all these patients waiting?

122
509
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:39,199
Isn't it cold? Here you go.

123
513
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:41,307
Have some.

124
517
00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:46,174
Oh, thank you. 
  Yes.

125
522
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:49,805
Here. Where are you looking?

126
526
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:10,990
See this! See this! What's this?

127
530
00:24:12,037 --> 00:24:12,772
What's this?

128
534
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:10,629
Hey, why are you sleeping here? Go home!

129
538
00:25:17,523 --> 00:25:19,171
Here.

130
542
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,958
I can't go home until you have finished everything.

131
546
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,783
Please eat.

132
550
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:46,842
By the way, grandfather,

133
554
00:25:46,842 --> 00:25:49,767
What do you do?

134
558
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,604
How do you know our Master?

135
562
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,970
Grandpa, you are a doctor, aren't you?

136
566
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,385
By chance . . . illegally?

137
570
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,471
So does that mean I look like a quack?

138
574
00:26:17,362 --> 00:26:18,781
A little.

139
578
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,304
Ah! Doctor.  Oh, my stomach!

140
582
00:26:25,304 --> 00:26:29,308
Doctor, my stomach hurts.

141
586
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:37,250
Here, here, be careful.  Just hang in there.

142
590
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,945
So you do still come here.

143
594
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:25,464
Sunbae!

144
598
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:42,981
Has something good happened?

145
602
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:47,352
How did you know?

146
606
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:51,623
It's all written right here.

147
610
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:03,168
Hold on tightly to that hand.

148
614
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:07,005
Push one more time.

149
618
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:09,708
Almost done.  Just a little more.

150
622
00:28:11,643 --> 00:28:15,947
It's done. You did it.

151
626
00:28:23,026 --> 00:28:24,744
Here, you did a great job!

152
630
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:33,262
Oh, my baby is born.

153
634
00:28:33,262 --> 00:28:34,440
Oh! You did a great job!

154
638
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,413
The baby's here.

155
642
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:39,421
Beautiful, right?

156
646
00:28:42,695 --> 00:28:45,532
Goose bumps broke out all over my body.

157
650
00:28:45,532 --> 00:28:49,190
Like I learned about a new world I didn't know about until yesterday.

158
654
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:54,262
It was first time I didn't think about JoonPyo or swimming.

159
658
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:59,095
If I ever told anyone they'd probably think I was crazy,

160
662
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,528
to think somene as stupid as I am would want to becme a doctor.

161
666
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:05,407
They'd all laugh at me wouldn't they?

162
670
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:06,531
Geum JanDi.

163
674
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,568
You've gone crazy, haven't you?

164
678
00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:13,149
Completely crazy!

165
682
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:28,153
It's pretty difficult to find something you like so much that other people would call you crazy for.

166
686
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:31,456
You know that, right?

167
690
00:29:32,124 --> 00:29:35,529
It doesn't matter what other people say.

168
694
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:39,931
Since when did Geum Jandi concern herself with that?

169
698
00:29:44,036 --> 00:29:45,419
Sunbae.

170
702
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,359
If you want to do it, then you should just do it.

171
706
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,844
No matter how many years it takes? 
 Yes, no matter how many years it takes.

172
711
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:56,329
For Geum JanDi's new dream,

173
715
00:29:57,816 --> 00:30:00,018
Cheers!

174
719
00:31:01,545 --> 00:31:05,150
Please just say a word about . . .

175
723
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,591
We'll give an official announcement . . .

176
727
00:31:09,891 --> 00:31:13,791
The flight of Shinhwa Group begins now.

177
731
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:15,260
Watch us.

178
735
00:31:49,628 --> 00:31:50,862
JanDi?

179
739
00:31:53,331 --> 00:31:54,899
It is you.

180
743
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:09,681
Here.  So you went to Macau?

181
747
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:13,618
Uh, actually . . .

182
751
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:22,853
I felt I needed to close the chapter on Goo Joonpyo, so that I could get on with my life.

183
755
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,719
I think it was good that I went.

184
759
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:29,462
I've completely put it behind me now.

185
763
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:37,533
I . . . was really hoping that you'd stick right by JoonPyo's side.

186
767
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:40,381
It's so pitiful.

187
771
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:46,232
Without any regard to JoonPyo, you can still consider me your "unni" (big sister), right?

188
775
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:49,402
Yes.

189
779
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,378
Of course.

190
783
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,706
Argh!  What's going on?

191
787
00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:13,819
How is it that you're the star and I'm the moon?

192
791
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:21,095
Because Geum JanDi, the moon, can never get away from Goo JoonPyo, the star.

193
795
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:32,746
Because no matter what happens, I'll never let go of this moon.

194
799
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:26,375
It's okay. Don't hold back.  Just cry.  You can just let it all out. hmmm?

195
803
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:29,170
Un-nie

196
807
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:33,924
I lied. I'm not fine.

197
811
00:36:36,335 --> 00:36:38,862
I went because I missed Goo JoonPyo, but . . .

198
815
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:44,217
I can't believe that he could have changed

199
819
00:36:44,217 --> 00:36:46,333
into a totally different person.

200
823
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:50,826
JanDi.

201
827
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:14,105
Jandi, thank you.

202
831
00:37:14,105 --> 00:37:18,280
I'm truly happy that you've told me this.

203
835
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,617
Listen to me carefully.

204
839
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:28,573
Joonpyo will definitely come back to you, so don't give up on him just like that.

205
843
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:32,634
Trust me, and give him one more chance.

206
847
00:37:32,634 --> 00:37:36,250
You can do that, can't you?

207
851
00:38:15,898 --> 00:38:17,604
Miss Gaeul...

208
855
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:40,092
An invitation to JoonPyo sunbae's birthday party?

209
859
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:43,936
Yeah. 
 And you want me to take Jandi there?

210
864
00:38:45,631 --> 00:38:48,907
Why?  Why would I do that?

211
868
00:38:48,907 --> 00:38:55,146
JoonPyo sunbae, no,  that person,
you said he dumped JanDi.

212
873
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:58,494
Yes, but there's something that's still bothering me.

213
877
00:38:58,494 --> 00:39:01,281
We'll just say it's to confirm something.

214
881
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:04,181
But if things go wrong, the one who will be hurt is Jandi.

215
885
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:07,371
GaEul, listen carefully.

216
889
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:11,389
If JoonPyo's dumping JanDi was an act, then all the better, but . . .

217
893
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:15,492
even if it was all real, then it's still something Jandi needs.

218
897
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:18,391
And it's not just killing her twice?

219
901
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:24,502
When someone needs to be erased from your memory, then it needs to be done right.

220
905
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:26,280
Didn't I teach you that before?

221
909
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,194
What is all this?

222
913
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:56,068
If you're going to battle, you need armor, don't you?

223
917
00:40:09,464 --> 00:40:11,124
Ah, I don't want to.

224
921
00:40:11,124 --> 00:40:12,684
Why would I go?

225
925
00:40:12,684 --> 00:40:14,753
Are you really never going to see him again?

226
929
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:17,193
Is it okay to end it like this?

227
933
00:40:17,193 --> 00:40:22,261
He is here in Seoul.  And it's his birthday.  You could just congratulate him, couldn't you?

228
937
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:26,466
Do you really have nothing you want to say to Joonpyo sunbae?

229
941
00:40:29,702 --> 00:40:32,137
The thing that upsets me the most . . .

230
945
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:40,337
is not that he acted like he didn't know me, or that he didn't hold onto me till the end.

231
949
00:40:45,217 --> 00:40:50,689
I couldn't even tell him "thank you". I couldn't even tell him "I like you.".

232
953
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:56,595
The things that can't be done a second time.

233
957
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:03,201
Welco . . .

234
961
00:41:06,468 --> 00:41:08,773
Hello Geum JanDi.

235
965
00:41:08,773 --> 00:41:10,300
Hello.

236
969
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,881
What brings you here? 
Today, there is a birthday party for Young Master.

237
974
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:21,149
By any chance, did Goo JoonPyo send you here?

238
978
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:22,122
No.

239
982
00:41:30,706 --> 00:41:34,881
The Chairman wishes for you to attend.

240
986
00:41:37,435 --> 00:41:39,538
The Chairman?

241
990
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:57,764
It's the F4!

242
994
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:28,988
You came.

243
998
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:38,263
I didn't want to run away, so I did come, but, I can't help thinking it was in vain.

244
1002
00:42:38,964 --> 00:42:42,564
Geum Jandi, since you're here, you may as well have something to eat before you go.

245
1006
00:42:49,707 --> 00:42:51,476
Geum JanDi's nothing if not loyal, isn't that right?

246
1010
00:42:53,015 --> 00:42:54,444
Don't you agree, GaEul?

247
1014
00:43:46,117 --> 00:43:50,586
Today, on behalf of  my son, JoonPyo, and I,

248
1018
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:57,717
thank you for coming to congratulate ShinHwa.   I really thank you for coming.

249
1022
00:44:00,296 --> 00:44:05,501
As you all know,

250
1026
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:08,897
Our ability to overcome these difficult times

251
1030
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:15,542
Is all thanks to everyone here.

252
1034
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:20,895
From now until the day that ShinHwa becomes the world's best,

253
1038
00:44:20,895 --> 00:44:26,977
I wish that you will still support us.

254
1042
00:44:26,977 --> 00:44:29,958
So I will introduce to you the host for today.

255
1046
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:35,307
ShinHwa Group's future.  Everyone, my son, Goo JoonPyo.

256
1050
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:28,858
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you
Happy Birthday to JoonPyo.
Happy birthday to you

257
1057
00:46:20,012 --> 00:46:21,503
Are you okay?

258
1061
00:46:24,055 --> 00:46:28,130
I think, I should go soon.

259
1065
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:33,458
I shouldn't have come.

260
1069
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,450
Long time no see, Miss Geum JanDi.

261
1073
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,362
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

262
1077
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:41,456
Invitation?

263
1081
00:46:41,456 --> 00:46:46,938
Since you are here, can I ask you to wish a happy birthday to JoonPyo?

264
1085
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,751
P..pardon?

265
1089
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:56,551
I understand you are an intelligent young lady raised by parents who value proper education.

266
1093
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:03,003
Would it be rude of me to ask you to play the piano for us tonight?

267
1097
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:04,393
No way.

268
1101
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,316
Does Geum JanDi know how to play the piano?

269
1105
00:47:08,316 --> 00:47:12,485
- She doesn't, right?
 - I did wonder why she invited her.

270
1110
00:47:12,485 --> 00:47:14,549
She's really something!

271
1114
00:47:17,115 --> 00:47:20,896
My friend and I were just about to . . . 
I'll do it.

272
1119
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:26,670
It's the least I can do to pay for my meal tonight.

273
1123
00:47:27,503 --> 00:47:29,104
I will do it.

274
1127
00:47:56,465 --> 00:48:03,006
Everyone, Geum JanDi from ShinHwa High school is going to play us a song on the piano.

275
1131
00:48:54,256 --> 00:49:08,079
The moment you stood next to me, 
 I liked the ways your eyes looked (at me).

276
1136
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:22,262
Though I cried yesterday,
today because of you,
my tomorrow will be happy.

277
1142
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:31,431
His face...

278
1146
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:53,186
Neither his face nor his style,
I just needed his tender love.

279
1151
00:49:53,186 --> 00:50:19,757
To forget all the time that has passed.
Without you, I cannot... (do anything)

280
1156
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:39,140
Nothing but love . . . 
I know nothing but love.

281
1161
00:51:04,557 --> 00:51:05,628
Woo!

282
1165
00:51:25,186 --> 00:51:30,111
By making an unexpected request, I'm afraid, I ruined the party atmosphere.

283
1169
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:36,317
A person should know her limit, thus, know when not to perform.

284
1173
00:51:36,317 --> 00:51:39,144
I'll apologize on her behalf.

285
1177
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:49,593
Everyone, you've waited a long time for this.

286
1181
00:51:49,593 --> 00:51:56,179
Today, we have a very important announcement that I'd like to officially make.

287
1185
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,500
Important announcement?

288
1189
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:04,848
With us today is my son, Goo JoonPyo's fiancee.

289
1193
00:52:04,848 --> 00:52:09,054
She's the girl who is to be the future wife of ShinHwa Group's head.

290
1197
00:52:09,054 --> 00:52:10,856
What?

291
1201
00:52:10,856 --> 00:52:12,487
Fiancee?

292
1205
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:22,559
Everyone, let me introduce her. She is the daughter of the worldwide JK Group,

293
1209
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,884
Ha JaeKyung.

294
1213
00:52:24,884 --> 00:52:29,299
Hey, let me go! Don't you know I hate this kind of thing?!

295
1217
00:52:29,299 --> 00:52:33,407
Engagement?! What do you mean engagement? 
Let go!

296
1222
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,111
I'll go on my own. Let go! 
 Hey!

297
1227
00:52:39,095 --> 00:52:41,549
High heel?

298
1231
00:52:46,852 --> 00:52:47,789
You!

299
1235
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,959
Engagement?

300
1239
00:52:51,959 --> 00:52:56,161
JK Group. This is definitely JoonPyo's mom's doing.

301
1243
00:52:56,161 --> 00:52:58,433
She's that powerful?

302
1247
00:52:58,433 --> 00:53:02,178
Not really in Korea, but in America she's in every business.

303
1251
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:07,808
From investments to resorts. There's nothing she doesn't own. It's a global company.

304
1255
00:53:07,808 --> 00:53:12,013
We should have investigated more when we were in Macau.

305
1259
00:53:12,013 --> 00:53:16,502
I thought you guys were thoughtless kids, but I see you've grown.

306
1263
00:53:19,256 --> 00:53:26,189
Do you understand now?  That is the standard for the future wife to ShinHwa Group's head.
 I would never accept any less.

307
1268
00:53:31,873 --> 00:53:33,842
What the hell is this?

308
1272
00:53:33,842 --> 00:53:35,465
What's with this sudden engagement thing.

309
1276
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,695
Why the hell did you come here?

310
1280
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:42,807
Do you think I came because I wanted to?

311
1284
00:53:42,807 --> 00:53:44,882
I invited her.

312
1288
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:47,221
What?

313
1292
00:53:47,221 --> 00:53:53,024
Today's event was to introduce your future wife. A friend should at least congratulate you, right?

314
1296
00:53:54,323 --> 00:53:55,054
Are you stupid?

315
1300
00:53:56,227 --> 00:53:58,780
How could you come just because you're invited?

316
1304
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,232
JoonPyo, let's not do that here.

317
1308
00:54:01,232 --> 00:54:02,578
Go somewhere and have a talk between the two of you.

318
1312
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:06,371
I have nothing more to say to Goo JoonPyo.

319
1316
00:54:07,339 --> 00:54:11,485
Now you're starting to understand.

320
1320
00:54:11,485 --> 00:54:16,265
What could you say to someone who has a fiance, hmm?

321
1324
00:54:16,265 --> 00:54:18,782
Excuse me, about the engagement . . . .

322
1328
00:54:20,201 --> 00:54:24,742
All of that seemed like it was some kind of show.  Is this for real?

323
1332
00:54:25,623 --> 00:54:32,382
I'm sorry if I surprised you, but your parents and I already discussed the matter.

324
1336
00:54:32,382 --> 00:54:35,091
This really is the first time I'm hearing about this.

325
1340
00:54:35,091 --> 00:54:37,551
Hey "shoe", just keep quiet.

326
1344
00:54:39,003 --> 00:54:42,161
And you, you have nothing to say to me?

327
1348
00:54:42,907 --> 00:54:45,688
But I do, so don't make a fuss and follow me.

328
1352
00:54:49,013 --> 00:54:54,543
Don't you know by now that  if that  Evil Witch invites you, somewhere that it's a trap?

329
1356
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:57,421
Hey . . . wait.

330
1360
00:54:57,421 --> 00:55:02,058
You're a year older now but your brain is stunted.

331
1364
00:55:02,058 --> 00:55:05,641
It wasn't I but the old witch who called you.  What were you thinking in coming?

332
1368
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:06,591
Hey, wait.

333
1372
00:55:06,591 --> 00:55:10,601
See! She was trying to trick us today.

334
1376
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:15,076
How is it that you so easily fall into every trap?

335
1380
00:55:16,007 --> 00:55:17,945
Hey, Curly Head!

336
1384
00:55:17,945 --> 00:55:19,044
What? Curly head?

337
1388
00:55:19,044 --> 00:55:20,666
Now you're saying whatever you want?

338
1392
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:56,529
Do you now understand that you shouldn't have any more expectations?

339
1396
00:55:56,529 --> 00:56:01,909
Your presence did pay off.  What a relief.

340
1400
00:56:06,184 --> 00:56:10,394
JanDi, what's wrong with her?

341
1404
00:56:10,394 --> 00:56:12,880
JoonPyo really plans to marry that girl?

342
1408
00:56:16,334 --> 00:56:19,437
GaEul, I'll take you back home. 
 JiHoo.

343
1413
00:56:22,206 --> 00:56:25,977
Let's meet at the ----. I'll investigate until then.

344
1417
00:56:44,094 --> 00:56:45,430
Why are you here?

345
1421
00:56:47,031 --> 00:56:51,102
You dragged me here. 
That's why I'm asking. Why were you dragged here?

346
1426
00:56:52,403 --> 00:56:55,740
Ever since Macau, I thought you were weird,

347
1430
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,229
But now I know you really are a crazy fool.

348
1434
00:56:57,229 --> 00:57:01,646
What? Fool? 
If you have eyes, use them.

349
1439
00:57:01,646 --> 00:57:06,484
It's the middle of winter, my legs and back are bare, and you drag me out here.

350
1443
00:57:06,484 --> 00:57:08,369
Shouldn't you apologize?

351
1447
00:57:08,369 --> 00:57:10,405
Who told you to follow me?

352
1451
00:57:10,405 --> 00:57:12,790
Follow?!   Who's following?!

353
1455
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,970
Then fine. From now on, go your own way.

354
1459
00:57:18,029 --> 00:57:19,731
If you follow me again, you're dead.

355
1463
00:57:22,149 --> 00:57:25,136
You, really!   Hey!

356
1467
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:30,803
What are you doing? Hey!

357
1471
00:57:30,803 --> 00:57:34,079
Hurry and apologize! Now! 
Get off me!

358
1476
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,513
Apologize! Hurry!

359
1480
00:57:35,513 --> 00:57:39,659
Aren't you going to apologize? 
You crazy monkey-like thing, get off!

360
1485
00:57:46,092 --> 00:57:47,966
What did you just do?

361
1489
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:51,462
Why is your face so red?

362
1493
00:57:52,363 --> 00:57:55,901
- What ? is it that you ... ?

363
1497
00:57:55,901 --> 00:57:57,701
S..shut up and leave!

364
1501
00:57:57,701 --> 00:58:00,818
I told you to leave. Why do you keep bothering me?

365
1505
00:58:02,573 --> 00:58:03,974
What?

366
1509
00:58:03,974 --> 00:58:06,644
- Give me some money. 
 - What money?

367
1514
00:58:06,644 --> 00:58:10,915
I have to take a taxi back. Don't you see that you dragged me out here with nothing.

368
1518
00:58:10,915 --> 00:58:12,482
I don't have any either.

369
1522
00:58:16,821 --> 00:58:19,557
I said I don't have any money. 
Your cell phone!

370
1527
00:58:19,557 --> 00:58:21,392
Cell phone?

371
1531
00:58:24,062 --> 00:58:28,866
Hey, what are you doing? Where are you touching?

372
1535
00:58:45,383 --> 00:58:50,059
Let go! Do you know who I am?

373
1539
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,856
Miss, are you okay?

374
1543
00:58:59,093 --> 00:59:00,365
Ah!  I said let go!

375
1547
00:59:23,387 --> 00:59:24,722
Are you that shocked?

376
1551
00:59:26,257 --> 00:59:27,092
Excuse me?

377
1555
00:59:28,626 --> 00:59:31,058
JoonPyo's engagement.

378
1559
00:59:31,058 --> 00:59:37,702
No. Whether JoonPyo gets engaged or not, is not my concern anymore.

379
1563
00:59:39,971 --> 00:59:42,073
You should know that already.

380
1567
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:45,209
JoonPyo probably didn't know about it either.

381
1571
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:49,213
About the engagement.

382
1575
00:59:49,213 --> 00:59:53,245
If it was real, he would've told us already.

383
1579
00:59:54,385 --> 01:00:01,191
No, that person . . .

384
1583
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:03,761
probably knows Goo JoonPyo.

385
1587
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:07,437
How do you know?

386
1591
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,701
I saw her in Macau.

387
1595
01:00:26,182 --> 01:00:27,886
I'll get going.

388
1599
01:00:29,587 --> 01:00:30,806
Geum JanDi . . .

389
1603
01:00:32,657 --> 01:00:36,027
- What I told JoonPyo in Macau . . . 
- I know.

390
1608
01:00:37,261 --> 01:00:41,465
You were just mad at JoonPyo and rashly said it.

391
1612
01:00:54,811 --> 01:00:56,013
You're right.

392
1616
01:00:56,681 --> 01:01:01,285
I won't let it bother me. Don't worry about it.

393
1620
01:01:01,285 --> 01:01:02,587
Geum JanDi,

394
1624
01:01:04,422 --> 01:01:09,060
Things you can see with your eyes are not always real.

395
1628
01:01:10,695 --> 01:01:15,378
Some things . . .

396
1632
01:01:17,502 --> 01:01:19,337
You need faith to see them.

397
1636
01:01:26,076 --> 01:01:33,047
I'll just go. I can go alone.

398
1640
01:01:33,047 --> 01:01:36,587
Good night. / Good bye.

399
1644
01:02:15,425 --> 01:02:20,264
Yoon JiHoo, what are you doing?
