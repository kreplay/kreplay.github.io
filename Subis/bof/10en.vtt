1
3
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:05,613
It's the first time I've seen you here.

2
7
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:08,082
I am...

3
11
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:11,085
You!

4
15
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,187
Ga Eul!

5
19
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:16,056
You came to see me!

6
23
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:18,693
You should have dressed like this before.

7
27
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:20,928
I didn't recognize you.

8
31
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:25,700
Shall we go out?

9
35
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:28,937
Miss Ga Eul.

10
39
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:32,140
Do you know this person?

11
43
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:42,317
No, I don't know this person.

12
47
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:44,318
Ga Eul!

13
51
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,721
What is your relationship with this bastard?

14
55
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:54,729
She's the one who has stolen my heart and has yet to give it back.

15
59
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:05,073
Miss Ga Eul, stop worrying and come to me now.

16
63
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:17,852
Ga Eul . . .

17
67
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:36,027
Gee! So lucky. How many good deeds did she do in her previous life?

18
71
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,684
Although we're just acting, wouldn't it be better to act perfectly till the end?

19
75
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:37,432
Yes, yes. Thank you!

20
79
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:40,168
Master, pumpkin porridge.

21
83
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:43,971
What are all these?

22
87
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,940
It's Valentine's day tomorrow.

23
91
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,210
It would be sad if it just passed by

24
95
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:52,580
- For whom?
- Me? Me?

25
100
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,815
Just . . .

26
104
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:57,251
Someone I'm thankful for.

27
108
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:00,822
But Jan Di, aren't you going to give chocolates to Joon Pyo Sunbae?

28
112
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:04,492
You should take these too.

29
116
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:07,793
Why should I give them to him?

30
120
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:11,266
Just this one...
Hey that's...

31
125
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,928
N .. N .. Not this one!!

32
129
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:16,403
Aw give it to me.
Not this one!

33
134
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:20,674
The state of this restaurant, it's absolutely terrible

34
138
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:23,877
The philosophy of food, the chef's abyss,

35
142
00:05:23,877 --> 00:05:29,350
I guess this horrible place is a place where things like that don't exist!

36
146
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:32,654
Grandpa, our porridge is good.

37
150
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:34,289
Ja Jang Myun!
(noodles with stir-fried bean paste)

38
155
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:38,426
Grandpa, this is a porridge shop.

39
159
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:42,096
If you want Ja Jang Myun, you should go to a Chinese restaurant.

40
163
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:43,931
Ja Jang Myun!

41
167
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:45,667
Wait, Grandpa!

42
171
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:50,171
Grandpa, they are selling Ja Jang Myun over there in Sang Hae Ru.

43
175
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,973
Please go there.

44
179
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:54,108
Please hold on.

45
183
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:57,011
Huh?
- Ja Jang Myun is okay.

46
188
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:15,964
How was it?

47
192
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:19,901
That was the worst Ja Jang Myun I'd ever eaten.

48
196
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:25,873
How can you sell food with this nonexistent ability to cook, this terrible place...

49
200
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:29,077
Who said you could order a Ja Jang Myun in a porridge shop?

50
204
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:34,048
Grandpa, even if it was, you should pay for the Ja Jang Myun.

51
208
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,417
How much do we have to charge?

52
212
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,574
$3.50?

53
216
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:42,156
Since it's a special at our porridge shop, 5000 won.

54
220
00:06:43,657 --> 00:06:44,992
What is this?

55
224
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:46,561
For the Ja Jang Myun.

56
228
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:49,530
Grandpa, we only accept money, how can we accept this?

57
232
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,701
I'm not giving you money after eating crap like that! 
Take it!

58
237
00:06:56,871 --> 00:07:01,309
Tell the cook or whatever, the next is a Mae Gi Mae Un Tang.
(Mae Gi Mae Un Tang = hot pepper catfish stew)

59
242
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:02,677
Huh?
- You'll be coming back?

60
247
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:08,916
You worthless people, and this crappy restaurant...

61
251
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:12,286
Goodbye.

62
255
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:13,388
Master!

63
259
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:19,493
How could anyone be like that grandpa?

64
263
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:25,199
Master, don't let it bother you. It seemed like he was suffering from Alzheimer's.

65
267
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:31,272
But, can we try some?

66
271
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,658
Delicious!

67
275
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:52,360
It's much better than Sang Hae Ru's.

68
279
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:08,276
Are you really going to make spicy catfish stew for him?

69
283
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:10,077
Master!

70
287
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:24,425
It's Valentine's Day tomorrow.

71
291
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:27,728
It would be sad if it just passed by.

72
295
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:29,530
Who are you going to give it to?

73
299
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,900
Just, someone I'm thankful for.

74
303
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,475
But, Jan Di, aren't you going to give chocolates to Joon Pyo Sunbae?

75
307
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:17,111
Chocolates?

76
311
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:20,047
Chocolate? Yeah right.

77
315
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:33,554
Why did you want to meet in a place like this?

78
319
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:35,957
Anyway, you have no sense of choosing a place.

79
323
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:41,829
I came here with something good planned for a change. .
Why don't you just follow my lead?

80
328
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:44,065
Ah, it's cold. Let's go in somewhere else first.

81
332
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:46,533
Follow me.
Where?

82
337
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:49,136
Your're going to take me somewhere weird again 
and cause trouble, aren't you?

83
342
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:02,851
Hey!
Where are you going?

84
347
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:17,581
It's fun and warm, and there's tea for free here.

85
351
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:20,685
It wasn't made for insincere users like you.

86
355
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:28,451
Ah, it seems the owner lacks customer service, I can't help it but to worry for the future of your group.

87
359
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:34,538
By the way, what is that?

88
363
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:43,916
This? It's nothing.
Give it to me.

89
368
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:56,754
-This...
-I made them to give to someone else...
 but I ruined them...

90
374
00:11:58,256 --> 00:12:03,612
They look terrible don't they?

91
378
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:07,198
I'm going to eat one.

92
382
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:12,520
Hey! You gave it to me, then it's all mine.
Urgh.

93
387
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:30,755
Yes everyone's been waiting a long time, this  Valentine's Day event is for a free cell phone and will start right now! 
All those who want to join the couple hanging on event, please come down right now!

94
392
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:40,445
Everyone waited and then started rushing down right now.

95
396
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:43,601
I will give you mobile phones for free.

96
400
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:50,207
Ah, the last one team, the last team!
Oh, they are in.

97
405
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:57,163
The economy must be really hard; everyone rushed out as soon as I said "start."

98
409
00:12:57,163 --> 00:12:59,984
No.1, shout "fighting", please. No.1!
Fighting.

99
414
00:12:59,984 --> 00:13:00,718
No.2!
Fighting.

100
419
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:02,388
No.3!
Fighting.
No.4!
Fighting.

101
426
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:02,936
No.5!
Fighting.

102
431
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:03,754
No.6!
Fighting.

103
436
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:04,556
No.7!
Fighting.

104
441
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:04,956
No.8!
Fighting.

105
446
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:05,856
No.9!
Fighting.

106
451
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:12,896
The rule is simple. First, take out your bags, please.
Regardless of gender,.

107
456
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:23,641
One should be hanging on the other.
No.4 is already ready.

108
461
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:26,777
I will count to three.
One, two, three!

109
466
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:38,655
Keep hanging.
Man, you need to bend down more. You're too stiff, even though you have a lot of waves in your hair.
Softly! Ok, you keep hanging that way.

110
472
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:44,128
Yes, there we've got it.

111
476
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:55,906
Geeze! Is it time for bed already? 
No.1 is out! You only held on for 2 seconds, yet your faces are all red.
With one couple already out the real competition will start to heat up.

112
482
00:13:55,906 --> 00:14:12,723
Oh that's good, very good, great!

113
486
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:21,332
It has finally been 57 minutes.
The last two teams! Who will be the winner?
For how long do you think you will stay?

114
492
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:33,678
I will do my best and stay till the very end.
For the man, for how long do you think you will?
Until we win.
What?  Until you wink?  Again, please.  How long?
- Until we win..

115
500
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:40,117
He's reliable.
His girlfriend needs to say a message of support..

116
505
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:48,726
Oh yes, no need for messages, 
you're happy with just being held.

117
510
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:58,535
Hey, laundry! This is really embarrassing . . . 
If they knew the chairman's son was doing this thing, it would make the front page of the newspaper.

118
515
00:14:58,535 --> 00:15:04,308
Hey, be quiet. This isn't very pleasant
 for me either. I'm exhausted.
If you need a mobile phone that badly,
 you could just ask me. I'll buy one for you.

119
522
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:07,745
The point is to earn it on my own.

120
526
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:10,714
On your own? I'm the one doing all the work.

121
530
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:47,084
For the last time, "sit down and stand up" once.

122
534
00:15:47,084 --> 00:16:01,164
Sit down,
and stand up.
There are beads of sweat on the men's foreheads.

123
540
00:16:01,164 --> 00:16:11,341
Who will be the last team standing. It's exciting.
Oh she fell! Finally the first place couple has come forth!

124
545
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:17,915
I knew they would win from the moment they first entered!
How do you feel?

125
550
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:34,499
- I'm so happy! 
- Yes congratulations! 
Everyone why don't you give them a hand.  Congratulations.

126
556
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:36,901
Let go! Let me go!

127
560
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,294
I'll go on my own.

128
564
00:17:58,138 --> 00:18:05,016
Ga Eul, what brings you here?
The thing is, I was just . . ..

129
569
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:09,593
Jung, she must have come to give you chocolates.

130
573
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:17,634
Today is Valentine's Day?
Miss, your nose looks red, you must have waited a long time.

131
578
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:24,875
Ga Eul, why don't you at least have a cup of tea.
No, it's fine.
Don't be like that, come in..

132
584
00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:39,657
I'll bring the tea.

133
588
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:55,824
Leave yours there too.

134
592
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:04,348
Excuse me. I'll be going first.

135
596
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:23,200
Let me go please.

136
600
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:28,671
This is why nice girls are so annoying.

137
604
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:35,212
Ga Eul, listen carefully.
 What happened yesterday, all of that was just acting.
You shouldn't misunderstand.

138
610
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:50,427
I'll keep this until you meet the person of your destiny.
Thanks.

139
615
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:48,020
Did anyone call a chauffeur service?

140
619
00:21:15,443 --> 00:21:17,448
How did you know?

141
623
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,885
I told you, I was called as a pick up service.

142
627
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:23,853
Huh?

143
631
00:21:23,853 --> 00:21:27,324
Joon Pyo called as he was being dragged away.

144
635
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:42,306
Thank you.

145
639
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:46,173
Well . . .

146
643
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,610
Geum Jan Di

147
647
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:54,348
If anything happens, you can tell me you know?

148
651
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,884
Does anything have to happen?

149
655
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:00,621
I hope not.

150
659
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:06,927
*sigh* I doubt anything will happen.

151
663
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:11,732
Honestly, it's not like Joon Pyo and I are in a serious relationship.

152
667
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,002
Please drive carefully.

153
671
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:19,005
Geum Jan Di.

154
675
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,742
I told you not to worry.

155
679
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:25,279
Are you going to go in wearing that?

156
683
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:28,248
Huh?

157
687
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:37,457
Ah, I was just about to give it to you.

158
691
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,833
Goodbye.

159
695
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:27,808
Her father is a dry cleaner and her mother works as a cashier at a public bathhouse.

160
699
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,042
Yes, that's right.

161
703
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:34,647
How did someone like her get into Shin Hwa School?

162
707
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:39,318
You're not making any sense!  Who is her supporter?

163
711
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,122
You ordered it, ma'am.

164
715
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:42,856
What?

165
719
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:48,095
Do you know why public opinion is something to be wary of? Because it is ignorant.

166
723
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:52,498
Once it goes berserk, it becomes unmanageable

167
727
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:55,235
Reason or common sense doesn't work anymore.

168
731
00:23:57,474 --> 00:24:00,307
The one who set the fire should extinguish it.

169
735
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,785
Why didn't you deal with it before?

170
739
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:15,923
I thought he was tormenting the young lady as he had done before.

171
743
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:18,625
Young lady?  What young lady?

172
747
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,327
I'm sorry, ma'am.

173
751
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,133
Young master wants to see you . . .

174
755
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,139
That girl, don't mess with her.

175
759
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,074
What?

176
763
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:35,909
I said don't mess with her.

177
767
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:38,211
I don't know what you are talking about now.

178
771
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:43,917
Ah! You're talking about the girl we saw at the event today?

179
775
00:24:54,528 --> 00:25:01,301
That much free time isn't available to waste on such worthless matters like that,

 for the owner of Shin Hwa Group!

180
781
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:03,970
All right then.

181
785
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,617
Prepare it right away.

182
789
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,152
Yes ma'am.

183
793
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,047
Geeze!

184
797
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:11,138
He's like a ghost.

185
801
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,748
You, where did you get that?

186
805
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,617
Well . . .

187
809
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,322
Where could have I gotten it?

188
813
00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:30,690
Hey! Don't eat it!

189
817
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:46,606
Ji Hoo,

190
821
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,744
why am I feeling so uneasy?

191
825
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:58,818
I feel like something is going to happen to her.

192
829
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,459
What I'm most worried about is,

193
833
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:11,498
the moment she is in danger,

194
837
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:15,202
I might not even know.

195
841
00:27:37,547 --> 00:27:39,592
Don't worry.

196
845
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:43,496
Geum Jan Di isn't that weak.

197
849
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,465
You should know that well.

198
853
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,236
Don't be afraid either.

199
857
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:52,672
We will always . . .

200
861
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,343
be there for you.

201
865
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:12,892
The international hotel chain Lavender's  executive director Kang Hee Soo,

202
869
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:16,396
has been elected as the 
International Hotel Association's President.

203
874
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:17,819
Are you satisfied with the results?

204
878
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,902
There is no satisfaction until I become the best.

205
882
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:25,672
Who is that person?

206
886
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:28,141
That person is Joon Pyo hyung-nim's mother?

207
890
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:32,946
Wow, Shin Hwa's people sure are different than others. Look, look at that charisma!

208
894
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:35,514
There's no better female than her!

209
898
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:39,119
There's no satisfaction until I become the best.

210
902
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,553
How about that, did it sound like her?

211
906
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:44,391
She may become our in-law anyway we can't be faded.

212
910
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:47,860
- A little bit similar.
- Similar? 
Did someone come?

213
916
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,603
Joon Pyo hyung-nim?
- Young master Joon Pyo? Son-in-Law Joon Pyo?

214
921
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,731
Goo Seo Bang (Son-in-law)?

215
925
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:56,002
Joon Pyo hyung-nim?

216
929
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,043
I've seen her before somewhere . . .

217
933
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:09,749
From before..the one who came out on TV.

218
937
00:29:11,718 --> 00:29:15,689
Before becoming the best, there is no satisfaction...

219
941
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:18,325
Oh my!
 President!

220
946
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,928
Is someone here?

221
950
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:40,880
You seem very surprised at my sudden appearance.

222
954
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,617
Not at all. Young master Joon Pyo . . .

223
958
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:48,788
No, I mean we've gotten used to it, thanks to your son.

224
962
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:51,658
Joon Pyo has been here before?

225
966
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:55,795
Of course!  Not only did he just come here, he's slept here.

226
970
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,598
made kimchi, went to the bathhouse,

227
974
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,104
I'll just get to the point.

228
978
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:07,807
Oh, of course, you're a very busy person.

229
982
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:13,913
I believe that when a person is born,

230
986
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:17,616
They are born into separate worldswith specific roles they must carry out.

231
990
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:25,525
Joon Pyo is a child that must carry out, not 
just Korea or Asia, but the entire world.

232
995
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:29,129
Of course. The world renowned Shin Hwa Group!

233
999
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,934
And I will do everything in my power

234
1003
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:38,605
as his mother, to make sure he fulfills that role.

235
1007
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:41,408
Of course you need to do that.

236
1011
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,945
And in order to raise Jan Di (grass) well,

237
1015
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:52,985
Yes my role as a mother, I will try my hardest to raise Jan Di as a good match to master Joon Pyo . . .

238
1019
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,454
That's not it.

239
1023
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:59,025
Not that, but the grass from the golfing place.

240
1027
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:02,628
Excuse me?

241
1031
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:05,932
Do you know what is needed to grow good grass?

242
1035
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,335
A fertilizer?

243
1039
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:13,640
It's pulling out the weeds.

244
1043
00:31:16,776 --> 00:31:18,978
The most important thing is pulling out  from the roots

245
1047
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:24,083
those which do more harm than good to the grass, 
and which cannot be left together.

246
1052
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,489
By chance do you mean . . .

247
1056
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:34,894
Are you saying that our  Jan Di is a weed?

248
1060
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:38,331
I'm glad you understand what I'm saying.

249
1064
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:46,239
Typically, they kill the weed with poisonous spray.

250
1068
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,241
but this time . . .

251
1072
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:50,359
Manager Jeong.

252
1076
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,160
Yes.

253
1080
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,172
This is 300 million won. 
 ($300,000)

254
1085
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:13,515
If it isn't enough, we can give you more..

255
1089
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:17,819
Since this is also my mistake for neglecting my son.

256
1093
00:32:18,379 --> 00:32:19,522
Manager Jeong.

257
1097
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:21,123
Yes.

258
1101
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,224
[A written promise]

259
1105
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:35,837
This is a contract that you'll never meet with Joon Pyo again.

260
1109
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:39,107
All you have to do is sign here.

261
1113
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:41,910
Excuse me..

262
1117
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:46,782
Honey!

263
1121
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:49,618
Mom!

264
1125
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,727
Leave now.

265
1129
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:03,899
You're making a big mistake right now.

266
1133
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,036
whether it's a small or big mistake,

267
1137
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:11,006
I'm a better person  than you who calls someone else's child a weed and such right in front of them.

268
1141
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:13,709
Get out now. Didn't you hear me?!

269
1145
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:15,577
Kang San. What are you doing? Call the police.

270
1149
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,312
What are you doing honey?

271
1153
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,914
Hurry up and throw them out!

272
1157
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,049
Okay.

273
1161
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:21,750
Won't you regret it?

274
1165
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:25,388
I'm not a generous woman. There won't be another chance.

275
1169
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:30,625
I don't want to chance running into a woman like you again!

276
1173
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:32,961
Let's go.

277
1177
00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:31,619
Mom.

278
1181
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:32,988
Honey!

279
1185
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,390
Where did you find that courage?

280
1189
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:38,456
Mom, I was impressed, really.

281
1193
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:41,896
I've never been so proud of you.

282
1197
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:46,134
You single handedly showed us that the pride is more important than money.

283
1201
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:49,437
What is he talking about?

284
1205
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:52,907
How can the pride be more important than money?
Money is most important.

285
1210
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:58,847
In the world of capitalism, money is the most important thing in whatever you do. What good is pride?

286
1214
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,950
Honey. 
Then, why did you do that?

287
1219
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,587
That woman brings only 300 million won and expects us to be satisfied with that?

288
1223
00:35:05,587 --> 00:35:07,655
is she making fun of us or something?

289
1227
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:11,092
Every Korean citizen, even 3 year olds know of Shin Hwa Group, and 300 million

290
1231
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:12,627
is all she brings to offer us?

291
1235
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:13,929
Then?

292
1239
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:17,532
Forget that.  Just marry Joon Pyo.

293
1243
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:21,002
And eve though she's alive right now, she's not going to live forever.

294
1247
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:25,841
When she dies all the Shin Hwa fortune will be passed down to Joon Pyo. And all of it will belong to you too.

295
1251
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:28,009
What the hell is 300 million dollars?

296
1255
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:29,377
Mom.

297
1259
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,712
What?

298
1263
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,548
You should be bold.

299
1267
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:38,053
Our goal is that Shin Hwa distribution, Shin Hwa aviation, Shin Hwa electronics and Shin Hwa...

300
1271
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:41,156
cement and car industry and . . . 
What was that?

301
1276
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:43,125
And what was that other thing? 
Lavender.

302
1281
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,694
The hotel too, will all be yours.

303
1285
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:47,162
MOM!

304
1289
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:51,999
What?  Who knows if you're going to be on the news 20 years later?

305
1293
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:56,505
There is no satisfaction before you become the best.

306
1297
00:35:56,505 --> 00:36:00,542
Right, right, that.
You sure are my Mom.

307
1302
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:07,015
Honey, I never knew that you had such a deeper meaning behind this.

308
1306
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:11,219
As long as you know now, it's ok.

309
1310
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:31,039
Do you know what you need to make the grass grow well?

310
1314
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,543
Pull the weeds.

311
1318
00:36:33,543 --> 00:36:40,949
Pulling the roots of the weed that cannot be with the grass is the most important thing.

312
1322
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:23,018
Do you have a concert ticket?

313
1326
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:26,955
Why are you here so late?

314
1330
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:30,358
Then what about you? What are you doing here so late?

315
1334
00:38:31,927 --> 00:38:36,565
I don't think I heard that swimming was included in the winter Olympics.

316
1338
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:41,436
I . . . just . . .

317
1342
00:38:41,436 --> 00:38:43,471
Feeling frustrated?

318
1346
00:38:44,735 --> 00:38:48,876
Since you don't have a ticket, why don't you come up here and flip the pages?

319
1350
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:19,934
I won't take it today.

320
1354
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:27,175
Why are you looking at me like that?

321
1358
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,510
Just because . . .

322
1362
00:40:30,478 --> 00:40:31,713
it's so interesting.

323
1366
00:40:31,713 --> 00:40:33,314
What is?

324
1370
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:37,985
It's that when I ring the emergency bell in my heart,

325
1374
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:40,221
you always show up.

326
1378
00:40:40,322 --> 00:40:42,557
Emergency bell?

327
1382
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:46,461
Like the one you ring when there's a fire.

328
1386
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:47,529
Yeah.

329
1390
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,931
Then that's what I'll be.

330
1394
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:51,866
What?

331
1398
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,002
Geum Jan Di's honorable firefighter.

332
1402
00:40:57,972 --> 00:41:01,909
Thank you so much for today.  Go home safely.

333
1406
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,625
Yes, Mom.

334
1410
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,794
What's wrong?

335
1414
00:41:21,863 --> 00:41:25,399
Stop crying and speak clearly so I can understand.

336
1418
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,836
What?

337
1422
00:41:31,938 --> 00:41:34,476
Why are they suddenly telling us to get rid of the dry cleaners?

338
1426
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:41,449
Well, they said that the landlord's son will get a job with the Shin Hwa company if they do!

339
1430
00:41:43,284 --> 00:41:51,526
The real estate agent Mr. Yoo said there's probably no one in this neighborhood that'll rent us anything.

340
1434
00:41:51,526 --> 00:41:53,450
If it's not to her liking...

341
1438
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:56,987
She should have come here  herself and told us

342
1442
00:41:56,987 --> 00:42:02,626
How can she be so cheap and go behind our backs when our lives are on the line

343
1446
00:42:04,495 --> 00:42:07,131
She actually did come around and tell us.

344
1450
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:10,701
But you poured salt on her and kicked her out, Mom.

345
1454
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:13,937
So what? Then what do u want me to do?

346
1458
00:42:14,736 --> 00:42:18,742
What is my family gonna eat and live off of?

347
1462
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,621
What is this?

348
1466
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:36,793
Today is our first day, so our life depends on how well we do, ok?

349
1470
00:42:36,793 --> 00:42:37,761
How are you going to sell them?  Start!

350
1474
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:40,698
We sell hot coffees! Coffee!

351
1478
00:42:40,698 --> 00:42:44,601
How about you?
Squids... squids... 
 Shout out loud!

352
1484
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:47,705
Shout out more casually.

353
1488
00:42:47,705 --> 00:42:50,574
Here we have squids!

354
1492
00:42:50,574 --> 00:42:53,076
Smile. SMILE!

355
1496
00:42:53,076 --> 00:42:57,413
Yes, yes!  Squids!

356
1500
00:42:57,413 --> 00:43:00,617
We have pop rices!  Pop!

357
1504
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:03,154
Pop! 
 We have pop rices!

358
1509
00:43:03,154 --> 00:43:04,013
Knock the drivers window and . . .

359
1513
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:06,044
Don't we have to tell them how much it is? 
Knock on the drivers window and . . .

360
1518
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:07,393
We can just tell when people ask!

361
1522
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:09,963
Come gather. Let's shout fighting and disperse.

362
1526
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:13,530
Aja!  Aja!   Fighting!

363
1530
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,142
Disperse!

364
1534
00:43:14,142 --> 00:43:19,803
Pop rice!  Squid!  It's only 3000 won!

365
1538
00:43:19,803 --> 00:43:24,508
It only costs 3000 won!

366
1542
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:42,485
Pop . . .
We have pop rice . . .

367
1547
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:45,629
Pop . . .

368
1551
00:43:45,629 --> 00:43:49,533
What are you doing mom?  Here's pop rice!

369
1555
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:53,136
Pop . . . Pop rice . . .

370
1559
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:55,605
Mom, I can't hear a thing!

371
1563
00:43:55,605 --> 00:43:57,340
Give it to me!

372
1567
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,477
We have pop rice! Pop. pop, pop!

373
1571
00:44:00,477 --> 00:44:01,011
You try.

374
1575
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:04,581
We have pop rice. Pop pop pop!

375
1579
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,023
Pop . . .

376
1583
00:44:17,294 --> 00:44:20,097
Ahjumma, can I have one pop rice?

377
1587
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:23,967
Why aren't you giving me the pop rice?

378
1591
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:27,771
Mom!  The pop rice.
Ah, that will be 2000 won!

379
1596
00:44:27,771 --> 00:44:29,673
Thank you!

380
1600
00:44:50,293 --> 00:44:52,496
Why do I have to go there?

381
1604
00:44:52,496 --> 00:44:56,866
Why don't you just go by yourself like you usually do?  You shouldn't do things just to annoy people . . .

382
1608
00:44:56,866 --> 00:45:00,270
Because you're Shin Hwa Group's successor, not me.

383
1612
00:45:01,606 --> 00:45:04,074
Why is there so much traffic?

384
1616
00:45:04,074 --> 00:45:06,443
Do we have to go this way?

385
1620
00:45:06,443 --> 00:45:10,570
Mr. Jung, why don't we buy some of that?

386
1624
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:15,952
Over there . . . what's the name of the circle thing on the street?

387
1628
00:45:16,854 --> 00:45:19,256
Do you mean pop rice?

388
1632
00:45:20,297 --> 00:45:22,525
Yes that.

389
1636
00:45:22,525 --> 00:45:24,161
Are you crazy?

390
1640
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:27,431
The great chairman Mrs. Kang is buying pop rice on the street?

391
1644
00:45:29,098 --> 00:45:30,867
Are you sick or something?

392
1648
00:45:32,156 --> 00:45:33,379
Mr. Jung.

393
1652
00:45:33,845 --> 00:45:34,904
Yes, Madam.

394
1656
00:45:40,377 --> 00:45:42,579
Okay!

395
1660
00:45:43,847 --> 00:45:45,549
It's 2000 won.

396
1664
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:02,967
Thanks a lot!

397
1668
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:32,362
The smell, the dust . . .  
I cannot understand how they can sell those things with exhaust gas all around, how stupid.

398
1673
00:46:32,362 --> 00:46:33,964
Put it away.

399
1677
00:46:33,964 --> 00:46:35,899
Yes, Ma'am.

400
1681
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,499
Can we have a can of coffee please!

401
1685
00:46:48,744 --> 00:46:49,880
Hey miss!

402
1689
00:46:51,415 --> 00:46:57,120
What are you doing!? Here's coffee!

403
1693
00:47:02,693 --> 00:47:05,762
Pop rice!

404
1697
00:47:06,863 --> 00:47:08,832
2000 won...

405
1701
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:20,878
Stop the car.

406
1705
00:47:20,878 --> 00:47:21,745
Just drive.

407
1709
00:47:21,745 --> 00:47:22,546
Stop the car!

408
1713
00:47:22,546 --> 00:47:23,914
There is no need to stop the car.

409
1717
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:25,949
Stop the car, can't you hear me!?

410
1721
00:47:42,198 --> 00:47:43,333
Goo Joon Pyo!

411
1725
00:48:14,497 --> 00:48:17,100
Thank God!

412
1729
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:48,931
you'd just say,"How much do you need?" and try to pay for everything.

413
1733
00:48:48,931 --> 00:48:51,301
If the landlord wants to shut down the laundry, you can just set up somewhere else.

414
1737
00:48:51,301 --> 00:48:53,503
Why embarras . . .

415
1741
00:48:58,342 --> 00:49:04,581
Yeah... I know my family probably is embarrassing,

416
1745
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:09,119
But I'm not sorry for any of it.

417
1749
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,657
-What I meant was. . . 
- Us dating and my family circumstances
 are two different things.

418
1755
00:49:15,892 --> 00:49:21,498
Plus, just because you're my boyfriend doesn't mean you can jump in and do everything for me.

419
1759
00:49:21,498 --> 00:49:22,999
Then what am I supposed to do?

420
1763
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:27,237
Do I just sit back and watch as your family sells pop rice in the street?

421
1767
00:49:27,237 --> 00:49:31,841
Yes. That's exactly what you should do.

422
1771
00:49:31,841 --> 00:49:33,576
What?

423
1775
00:49:34,411 --> 00:49:37,280
Don't do anything and just watch.

424
1779
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,216
If you want to continue being my boyfriend.

425
1783
00:49:40,216 --> 00:49:42,018
Hey, dry cleaner.

426
1787
00:49:43,486 --> 00:49:46,623
You haven't called me that in a while.

427
1791
00:49:50,126 --> 00:49:52,462
But what to do?

428
1795
00:49:52,462 --> 00:49:55,832
I'm no longer the daugher of a dry cleaner.

429
1799
00:49:59,468 --> 00:50:01,504
Geum Jan Di,

430
1803
00:50:02,372 --> 00:50:04,674
I'm not trying to scare you and

431
1807
00:50:04,674 --> 00:50:09,813
There's no need to be afraid. Just know this.

432
1811
00:50:11,582 --> 00:50:16,986
We never know what my mom is going to do next. That's just her character.

433
1815
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:21,624
I thought so.

434
1819
00:50:26,594 --> 00:50:28,898
Promise me.

435
1823
00:50:28,898 --> 00:50:30,266
What?

436
1827
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:34,637
That if anything happens, you'll tell me immediately.

437
1831
00:50:48,617 --> 00:50:51,154
I can't promise you that.

438
1835
00:50:51,154 --> 00:50:52,522
What?

439
1839
00:51:15,978 --> 00:51:19,148
I'm glad you are Geum Jan Di.

440
1843
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,550
What?

441
1847
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:28,157
I'm glad that Geum Jan Di, the commoner, the gangster, is my girlfriend. I am extremely fortunate.

442
1851
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:34,130
That promise makes me feel relieved.

443
1855
00:52:49,919 --> 00:52:56,292
Yes, hello?  It says that you're looking to hire night shift part time workers.

444
1859
00:52:56,292 --> 00:53:01,731
Oh, okay.  I understand.

445
1863
00:53:15,177 --> 00:53:19,897
Here's the Pumpkin porridge.  
 Okay.

446
1868
00:53:22,711 --> 00:53:32,030
The pumpkin porridge you ordered is out.  Please enjoy it. 
 Also, it's really hot, so make sure you cool it a bit first before you eat.

447
1873
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:37,566
You're really on top of things.  
 Our porridge is really good so please come often.

448
1878
00:53:37,566 --> 00:53:44,907
But, your face (mask) is really cute.  College student?  
 No, I'm a high school student.

449
1883
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:48,744
Oh, then that might be a bit difficult.  
  What is?

450
1888
00:53:48,744 --> 00:53:58,754
Our company uses a lot of student models, and I really like your image.
 I see.

451
1893
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:09,203
But, how much does it pay?

452
1897
00:54:09,661 --> 00:54:11,201
Look at this.

453
1901
00:54:29,018 --> 00:54:39,028
Whoa.  What can I get for you?  Canned coffee or crackers?  
  No, honey, you can tell by just looking at them that they came for the dried squid.  How many should I get you?

454
1906
00:54:39,028 --> 00:54:41,998
Who said you guys can sell things here without permission?

455
1910
00:54:42,966 --> 00:54:46,135
Guys!  Trash the place!

456
1914
00:54:55,612 --> 00:54:58,300
You must pay tax.

457
1918
00:54:58,832 --> 00:55:00,886
What the hell is this!?

458
1922
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:04,282
Who gave you permission? You have to pay tax to be here.

459
1926
00:55:04,282 --> 00:55:07,023
Please stop mister!

460
1930
00:55:10,165 --> 00:55:13,277
Do you really think that she(JP's mom) would go that far?

461
1934
00:55:13,277 --> 00:55:15,329
It still bothers me.

462
1938
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:17,833
Then, you should check it out.

463
1942
00:55:18,306 --> 00:55:21,036
Give me your phone.  
  My phone?

464
1947
00:55:21,036 --> 00:55:23,539
Why?  Is your phone battery dead?

465
1951
00:55:35,517 --> 00:55:36,986
Hello?

466
1955
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,689
Hello?

467
1959
00:55:40,689 --> 00:55:42,792
Yi Jung Sunbae?

468
1963
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:50,066
Yi Jung Sunbae?  Hello?  
  Oh, Miss Ga Eul.  Hi?

469
1968
00:56:01,678 --> 00:56:06,483
Hello.  How much should I put in? 
 Fill it up.

470
1973
00:56:06,483 --> 00:56:10,052
What payment method should I help you with?

471
1977
00:56:14,056 --> 00:56:15,458
Sunbae!

472
1981
00:56:22,362 --> 00:56:27,369
Actually, I thought I was going to pass out because I was so tired. Thank you, Sunbae.

473
1985
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:30,172
Aren't you overdoing it?

474
1989
00:56:30,866 --> 00:56:37,479
Don't you know who I am?  It's me!  The commoner representative of the Republic Of Korea, Geum JanDi!

475
1993
00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:40,385
I'm nothing if you take away my stamina and willpower.

476
1997
00:56:40,385 --> 00:56:42,085
Liar.

477
2001
00:56:55,565 --> 00:56:59,635
Wait, I have a lot of tissues......

478
2005
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:08,811
It's heartbreaking.

479
2009
00:57:24,894 --> 00:57:27,831
Please don't tell Goo Joon Pyo.

480
2013
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:39,575
I want to take care of my own life. That's the only way I can keep my pride.

481
2017
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:44,013
I'm so jealous of Joon Pyo.

482
2021
00:57:47,517 --> 00:57:49,318
I'm going.

483
2025
00:58:17,012 --> 00:58:20,119
Hey, Geum Kang San, you don't have lunch money so you're skipping meals, huh?
You have to watch everyone eating. What are you going to do about all that hunger?

484
2030
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:23,419
They say "Even Mt. Geum-Gang is happy after eating." (Everything goes better on a full stomach.)
 What to do? poor boy!

485
2035
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:25,855
Who are they?

486
2039
00:58:25,855 --> 00:58:27,090
Let's go.

487
2043
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,329
Wait, wait, wait!  Kang San, are you going around starving?

488
2047
00:58:30,329 --> 00:58:32,761
No.

489
2051
00:58:32,761 --> 00:58:39,402
No, wait. Hurry, and tell me the truth, or I'm going to hunt you down at school.

490
2055
00:58:39,402 --> 00:58:42,708
Well, I just told the school that I don't want to eat because I don't want to pay.

491
2059
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:46,442
My teacher wanted to pay it for me, but I didn't want that.

492
2063
00:58:47,844 --> 00:58:49,759
Why are you telling me this now?!

493
2067
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:57,889
Your job in the morning, the porridge shop, then the gas station at night.  How could I tell you?
  I'm not going to die from not eating one meal. Right?

494
2072
00:58:57,889 --> 00:59:02,658
I'm going, bye!
Hey, hey! You . . . 


495
2078
00:59:05,228 --> 00:59:11,433
But he's still so small... it's heartbreaking...

496
2082
00:59:47,602 --> 00:59:49,905
Excuse me, sorry!

497
2086
00:59:52,108 --> 00:59:53,609
Thank you.

498
2090
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,234
'E.J.(EnJoY) Production'

499
2094
01:00:36,819 --> 01:00:38,287
Excuse me.

500
2098
01:00:46,529 --> 01:00:49,031
Anybody?
