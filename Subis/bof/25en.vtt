00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:38,807
Abracadabra...Goo Joon Pyo, remember Geum Jan Di, remember Geum Jan Di...

3
11
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:44,482
Abracadabra, abracadabra..!!

4
15
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:47,541
Ohhh!! You scared mee!

5
19
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,396
You little brat!! What the hell are you doing here??

6
23
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:53,597
I think that you've been under a lot of stress lately.

7
27
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:55,796
You're getting a zit on that good-looking face of yours.

8
31
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,614
What is this?

9
35
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:05,069
Can't you see, it's a lunchbox.

10
39
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:07,211
Lunchbox?

11
43
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:51,750
Is it good??

12
47
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:57,889
This...

13
51
00:03:58,843 --> 00:04:00,415
- You made this? 
- What??

14
56
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:05,621
Yeah...if it's good, I'll bring it again next time.!

15
60
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:12,648
You must be thirsty.  Do you want me to go get you some water?

16
64
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,295
I remember.!

17
68
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:28,400
The person that I forgot is you, right?

18
72
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:48,305
Here you go. Thank you.  Come back again.

19
76
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:51,200
Welco ...

20
80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,313
- One order of abalone porridge.
- And one order of pumpkin porridge.

21
85
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:56,208
Sunbae...

22
89
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,562
What brings you guys here?

23
93
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:01,105
Can't you see?  We came to eat porridge.

24
97
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,046
- Ahh, I'm so full. 
- Me too.

25
102
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,440
Now tell us, is there something wrong?

26
106
00:05:56,485 --> 00:06:02,101
For Geum Jan Di who can't even take care of her boyfriend because of her job...we brought some news.

27
110
00:06:02,972 --> 00:06:04,269
Huh?

28
114
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:06,777
Jun Pyo finally got discharged.

29
118
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:09,219
R..Really?

30
122
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:12,576
How can you guys say something so important after you're done eating?

31
126
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:14,666
Hurry up and go.

32
130
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,817
I'll be back.

33
134
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:40,815
Sunbae, you're not going? 
 No. I came here because of you.

34
139
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:21,675
They look happy...the pottery that's in there. 
Instead of suffering from the heat, they look happy.

35
144
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,897
Why?

36
148
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:29,690
Because if they endure it, once they come out, they will be loved.  They hold that hope.

37
152
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:32,720
That's so like Ga Eul.

38
156
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:41,367
You can tell me now.  I'm ready.

39
160
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:47,823
You have something to say, right?

40
164
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:51,816
Would you like the bad news first again?

41
168
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,257
....leaving.

42
172
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:08,873
If you think about it, that might not be such bad news for you.

43
176
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:13,576
Where to? 
 Sweden.

44
181
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:20,158
When....no 
- or how long?
- Soon

45
187
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,554
Probably about four to five years.

46
191
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:32,815
That's great.  
 You'll be an even greater potter.

47
196
00:08:37,012 --> 00:08:43,904
If you think about it, this can also be good news.  So what's the other news?

48
200
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:50,460
When I come back....

49
204
00:08:51,993 --> 00:08:54,849
you'll be the first one I look for.

50
208
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:57,801
Sunbae...

51
212
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:05,220
I mean, that's only if by that time, you still haven't found your soulmate.

52
216
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,817
Add more firewood! 
The pottery has to be 1300 degrees C!

53
221
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:39,153
Goo Joon Pyo, congratulations on your discharge.....
Oh, it's Jan Di Unnie. Hi, JanDi Unnie!

54
226
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:45,135
Oh, hi.  Yoo Mi, you're here, too.

55
230
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:48,374
What are you doing here?  Ji Hoo is not here.

56
234
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:53,155
I heard that you were discharged.  I just wanted to say congratulations.

57
238
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:57,152
How nosy you are!

58
242
00:09:57,152 --> 00:10:01,243
Why don't you just take care of your own boyfriend.  Does Ji Hoo know that you're going around like this?

59
246
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:04,391
- Hey, watch what you say.
- What?

60
251
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:10,029
Ji Hoo Sunbae has no reason to hear such things from you.  
Then why don't you behave so it's not so embarrassing.

61
256
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:18,153
Fine.  I shouldn't have come.  You just take care of youself.

62
260
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:22,803
What's wrong with you, Oppa.  You're so mean.

63
264
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,987
Unnie, don't go.  Tea's coming.  Oppa's tea is really good.  Have some tea.

64
268
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:35,995
Tea is ready. 
Bring it here, please.

65
273
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:39,731
Unnie, come sit over here.

66
277
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:56,292
Oh, it looks so good.

67
281
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:02,692
Ah!
I'll do it myself

68
286
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:11,566
Is it good?
I spilled it all over.

69
291
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,071
You should try it.

70
295
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:29,217
Mmmm, tastes good.

71
299
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,447
I'm leaving

72
303
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:48,391
You...

73
307
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:50,624
don't come back again.

74
311
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:59,180
Whenever I see you, my mood turns sour.  You get on my nerves.

75
315
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:05,266
I get it.  I'm sorry.  I won't come back again!

76
319
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:21,175
Unni!

77
323
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:29,116
Is the person Joon Pyo oppa has to remember by chance you?

78
327
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:44,397
I'm right. But as you can see, seeing you isn't good for him. 
Whenever he sees you, his condition worsens.

79
332
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:48,282
So, from this moment on, it's best if you don't come here anymore.

80
336
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,276
But don't worry.  Every chance I get, I'll work really hard to try and get him to remember you.  Take care, then.

81
340
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,079
- Make me that. 
- What?

82
345
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,097
- That lunchbox that you made last time.
- Lunchbox?

83
350
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:31,810
The rolled eggs that you made for me at the hospital.  Make that for me again.

84
354
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:34,657
Ahhh, that.  Okay, oppa.

85
358
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:40,378
But there are so many more tasty foods to eat here.  Why do you want to eat that?

86
362
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,992
I'm sorry.

87
366
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:04,123
-Sunbae? 
  -Don't escape.

88
371
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:08,826
- Let me go. 
- No!

89
376
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:11,973
You can't back off now.

90
380
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,960
Jan Di!

91
384
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,390
It's all over now.  It's useless now...

92
388
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:55,325
I believed that even though he lost his memory, even if we had to start all over, that he'd recognize me.

93
392
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:59,006
But, the fact is I was wrong.

94
396
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:01,358
-That's not it.  
 -No.

95
401
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:05,302
I may be upset and feel cheated, but I have to accept it.

96
405
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:14,495
The Goo JoonPyo that I liked, the Goo Joon Pyo who loved me, doesn't exist anymore.

97
409
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,102
I told you, you can't become like the little mermaid

98
413
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:23,883
I refuse to accept that you two will break up over something as nonsensical as this.

99
417
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:27,675
i can't accept it

100
421
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,026
It's not because of Yoo Mi.

101
425
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,198
Ultimately, Goo Joon Pyo and Geum Jan Di...

102
429
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:53,733
It's the end for us.

103
433
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:43,165
Eat it all

104
437
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,431
What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

105
441
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:10,054
-This isn't it.  
-Huh?

106
446
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:12,544
This isn't the same flavor as before.

107
450
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:19,145
Did you really make that other one?

108
454
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:24,023
Uh, of course.  Of course I made it.  Who else would have?

109
458
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:27,028
It's just that each time you make it, it tastes a little different.

110
462
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,019
Next time, I'll make it just right.

111
466
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:37,817
Is there something making you feel bad?

112
470
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:38,932
That girl...

113
474
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:51,171
Jan Di or Japcho ("lawn" or "weed"), that girl's expression...

114
478
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:56,598
I can't erase it from my mind.

115
482
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:57,806
You're too much.

116
486
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:04,467
How could you?  From the time you were in the hospital until now, I was the one who has been at your side.

117
490
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:10,580
But that unnie who pops up every now and then to irritate you gets stuck in your mind?

118
494
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:16,771
Your friends treat me like crap and always take that unnie's side.

119
498
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:22,910
And that unnie's boyfriend treats me as though I have some disease, completely ignoring me.

120
502
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:30,457
But, for you...because I was worried about you, I put up with it all...

121
506
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:35,462
But, if you act like this too, 
then what am I supposed to do?

122
511
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:47,917
Hey!

123
515
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:16,212
What's the matter?

124
519
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:29,567
<i>Invitation: "Surprise pool party thrown by Goo Joon Pyo and Jang Yoo Mi"</i>

125
523
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:28,588
Unnie, you came!

126
527
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:34,361
- Have you been well?
- I'm glad you came, I have something to report to you.

127
532
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:35,880
Report?

128
536
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:40,003
Oppa still can't remember you.

129
540
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:44,151
- Is that so?
- And one other thing...

130
545
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:51,053
I'm sorry for you, but I like Joon Pyo oppa.

131
549
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:52,998
What?

132
553
00:21:52,998 --> 00:22:00,248
It's not that I did it on purpose; it just happened.  I like him so much that I can't part from him.

133
557
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:06,857
Oppa feels the same way as I do.  Sorry.  I know you'll understand, right?

134
561
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,868
A person's heart can't be controlled the way we want.

135
565
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:19,425
Oh, look at the time.

136
569
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:24,336
I need to tell everyone the reason for this party.

137
573
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,065
Reason?

138
577
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:29,534
Unnie, come over in a little bit.

139
581
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:02,553
Don't collapse now.

140
585
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,662
Let's go

141
589
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:07,987
hear what they have to say.

142
593
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,032
We invited you all here because we have a special announcement to make.

143
597
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:24,496
We, Goo Joon Pyo and Jang Yoo Mi, have decided to go study in America next month.

144
601
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:25,567
What?

145
605
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:27,683
What is that girl talking about?

146
609
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,224
Study abroad?

147
613
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:34,841
I'm going to continue my studies and oppa will carry on with his business.

148
617
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:41,188
Don't feel too sad while we're gone, and be happy until we meet again.

149
621
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:48,555
That girl is something else.

150
625
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,361
It's a shock to get hit in the back of the head like this.

151
629
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,836
Let's go.

152
633
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:23,851
I'll get  you a glass of warm water.

153
637
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:08,359
Goo Joon Pyo!

154
641
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:17,580
Do you remember this?

155
645
00:25:18,494 --> 00:25:19,879
What is it?

156
649
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:24,450
You don't remember the names on this?

157
653
00:25:40,227 --> 00:25:41,662
JJ

158
657
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:44,251
How would I know something like this?

159
661
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:48,813
I'll return it.  Take it back.

160
665
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,547
Why would I take something like this?

161
669
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:53,159
If you want to get rid of it, throw it away yourself.

162
673
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:58,470
Yeah.

163
677
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:28,005
Goo Joon Pyo.  I'll ask just once more, just one more question.

164
681
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:29,428
What now?

165
685
00:26:29,428 --> 00:26:31,037
Do you know how to swim?

166
689
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:32,630
Swim?

167
693
00:26:33,781 --> 00:26:35,098
I don't swim.

168
697
00:26:35,098 --> 00:26:36,418
Don't swim or can't swim?

169
701
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:41,051
Because of a bad experience when I was a kid, I don't swim.  I've never done it.

170
705
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:46,475
No.  You do know how to swim

171
709
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:52,470
What are you?  Who do you think you are to blab off about me.

172
713
00:26:53,772 --> 00:27:00,320
You don't fear anything in the world, but you're so scared of bugs, you shake.

173
717
00:27:00,842 --> 00:27:07,843
You're the idiot who would rather his ribs all break than see one finger on his woman hurt.

174
721
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:19,807
You're the idiot who doesn't know the difference between "privacy" and "pride" who insists that the 38th parallel are train tracks.

175
725
00:27:21,322 --> 00:27:23,908
You freak out when it comes to kids, but...

176
729
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:31,301
you want to be a devoted father...

177
733
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,305
who will go out and look at the stars with his son.

178
737
00:27:36,761 --> 00:27:39,216
You're a lonely but loving guy.

179
741
00:27:40,052 --> 00:27:41,231
Who do you think you are?

180
745
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:43,961
That's who you are, Goo Joon Pyo.

181
749
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:46,530
I'm asking who you are?

182
753
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,490
You call it out.

183
757
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,023
My name.

184
761
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,161
Geum Jan Di.

185
765
00:30:00,094 --> 00:30:01,505
Jan Di yah!!

186
769
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:47,427
Geum Jan Di...wake up!

187
773
00:31:06,028 --> 00:31:08,535
Jan Di....Geum Jan Di!!

188
777
00:31:22,203 --> 00:31:23,838
Are you all right?

189
781
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:32,385
Do you remember now?

190
785
00:31:33,573 --> 00:31:38,811
Geum Jan Di...  If you scare me like that one more time you're dead!

191
789
00:31:40,053 --> 00:31:41,815
You remember....

192
793
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,316
I'm sorry...

193
797
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:48,595
I'm sorry...

194
801
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:55,869
Say it again....  My name.

195
805
00:31:59,273 --> 00:32:00,101
Jan Di...

196
809
00:32:43,817 --> 00:32:48,322
It seems like just yesterday that our Jan Di started high school, yet it's already graduation.

197
813
00:32:49,323 --> 00:32:56,114
I'm sorry mom that I can't get a job or go to college like others do.

198
817
00:32:56,114 --> 00:33:00,281
Noona, you don't have to take a test to go to Shinhwa University, isn't it the same for medical school?

199
821
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:05,796
If I want to get a scholarship, I have to take the test.

200
825
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:12,293
No, your life has been full of obstacles.  Now I want you to do what you want to do.

201
829
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:15,897
And by the way, what are you wearing to the graduation?

202
833
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:17,882
I'm not going...

203
837
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:19,467
Why would I....

204
841
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:23,238
Aren't you a graduate of ShinHwa?  
Why wouldn't you go?

205
846
00:33:26,174 --> 00:33:29,976
Please don't concern yourself.

206
850
00:33:34,422 --> 00:33:37,152
<i>Come out to the front of your house.</i>

207
854
00:33:57,405 --> 00:33:58,807
Congratulations on your graduation.

208
858
00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:01,610
Thanks!

209
862
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:05,042
Do you really need to go to medical school?

210
866
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:10,551
Why?  What are you about to say?

211
870
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:13,357
There's no guarantee that studying for another year is going to help.

212
874
00:34:13,357 --> 00:34:14,432
And?

213
878
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:15,689
If any,

214
882
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:18,716
think about it...a doctor like you?

215
886
00:34:18,716 --> 00:34:20,292
You'd probably cut them up.

216
890
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,229
What?

217
894
00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:25,099
Even without a scalpel (surgical knife) you cut people up.

218
898
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:31,973
You...didn't really come to congratulate me on my graduation, did you?  
You came to make fun of me, right?

219
903
00:34:38,346 --> 00:34:40,414
Ah, hey!

220
907
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:44,452
Hey, Geum Jan Di, tomorrow, you...

221
911
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,541
Got it?

222
915
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:56,698
If you're late again this time, you're dead!

223
919
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:02,237
Go on in and sleep.

224
923
00:35:51,954 --> 00:35:52,825
It's F4!!

225
927
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:33,594
Grandpa!

226
931
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:37,199
I'll throw the garbage out and then get your tea

227
935
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,866
Oh, okay.

228
939
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:44,806
That little rascal...

229
943
00:37:56,778 --> 00:37:58,947
Geum Jan Di! Why did you come this late?

230
947
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:02,083
Oh, well, I...

231
951
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:06,420
You weren't planning to just skip this last event, were you?

232
955
00:38:08,757 --> 00:38:12,526
We're not even high schoolers so why do you think we're here?

233
959
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:13,928
Huh?

234
963
00:38:13,928 --> 00:38:18,266
The great F4 have been waiting all day to dance with Geum Jandi.

235
967
00:38:22,437 --> 00:38:28,376
Miss Jan Di, would you do me the great honor of dancing with me?

236
971
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:31,879
- With me? 
- Let's go.

237
976
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:33,314
No, just a minute...

238
980
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:09,850
Woo Bin sunbae, who was the backbone and support of F4...

239
984
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:16,390
I know that you are always one step behind, offering your heart in support.

240
988
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,625
I know that now.

241
992
00:39:33,274 --> 00:39:39,946
Although you act cold and mean,
in reality, you are warmer and more pure than others.

242
997
00:39:39,946 --> 00:39:45,152
Thanks to you, I think that Ga Eul has experienced a beautiful love.

243
1001
00:39:55,496 --> 00:39:57,098
Don't you think it's time to give others a turn?

244
1005
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:00,301
Rascal...

245
1009
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:09,610
What can I do since my clothes are like this?

246
1013
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,812
It's perfect.

247
1017
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:14,452
Geum JanDi's combat uniform

248
1021
00:40:14,452 --> 00:40:18,018
Don't you think it's the perfect outfit for Geum Jan Di to finish her high school life?

249
1025
00:40:48,605 --> 00:40:52,549
As if having falling into a wonderland like Alice....

250
1029
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:59,759
It will go to the emergency bell, the possibility which it will meet you there is a fact.
 Do you know how comforting it is Sunbae?

251
1034
00:41:00,798 --> 00:41:04,875
You're like someone sent from the heaven to me like bonus....

252
1038
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:08,144
I'll never be able to forget you...

253
1042
00:41:09,507 --> 00:41:13,369
My soulmate...Ji Hoo Sunbae.

254
1046
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,302
Thank you.

255
1050
00:41:21,127 --> 00:41:22,251
What happened to Jun Pyo?

256
1054
00:41:23,034 --> 00:41:26,639
His phone is off.  Do you think something's happened?

257
1058
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:36,069
You....tomorrow.....

258
1062
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:41,350
All right?

259
1066
00:41:44,063 --> 00:41:46,884
Saturday.  4 pm.  In front of NamSan Tower.

260
1070
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:54,956
I...have to...leave first....
You're crazy until the end.

261
1075
00:41:54,956 --> 00:41:56,236
Geum Jan Di!

262
1079
00:42:29,954 --> 00:42:31,998
Didn't I say that if you were late, you'd be dead?

263
1083
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:41,349
You're even late on a day like this...
You always just do whatever you want.

264
1088
00:43:21,272 --> 00:43:23,093
Compared to grassland management

265
1092
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,370
Come here.

266
1096
00:43:39,101 --> 00:43:42,450
It's a coffee that costs $36.3. Drink it up!

267
1100
00:43:48,766 --> 00:43:49,686
Let's go.

268
1104
00:43:58,323 --> 00:43:59,612
It's been a long time since we've been here huh?

269
1108
00:44:02,094 --> 00:44:05,464
Is it open??

270
1112
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:08,050
Why don't I see anyone here??

271
1116
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,312
I rented it. 
What?

272
1121
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:19,936
I basically bought it until the morning. And I also have something to show you.

273
1125
00:44:27,972 --> 00:44:31,208
Come here.
I told you there's something I want to show you!

274
1130
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:33,963
What's wrong with you...there's something I want to show you...

275
1134
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:40,677
You.  Do you already know?

276
1138
00:44:43,393 --> 00:44:47,582
You.  Do you intend to make it so that I can't get married?

277
1142
00:44:47,582 --> 00:44:50,447
You just need to marry me.  Who were you going to marry???

278
1146
00:44:52,641 --> 00:44:56,272
Move.  Just move aside.

279
1150
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:58,936
<i>Goo Joon Pyo loves Geum Jan Di 
 Our first night together!!! <3</i>

280
1155
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,183
It's still here!!

281
1159
00:45:02,637 --> 00:45:04,291
Now you can not get married.

282
1163
00:45:09,513 --> 00:45:11,148
Geum Jan Di.

283
1167
00:45:12,442 --> 00:45:14,479
Listen carefully to what I have to say...

284
1171
00:45:16,595 --> 00:45:19,573
So ominous... W-...W-...What is it now???

285
1175
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:22,238
Us......

286
1179
00:45:26,626 --> 00:45:27,697
Let's get married...

287
1183
00:45:29,882 --> 00:45:31,250
Married?

288
1187
00:45:31,635 --> 00:45:34,907
Yes, married.

289
1191
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:40,818
Why are you suddenly joking around like that??

290
1195
00:45:40,818 --> 00:45:42,273
I'm not joking

291
1199
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:50,084
I've just barely graduated from high school.

292
1203
00:45:52,635 --> 00:45:53,924
I....

293
1207
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:56,771
...have to go to the U.S.

294
1211
00:45:58,429 --> 00:45:59,819
U.S?

295
1215
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:02,362
This time, it's not because of my mom.....

296
1219
00:46:02,884 --> 00:46:04,242
and not because of the business...

297
1223
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,534
It was my decision.

298
1227
00:46:22,653 --> 00:46:27,727
Killing off a living dad...forcing an offspring to marry...

299
1231
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:32,023
or having to lobby all the time.  I don't want that kind of corporation.

300
1235
00:46:33,764 --> 00:46:34,780
I'm....

301
1239
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,541
going to try my best.

302
1243
00:46:40,596 --> 00:46:45,947
So if I can save the corporation then that's great...

303
1247
00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:48,285
But if I can't...

304
1251
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:51,576
then I'll shut it down with my own hands.

305
1255
00:46:55,419 --> 00:46:57,429
How long will it take?

306
1259
00:46:57,429 --> 00:46:58,708
4 years.

307
1263
00:47:00,524 --> 00:47:02,365
At least it will be 4 years...

308
1267
00:47:04,402 --> 00:47:05,930
That long?

309
1271
00:47:12,836 --> 00:47:16,073
So.....come with me then.

310
1275
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:31,178
I can't..

311
1279
00:47:38,995 --> 00:47:39,897
What???

312
1283
00:47:41,698 --> 00:47:43,429
Why can't you??

313
1287
00:47:46,236 --> 00:47:48,339
When you went to Macau.....

314
1291
00:47:53,077 --> 00:47:55,212
I made a decision, too..

315
1295
00:47:57,147 --> 00:48:00,174
About my dreams and future.

316
1299
00:48:02,786 --> 00:48:06,724
What is it that I want and what is it that I want to do.

317
1303
00:48:09,026 --> 00:48:10,427
Like you.....

318
1307
00:48:11,462 --> 00:48:18,502
the thing that I want to try my best at , and do my best...is right here.

319
1311
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:20,904
So???

320
1315
00:48:24,374 --> 00:48:25,476
Have a good trip..

321
1319
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:27,110
Whatt??

322
1323
00:48:29,813 --> 00:48:32,049
I said, "Have a good trip."

323
1327
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:40,724
4 years later, if you come back as a great man, I will think about it again then..

324
1331
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:47,064
Geum Jan Di.

325
1335
00:48:48,065 --> 00:48:49,401
Are  you serious?

326
1339
00:48:52,602 --> 00:48:56,774
You are going to regret letting me go.

327
1343
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:03,547
Hey, you are the one who is going to regret it!

328
1347
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:09,153
Alright, you win.

329
1351
00:49:15,025 --> 00:49:16,827
I already know...

330
1355
00:49:19,029 --> 00:49:23,567
that I would regret until I die for letting you go

331
1359
00:49:29,439 --> 00:49:30,507
Goo Joon Pyo

332
1363
00:49:31,842 --> 00:49:37,648
You might not be as stupid as you look

333
1367
00:49:39,516 --> 00:49:40,851
You wanna die?

334
1371
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,015
4 years later

335
1375
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:05,010
<i>Shinhwa group's managing Director, Goo Joon Pyo covers 3 international economic magazines.</i>

336
1379
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:16,530
Today, we have Goo Joon Pyo, the executive director of ShinHwa Group who succeed in establishing a strategic alliance with Global Soft Inc. this month

337
1383
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:23,195
which has been internationally recognized and brought Korea into the spotlight.

338
1387
00:51:23,195 --> 00:51:25,960
Thank you for coming on our show.
Hello.

339
1392
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,786
I heard not too long ago 
that you are the first Korean to be on the cover of 3 international economic magazines.

340
1397
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:33,719
Congratulations.
-Thank you.

341
1402
00:51:57,803 --> 00:52:08,388
We'll change the topic a little bit now. 
The viewers, especially the women in Korea, would like to hear some personal information.

342
1407
00:52:08,388 --> 00:52:13,311
Of course, you're managing an international company, but you're also in the prime of your 20s

343
1411
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:18,583
So I'm sure you're lonely sometimes. How do you overcome that?

344
1415
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:25,284
Dating or love. It seems like you're curious about these aspects of my life.

345
1419
00:52:25,284 --> 00:52:28,001
You certainly have a faster understanding of things than others.

346
1423
00:52:28,777 --> 00:52:34,923
Yes. Well, to say I wasn't lonely or had it hard is probably a lie.

347
1427
00:52:35,446 --> 00:52:42,943
But because of a promise I made with someone, I was able to rely on that and endure it.

348
1431
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:49,212
Just watching you talk about it. It shows that you have someone special in your heart.

349
1435
00:52:49,552 --> 00:52:50,650
Yes.

350
1439
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:55,530
A lover?  Lately, there have been a lot of rumors about your marriage.

351
1443
00:52:55,530 --> 00:53:00,497
Since you're already here. How about you tell us a little about who she is?

352
1447
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:07,139
Is that a grape?
-Yes

353
1452
00:54:10,892 --> 00:54:13,483
You're still putting too much pressure in your hands.

354
1456
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:17,731
Yi Jung Sunbae.

355
1460
00:54:18,824 --> 00:54:19,833
Hi

356
1464
00:54:23,214 --> 00:54:29,867
Who is he? Is he teacher's boyfriend?
Mister did you just come back from another country ?

357
1469
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,988
Oh, how did you know?

358
1473
00:54:31,988 --> 00:54:35,304
Then, did you just come back from Sweden?

359
1477
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:37,763
Little miss, you're really amazing.

360
1481
00:54:37,763 --> 00:54:45,379
Then you're him! Our teacher said her boyfriend was there.

361
1485
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,480
You can't tell him that!

362
1489
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:18,319
Hey wait! Wait! Wait!

363
1493
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:19,699
Thank you!

364
1497
00:55:21,428 --> 00:55:28,768
Hey, third repeater. Are you late even on a day like today?
Not a day goes by that you don't cause trouble..

365
1502
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:31,616
I'm sorry, Sunbae-nim. I'm sorry.

366
1506
00:55:41,694 --> 00:55:43,841
Do you think it'll end like that?

367
1510
00:55:50,816 --> 00:55:52,096
Sunbae!

368
1514
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,164
Hey, Geum Jan Di! 
-Yes.

369
1519
00:56:20,164 --> 00:56:21,628
Can't you do this properly?

370
1523
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,995
What is this?

371
1527
00:56:22,995 --> 00:56:25,559
I'm sorry. 
 Do it again. Hurry!
-I'm sorry Sunbae.

372
1533
00:56:55,628 --> 00:56:56,749
You came?

373
1537
00:57:06,272 --> 00:57:08,975
By the look on your face, it seems like you made another mistake.

374
1541
00:57:11,116 --> 00:57:14,538
Sunbae, since you entered on time, you're already in the graduating class…

375
1545
00:57:15,574 --> 00:57:21,688
When am I, a third-year ever going to finish and in what millennium will I become a doctor?

376
1549
00:57:23,255 --> 00:57:27,927
The future sure looks dark.
You're not worried about flunking?

377
1554
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:29,863
Sunbae!

378
1558
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:37,137
It's because of you that I've lasted this long as an outcast.

379
1562
00:57:37,752 --> 00:57:43,309
When I think about what I'm going to do when you go to the hospital, it looks dark..

380
1566
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:45,937
Then, should I repeat too?

381
1570
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:51,551
Aigoo, that's all right.
That's scarier than a flunking joke.

382
1575
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,819
It's not a joke.

383
1579
00:57:55,521 --> 00:58:00,148
Sunbae, you have to hurry and become a doctor so you can reopen your grandfather's clinic..

384
1583
00:58:01,654 --> 00:58:07,233
That's why you went back and studied..
That wasn't the only reason.

385
1588
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:09,435
What?

386
1592
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,674
Doctor prince, my throat hurts.

387
1596
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,545
Doctor prince?

388
1600
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:28,021
Sae Byul is going to grow up and marry Doctor Prince later in the future.

389
1604
00:58:30,223 --> 00:58:34,894
We'll get married next time. Right now, say ‘ah'.

390
1608
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:47,173
Commoner, can you hear me? Geum Jan Di respond.

391
1612
00:58:48,307 --> 00:58:53,446
Are you there Geum Jan Di? 
If you're there, come meet me on the beach. 
Goo Joon Pyo?.

392
1618
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:15,634
Goo Joon Pyo?

393
1622
00:59:28,247 --> 00:59:31,351
You took 5 minutes! Can't you walk faster?!

394
1626
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,999
Goo Joon Pyo.

395
1630
00:59:48,601 --> 00:59:49,936
What's going on?

396
1634
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:54,674
What do you mean?
Goo Joon Pyo has come back for Geum Jan Di.

397
1639
00:59:57,643 --> 01:00:04,250
Seeing you wearing this white gown, I guess ugly ducklings can become swans after all.

398
1643
01:00:06,619 --> 01:00:08,621
It's Goo Joon Pyo.

399
1647
01:00:11,257 --> 01:00:12,926
You're really Goo Joon Pyo.

400
1651
01:00:23,503 --> 01:00:27,941
I missed you.
Enough to die.

401
1656
01:00:30,142 --> 01:00:33,826
I'm not going to let you go again.

402
1660
01:00:40,827 --> 01:00:44,893
You promised, didn't you? When I returned, you'd take responsibility for me.

403
1664
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:49,961
Look here, Mr. Goo Joon Pyo with a bad memory.

404
1668
01:00:50,588 --> 01:00:58,110
I said when you returned in four years, I would think about it. 
I never said I would take responsibility.

405
1673
01:01:00,106 --> 01:01:03,074
Your memory is bad too, but you remember that well.

406
1677
01:01:03,074 --> 01:01:06,562
In my memory, there was another condition.

407
1681
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,177
What?

408
1685
01:01:08,177 --> 01:01:12,992
The one about if you come back as a really amazing man.

409
1689
01:01:12,992 --> 01:01:16,240
Can you really say that in front of the great Goo Joon Pyo?

410
1693
01:01:37,478 --> 01:01:39,097
Geum Jan Di.

411
1697
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:44,061
Please marry this great Goo Joon Pyo.

412
1701
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,745
I object to that proposal!

413
1705
01:01:56,119 --> 01:01:57,962
I also object!

414
1709
01:01:57,962 --> 01:02:03,679
Me too!
You guys can't do that so easily without our permission.
