1
3
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:52,270
What's this noise?

2
7
00:01:57,574 --> 00:02:00,394
Wow, sounds like she is going to be fired.

3
11
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:02,042
How could a tone deaf person like that...

4
15
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:03,842
That person...

5
19
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:20,038
Do you know her?

6
23
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:24,722
No way.  She's not Korean is she?

7
27
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:27,379
What an embarrassment to our nation.

8
31
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,312
That's right, she's Korean.

9
35
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:31,402
She's really cool though.

10
39
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,361
How do you know her?

11
43
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,932
She saved my life.

12
47
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:41,119
What? Didn't we save your life?

13
51
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:16,258
- Hello. 
- Welcome.

14
56
00:03:16,258 --> 00:03:19,780
It's such a pleasure to finally meet you.

15
60
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,856
- Hello 
- Hello.

16
65
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:30,104
You must be very happy with such a good son.

17
69
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:35,532
I was also very excited to meet Jae Kyung.  It's unfortunate we won't be able to meet her today.

18
73
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:40,300
She's playing around by herself in Macau right now.

19
77
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,806
We already gave up because she really likes to do everything her way.

20
81
00:03:45,377 --> 00:03:49,882
I've heard that she's extraordinary. I'm looking forward to seeing her more and more.

21
85
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:52,094
Please don't anticipate too much.

22
89
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:56,077
Madam, the preparations are ready.

23
93
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,710
Then, shall we go?

24
97
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:02,530
Shin Hwa group's long-cherished ambition for 2020 is

25
101
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,722
to build a 2nd Cotai resort district in Incheon in Korea.

26
105
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:14,324
It will be the ultimate resort city in Asia complete with extravagant hotels and additional facilities.

27
109
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:18,173
In order to complete this project,

28
113
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:26,967
we absolutely need the cooperation of JK, which has achieved many successes in constructing new resorts in cities such as Las Vegas, Macau and Dubai.

29
117
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:36,684
If we combine Shin Hwa's infrastructure as Korea's No. 1 group and JK's knowledge and skills in the field,

30
121
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:41,478
this blue print will become a reality much faster and

31
125
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:44,496
create a new history for Korea.

32
129
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,036
Wow I'm so hungry.
Let's go get something to eat.

33
134
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:15,759
Okay!  Jan Di, you can count on it.
There's a killer restaurant here.

34
139
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,859
let's go!

35
143
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,740
What's wrong? Is there no room?

36
147
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,249
Don't worry buddies. As long as we mention Joon Pyo's name, it's automatically "okay".

37
151
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:47,400
Let's go somewhere else.

38
155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,267
Why? Craving some Italian food while were in Italy?

39
159
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:58,500
-You're right. There's a killer Italian chef here too, right?

40
163
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,899
Come on, guys.

41
167
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:02,209
There's lots of rooms ...

42
171
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:25,000
<i> connecting . . .</i>

43
175
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,900
<i> A photo has arrived.  Do you want to check it out?
Connect</i>

44
180
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:58,060
Let's have a toast.

45
184
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,736
For the cooperation between Shin Hwa Group and JK Group.

46
188
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,527
cheers!

47
192
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,545
Are you okay?

48
196
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,180
About what?

49
200
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,800
Coming here,

50
204
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:13,841
do you regret it?

51
208
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,087
When would I ever get the chance to come here again?

52
212
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:23,924
It was my dream to go on a vacation alone.

53
216
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:28,130
What's your plan?

54
220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,074
I don't have anything planned.

55
224
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:39,989
I just wanted to see his face and say, "How've you been?"

56
228
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:42,167
"I've been well."

57
232
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:46,207
Just saying hello would be nice.

58
236
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,797
Isn't it strange?

59
240
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:52,600
What?

60
244
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,432
It feels like our relationship is something of the past.

61
248
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:08,384
If Joon Pyo is really pretending not to know me, then I wonder if I've just been dreaming.

62
252
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:20,531
It's not a dream.

63
256
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:24,439
If it was all a dream, it wouldn't be so hard.

64
260
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:27,967
Huh?

65
264
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,798
After letting you leave, I realized

66
268
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:34,664
that I was unable to do anything all day.

67
272
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:40,867
When I came to my senses, I was on the plane.

68
276
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:48,038
So, it's not a dream.

69
280
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:56,200
Since right now, you're right here in front of me.

70
284
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,671
Sleep well.

71
288
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:42,033
"J"

72
292
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:27,208
Ah . . .oh . . . okay!   That's enough.
 Go. Stop!

73
297
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:42,639
You, if you just weren't the chief manager,
 I'd cut you instantly.

74
302
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:45,325
Keep it up.

75
306
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:52,430
At ten there's an inspection at the construction site.  At eleven, you'll have to take the jet 
to the Singapore Office.

76
311
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,000
At 5:00, you have a private meeting with the mayor of Macau . . .

77
315
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:58,377
And . . .

78
319
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,400
And what?  Why did you stop in the middle of a sentence?

79
323
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,901
If you could make some time to meet your F4 friends . . .

80
327
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:10,027
There is no time.

81
331
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:12,746
They've been waiting since yesterday.

82
335
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:17,581
Do I have that much free time?

83
339
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:21,417
Should I just put aside my schedule for today and hang out with them?

84
343
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:25,884
So tell me, is it okay to just completely clear my schedule so I can hang out with them?

85
347
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:28,941
No.

86
351
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,546
Sheesh!  What kind of lawn is this? (Jan Di's name means "lawn", so it's a play on words)

87
355
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:42,838
Nothing's going right.

88
359
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,391
<i>Master Yi Jung</i>

89
363
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,648
Yes? It's me.

90
367
00:13:55,908 --> 00:14:00,082
What kind of mayor wants to meet at a place like this? Did he used to be an athlete?

91
371
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:05,228
I'm sorry. 
It's not something you should have to apologize for.

92
376
00:14:09,643 --> 00:14:12,817
Hey yo!  Have you been well?

93
380
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:20,248
Long time no see. 

You guys came?

94
386
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:23,309
If we want to meet Shin Hwa Group's heir, the busiest man in the world . . .

95
390
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:30,201
Then we have to come to you, other wise we'd never be able to see you. 
 It's nice to see you.

96
395
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,188
Really?

97
399
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:37,332
Because it doesn't seem like you're all that glad.

98
403
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:42,314
What's wrong?  We haven't seen each other in so long.

99
407
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,804
Geum Jan Di came with us too.

100
411
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:51,869
Actually, that's not quite right.  She came before us, to see you.  You haven't seen her, have you?

101
415
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:54,790
Why should I see her?

102
419
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,715
what?

103
423
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,633
There isn't anything left between me and that kid.

104
427
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:18,859
So then, Goo Joon Pyo, are you saying you purposely didn't contact Geum Jan Di?

105
431
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:23,552
Whether it was on purpose or not, I don't have time to think about things like that.

106
435
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:26,260
Things like that? 
 Are you serious, Joon Pyo?

107
440
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,951
We finally meet and all you guys want to talk about are childish things like that?

108
444
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:33,910
How can you still call yourself a man?

109
448
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,067
What do you mean? 
 You guys meet and break up with girls too.

110
453
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,410
So, what's wrong with me doing the same thing?

111
457
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,422
Even if I meet and break up dozens of times, I don't do it the way you did!

112
461
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:44,243
Yi Jung, calm down!

113
465
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,095
Let go!

114
469
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:49,692
You! 
What did you say when we tried to stop you in the past?

115
474
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:54,080
You said a real man is someone that's responsible from the beginning to the end. 
 You really believed that?

116
479
00:15:55,643 --> 00:16:00,689
By chance, did you guys think that she and I would be together forever?

117
483
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,731
Whose fault is it that Geum Jan Di can't swim anymore?!

118
487
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:15,657
Stand up! 
Yi Jung, calm down. 
Does it look like I can calm down?
DO YOU HEAR WHAT THIS BASTARD IS SAYING?!

119
494
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,010
You!  Did you start that relationship thinking something like this wouldn't happen?

120
498
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,368
I warned you not to be so rash, you cowardly bastard!!

121
502
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:33,930
What's with you guys? 
Did you guys quit being my friends so you could become a group of Jan Di's protectors?

122
507
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:41,086
Goo Joon Pyo . . . 
If you came here as my friends, then play and go.
 But if you came to just to talk about Geum Jan Di

123
513
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:42,929
then leave immediately.

124
517
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:50,452
How is it that you've changed so much?

125
521
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,700
700,000. 
 What?

126
526
00:16:56,748 --> 00:17:04,526
In Shin Hwa Corporation, 

 those families I have to take responsibility for...

127
532
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:07,077
are about 700,000.

128
536
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:17,777
Try having 700,000 families' lives resting on your shoulders. 
 And see if you don't change.

129
541
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,670
An invaluable challenge. An unimaginable reality.

130
545
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:54,661
Asia's Venice. Shin Hwa stands for the legend.

131
549
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:04,928
Jan Di!

132
553
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:15,951
Is Joon Pyo alright...

133
557
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,803
What's wrong? Did something happen?

134
561
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:27,393
It's okay. 
Except for the fact, that guy has really changed.

135
566
00:18:27,393 --> 00:18:31,746
-Hey! 
-Geum Jan Di has to know.

136
571
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:39,070
As you know, a lot of things have happened. Stress is no joke too.

137
575
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,929
He says he won't see me?

138
579
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:49,077
You, how did you?
You knew about it?

139
584
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:06,188
You don't have to worry too much. 
No matter what it is, I came to hear it from Goo Joon Pyo himself.

140
589
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:11,339
I have to face it. 
 You really are Geum Jan Di!

141
594
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:19,316
Wow, the night air is so nice.
-  Ah, do you remember? 
- What?

142
600
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:22,277
What we used to do here when we were younger?

143
604
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:35,124
Rock, paper, scissors!

144
608
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:41,215
Rock, paper, scissors! 
 Rock, paper, scissors!

145
613
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:46,343
Ji Hoo, you go that way.  Jan Di you go that way, and I'll go this way!

146
617
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:57,811
Ten. Nine. Eight.

147
621
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:11,151
Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. ONE!

148
625
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:15,879
I'm coming to find you guys!

149
629
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:30,825
Awaiting you in Venice, The city of Lovers.

150
633
00:23:01,617 --> 00:23:05,186
As a friend, I have a favor to ask. 
 Say it. 


151
639
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:08,351
Just meet with her once.
Why should I do that?


152
645
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:12,813
I told you, it's a favor for a friend. 
And if I ask why you're asking that?


153
651
00:23:14,383 --> 00:23:19,579
Because right now, that's all I can do.

154
655
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,438
I'm going.

155
659
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:55,736
What's wrong?
 I was just about to go to the airport

156
664
00:24:55,736 --> 00:24:58,653
I decided to just say farewell here.

157
668
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:02,371
Before I leave, I have one thing I need to say.

158
672
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,025
After today, I don't think I'll be able to say it again.

159
676
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:20,108
I think it's really fortunate I got to know you, Sunbae.

160
680
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,978
I'll go now.

161
684
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:24,356
Sunbae? 
 Sorry for waking you up.


162
690
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:28,828
What's wrong? 

 There's somewhere we need to go.


163
697
00:26:28,828 --> 00:26:32,624
Right now, at this time?

164
701
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,341
I've heard of gymnastics at midnight 
 but a walk at the break of dawn?

165
706
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,955
We're here.

166
710
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:50,048
What? 
 From here, you have to go by yourself.


167
716
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:57,597
It should be there on that bridge.
The reason you came here.


168
722
00:27:56,451 --> 00:28:01,492
Hi. I came to see you.

169
726
00:28:01,492 --> 00:28:06,050
Yeah. 
 What brings you all the way here?


170
732
00:28:12,383 --> 00:28:16,121
I was worried after hearing the news about your father.

171
736
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:18,915
Thanks . . .

172
740
00:28:18,915 --> 00:28:24,376
So . . . 
 You came all this way for that?


173
746
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,026
I guess you're getting along well now.

174
750
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:32,083
What?

175
754
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:37,332
As you can see, I'm doing great and 
as you know, I'm very busy.

176
759
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:45,091
Now that you know, you can go. 
No need to worry about how I'm doing.

177
764
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,264
What? 
 Do you have anything more left to say?

178
769
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:06,224
Really . . .  
is this how you feel?

179
774
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:14,165
What did you expect? 
 Perhaps
"I'm sorry"

180
780
00:29:14,165 --> 00:29:21,871
"Forgive me," 
"I'll be back, so just wait for me" .
Were you expecting those words?

181
786
00:29:25,661 --> 00:29:28,010
Why are you being like this?

182
790
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:34,462
I've started to come to terms with reality.

183
794
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:41,983
I get it. 
 Now, I finally get it.

184
799
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:49,392
You pretending not to know me, not wanting to see me . . .

185
803
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:52,121
It was all real.

186
807
00:29:53,783 --> 00:29:58,861
So what I am to you is . . .

 I am . . . 
 A stain I want to erase.

187
814
00:30:15,423 --> 00:30:18,113
You're cruel, Goo Joon Pyo.

188
818
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,867
Really cruel.

189
822
00:30:23,717 --> 00:30:29,703
No. 
 I was always like this.

190
827
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:33,577
I was only pretending I wasn't.


191
832
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:50,243
I'm going. 

Take care.

 Just worry about yourself.


192
841
00:31:55,654 --> 00:31:58,919
Hey pretty girl, are you okay?

193
845
00:32:08,117 --> 00:32:10,048
Excuse me . . .

194
849
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:17,858
You are my special lucky lady, because you are my first  today.

195
853
00:32:19,117 --> 00:32:21,517
lucky lady?

196
857
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:40,775
Song.  Please sing a song for me.

197
861
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:43,566
No, No. It's my treat.

198
865
00:33:37,093 --> 00:33:45,294
From today on, Geum Jan Di from Grade 11B Class is officially my girlfriend.

199
869
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:04,833
Can you see it? My heart?

200
873
00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:37,881
Let go! 

Young master.

201
879
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:40,232
Please leave us alone for a while.

202
883
00:35:47,363 --> 00:35:53,633

Are you satisfied? 

 Now that you've gotten your way, are you satisfied?

203
890
00:35:53,633 --> 00:36:02,666
Well, It's not so pleasant that we still have to talk about such a little girl.

204
894
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,370
She is not just such a little girl.

205
898
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:07,739
She's the first girl . . .

206
902
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:12,729
that I, your own son,

207
906
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,293
ever loved in my entire life.

208
910
00:36:20,497 --> 00:36:24,750
Yes, that's right. Then what do you plan to do?

209
914
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,497
You want to abandon everything and run to her?

210
918
00:36:28,497 --> 00:36:33,444
You want to abandon the Shin Hwa Group's employees, your future?  Fine.

211
922
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:37,101
Have you ever thought about your father?

212
926
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:41,230
Stop

213
930
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:46,439
You may have no issue with throwing Shin Hwa Group away without a moments notice,

214
934
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:51,886
but your father, someone who tried his best for this  company until the very end. . .

215
938
00:36:51,886 --> 00:36:54,629
do you plan on throwing him away, too?

216
942
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,363
Stop it. 
What are you going to do about that Jan Di girl?

217
947
00:36:59,263 --> 00:37:02,614
Should I make her not be able to live anywhere in Korea?

218
951
00:37:02,614 --> 00:37:06,541
SHUT UP!   DIDN'T I TELL YOU TO STOP?!

219
955
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:20,520
Jan Di . . .

220
959
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,006
Don't mess with her.

221
963
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:30,339
If you break your promise 
 I'll destroy everything.

222
968
00:38:02,276 --> 00:38:07,772
Can this pretty lady buy an ice cream from me please?

223
972
00:38:07,772 --> 00:38:13,467
I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at Chinese, so . . .

224
976
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:18,012
What did you just say?

225
980
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:25,361
Ugly girl over there, please buy some ice cream.

226
984
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:29,101
Do you
 really think you can sell anything tlike that?

227
989
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:30,708
But you would still buy it, wouldn't you?

228
993
00:38:31,863 --> 00:38:36,702
How much is it? 
Um . . . Your day?

229
998
00:38:36,702 --> 00:38:41,992
Eh ? 
That's the fee for the ice cream. 
 Give me your time today.

230
1004
00:40:23,635 --> 00:40:26,282
Jan Di must be doing well, right?

231
1008
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:33,196
Don't worry. No news is good news. As soon as she meets Joon Pyo, she'll be dying of happiness.

232
1012
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:36,757
Kang San.

233
1016
00:40:36,757 --> 00:40:39,988
If your stomach hurts, hurry up and go to the bathroom. Don't hold it in.

234
1020
00:40:39,988 --> 00:40:43,148
Ow.

235
1024
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:46,361
Kang San, what's wrong? Kang San.

236
1028
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:51,751
Kang San, where does it hurt?

237
1032
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:55,297
This is strange. Kang San!

238
1036
00:40:55,297 --> 00:40:57,281
Put him on my back.

239
1040
00:40:59,197 --> 00:41:01,807
She eats well, right?
 Yes.

240
1045
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:04,363
She's sleeping well?
Yes.

241
1050
00:41:10,394 --> 00:41:13,398
Your blood pressure is good.

242
1054
00:41:18,897 --> 00:41:20,608
Hye Na,
Yes

243
1059
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:24,970
Should I give you a candy?

244
1063
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:30,452
Aigoo, you're so pretty. Handshake. See you later.

245
1067
00:41:30,452 --> 00:41:31,073
Yes.

246
1071
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:35,681
Good bye. Thank you.

247
1075
00:42:10,214 --> 00:42:14,159
Doctor!

248
1079
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,430
Is there anyone here?

249
1083
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,255
Please save my son!
Is there a doctor here?

250
1088
00:42:19,255 --> 00:42:22,936
Something's very wrong. Please look at him!

251
1092
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:38,297
This is nice.

252
1096
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:24,488
It's time. Let's go.

253
1100
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:28,436
That's mine.

254
1104
00:44:28,436 --> 00:44:30,734
I selected this first!

255
1108
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,772
I saw this first!

256
1112
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:34,783
It'd be better if you'd let go now.

257
1116
00:44:34,783 --> 00:44:37,866
I can't let go! 
I said let go!

258
1121
00:44:37,866 --> 00:44:41,001
Miss, I'm sorry.

259
1125
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:47,766
I'm very sorry, but, can you just share this once?

260
1129
00:44:48,383 --> 00:44:50,352
Wh-What did you say?

261
1133
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,231
Do you know the size?

262
1137
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:56,012
Size?

263
1141
00:45:00,017 --> 00:45:03,335
Hey, wear this for a second.

264
1145
00:45:03,335 --> 00:45:07,750
Hey! Hey! What the heck are you doing?!

265
1149
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:15,822
Hey! Hey! 
 Perfect fit.

266
1154
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:19,714
Now take them off. 
 Don't wanna!

267
1159
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:23,024
You're not taking them off?!

268
1163
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,683
Come here, come here!

269
1167
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:55,267
Who the heck is he? Is he crazy?

270
1171
00:45:56,517 --> 00:45:58,166
Are you okay?

271
1175
00:45:58,783 --> 00:46:01,536
How is it you're just getting here now?!

272
1179
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,669
They had some business so they left first.

273
1183
00:46:19,669 --> 00:46:21,685
What are you going to do?

274
1187
00:46:21,685 --> 00:46:23,658
It's time that we went back too.

275
1191
00:46:23,658 --> 00:46:25,934
Let's go on tomorrow morning's plane.

276
1195
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:39,678
What is that girl doing? 
Are you talking about Geum Jan Di?

277
1200
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:48,455
Yi Jung and Woo Bin have already left. Ji Hoo and Geum Jan Di are leaving tomorrow morning.

278
1204
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:53,027
It looks like she's finally learned her place.

279
1208
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:55,422
Where is Joon Pyo?

280
1212
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:58,199
He's been in the conference room all night.

281
1216
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:03,032
Looks like he's found his place, too.

282
1220
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:41,069
Goo Joon Pyo! Can you hear me?

283
1224
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:48,932
While you've been gone, I've been thinking of you every day . . .

284
1228
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:56,508
how is it the only memories I can recall are of the times we fought?

285
1232
00:50:00,407 --> 00:50:03,717
 But isn't it strange?

286
1236
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:09,399
The only memories I have are of us being angry and fighting, but . . .

287
1240
00:50:09,399 --> 00:50:12,547
when I think about you, I can only smile.

288
1244
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,197
Goo Joon  Pyo

289
1248
00:50:25,883 --> 00:50:28,690
You are doing well right?

290
1252
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,758
When are you coming back to fight with me again?

291
1256
00:50:39,322 --> 00:50:45,204
Joon Pyo! Let's go together. Have you seen this plane before?

292
1260
00:50:45,204 --> 00:50:48,414
Isn't it a beauty? 
 Yes! See this~

293
1265
00:50:48,414 --> 00:50:55,962
This is where the propeller is. 
 Later, you'll need to fly this.

294
1270
00:50:57,653 --> 00:51:02,780
This is the handle.

295
1274
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:08,109
Aren't there a lot of buttons? When you learn how to fly a plane, you must fly this one.

296
1278
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:14,535
Who are you? 
 I'm Goo Joon Pyo. 
 Joon Pyo is? 
 of course I am Dad's son!

297
1285
00:51:14,535 --> 00:51:18,885
What will you do when dad is not here?

298
1289
00:51:18,885 --> 00:51:24,027
I must take care of Mom, Sister and Shin Hwa Group!

299
1293
00:51:24,027 --> 00:51:25,783
Goo Joon  Pyo!

300
1297
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:28,606
Can you promise me, man to man?

301
1301
00:51:28,606 --> 00:51:30,483
Yes sir!

302
1305
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,187
I Promise!

303
1309
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,553
Hey!

304
1313
00:52:12,553 --> 00:52:15,401
Ji Hoo, Yoon Ji Hoo!

305
1317
00:52:21,383 --> 00:52:25,405
Min!
Ji Hoo!  What brings you here? When did you come?

306
1322
00:52:25,405 --> 00:52:28,017
Um, I came a few days ago. It's been a really long time.

307
1326
00:52:28,017 --> 00:52:31,492
Why didn't you tell me you were coming to Macau?

308
1330
00:52:31,492 --> 00:52:35,489
I missed you so much. 
 How long are you staying?

309
1335
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:38,179
We're about to go. 
You can't!

310
1340
00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:43,743
You can't. I can't let you go like this. 
 Ji Hoo, let's go to my house!

311
1345
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,439
I can't. I'm with company, so . . .

312
1349
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,580
Who . . . It can't be.

313
1353
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:55,217
She isn't Ji Hoo's girlfriend, is she?

314
1357
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,936
What if she says yes, will you stay?

315
1361
00:53:17,919 --> 00:53:22,363
I'm J iHoo's friend.  We went to the same school.

316
1365
00:53:22,363 --> 00:53:25,825
Oh, really.  Nice to meet you.

317
1369
00:53:27,197 --> 00:53:34,584
I'm really sick, right now.
It's very serious. So, grant me this one favor.

318
1374
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:35,997
Eh?

319
1378
00:53:35,997 --> 00:53:39,891
Let's go to my house. Just one day.

320
1382
00:53:39,891 --> 00:53:44,711
Uh?  Eh?  Well, Yeah . . .

321
1386
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,003
Let's go!

322
1390
00:53:57,363 --> 00:54:01,012
It's no big deal to leave one day later, right?

323
1394
00:54:11,296 --> 00:54:16,267
It's really been a long time, right?  Let's go!

324
1398
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:53,988
Oh, it looks delicious.  I cook so good, eh?

325
1402
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:58,323
You even know how to say things like that?

326
1406
00:54:58,323 --> 00:55:00,589
You speak Korean really well.

327
1410
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,026
Ji Hoo is Korean.

328
1414
00:55:05,263 --> 00:55:07,798
Did you learn Korean because of Ji Hoo sunbae?

329
1418
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,874
No!

330
1422
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:19,379
This is only for Ji Hoo's use.

331
1426
00:56:03,379 --> 00:56:07,575
Looks delicious.

332
1430
00:56:20,248 --> 00:56:23,222
Let's enjoy our meal.

333
1434
00:56:38,034 --> 00:56:39,862
Ji Hoo, eat up.

334
1438
00:57:02,788 --> 00:57:04,188
(Eat!)

335
1442
00:58:21,313 --> 00:58:24,326
That girl isn't pretty.

336
1446
00:58:25,842 --> 00:58:29,476
She's short, and she doesn't have any bosom,

337
1450
00:58:29,476 --> 00:58:33,834
And she eats way too much.

338
1454
00:58:33,834 --> 00:58:36,455
What do you want to hear?

339
1458
00:58:36,455 --> 00:58:40,835
That girl . . . Ji Hoo, she's your girlfriend?

340
1462
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:43,683
What do you think?

341
1466
00:58:43,683 --> 00:58:47,131
Ji Hoo, that girl,  you like her.

342
1470
00:58:47,131 --> 00:58:49,124
What?

343
1474
00:58:49,124 --> 00:58:53,505
Whenever you look at her, you smile.

344
1478
00:58:53,505 --> 00:58:55,255
Like before . . .

345
1482
00:58:55,255 --> 00:58:59,455
Before? 
Whenever you see Seo Hyun.  Like that.

346
1487
00:59:15,434 --> 00:59:18,608
Find out Geum JanDi's room number.

347
1491
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:26,933
What?

348
1495
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:32,558
She checked out? 

I got it.

349
1501
01:00:01,586 --> 01:00:04,636
Young master. It's time for us to leave.

350
1505
01:00:14,663 --> 01:00:17,776
When did Ji Hoo leave?

351
1509
01:00:17,776 --> 01:00:20,649
He is still in Macau.

352
1513
01:00:22,197 --> 01:00:25,935
Is that so? Didn't he check out?

353
1517
01:00:25,935 --> 01:00:29,705
He went with Geum Jan Di to his friend's house.

354
1521
01:00:29,705 --> 01:00:32,804
Friend? Which friend?

355
1525
01:00:32,804 --> 01:00:35,130
Should I find out?

356
1529
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,457
No. Forget it.
