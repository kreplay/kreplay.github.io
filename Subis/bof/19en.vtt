00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,320
Goo Joon Pyo!

2
7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,000
Hey you again!

3
11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,480
I told you there's a connection between us.

4
15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,680
I just knew that if I came by your house, I would be able to see you.

5
19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,400
Did you boil your cell phone or something?

6
23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,280
You are supposed to call and get permission from the owner before comming to visit someone's house.

7
27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,900
Don't you know that?

8
31
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,160
I'm tired.

9
35
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,140
Come to think of it, I don't remember learning anything like that.

10
39
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,200
Joon Pyo, how about you?

11
43
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,916
Hey, monkey!

12
47
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,760
Aren't you getting up?

13
51
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,120
Why are you lying on my bed?

14
55
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,760
Get up, hurry.

15
59
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,280
Get up, hurry!

16
63
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,720
Get up!

17
67
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,760
Get up!

18
71
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Do you want to make a bet with me?

19
75
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
What kind of bet?

20
79
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,120
Oh!  No, no, no!

21
83
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,080
Please win.

22
87
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,960
Please win!

23
91
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,040
I'll let you try again.

24
95
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Please win!

25
99
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,640
I won again!
How come you can never win?

26
104
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,600
I'm not playing this anymore!

27
108
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,320
Play it yourself. What is this???

28
112
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,560
Hey!

29
116
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,840
Stop drinking that.

30
120
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,680
It's going to hinder your recovery.

31
124
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,980
Recovery?

32
128
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,700
What does it matter if I don't get better soon?

33
132
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,060
So what if it's hindering me from making a few bowls?

34
136
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,220
I am probably going to continue living as a womanizer.

35
140
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,400
Aren't I?

36
144
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,000
Yi Jung, until now, you've been doing well. Why are you being like this?

37
148
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,360
Young master.

38
152
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,464
Your mother has again . . .

39
156
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:24,160
What happened?

40
160
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,720
She's doing okay at the hospital, but . . .

41
164
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,760
She is asking for you, young master.

42
168
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,920
Tell her I'm busy.

43
172
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,140
Where are you going?

44
176
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,080
If you don't want to see me go crazy,

45
180
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,720
Leave me alone.

46
184
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,600
Ga Eul.

47
188
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,480
You said you wanted to go on a date with me, right?

48
192
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,720
Is that offer still good?

49
196
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,280
If you want to walk away like this, then you shouldn't have asked me for a date.

50
200
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,920
The highlight  of the night has yet to come.

51
204
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,660
Did you say your name is Ga Eul?

52
208
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,640
Take your time and enjoy the food.

53
212
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,080
The foie gras (duck) here is the best.

54
216
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,400
Thank you.

55
220
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,900
It seems that you like Ga Eul.

56
224
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,840
Of course, how can I not like a cute young lady like Ga Eul?

57
228
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,800
I guess I'm just like you after all.

58
232
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,120
The mother is in the hospital, but the son is out on a date instead of being there.

59
236
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,300
You don't care if your wife is alive or dead,

60
240
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,920
but you dine on fois gras with a young lady.

61
244
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,520
I guess the apple really doesn't fall that far from the tree does it?

62
248
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,920
Let's talk about our family later.

63
252
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,000
Then what should we talk about?

64
256
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,060
You seem to take a liking to this lady, shall I lend her to you?

65
260
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,960
Yi Jung sunbae.

66
264
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,320
Why are you so formal and proper?

67
268
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,140
She's about the same age as your former girlfriend.

68
272
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,380
What do you think, Ga Eul?

69
276
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,160
Is my father okay for you?

70
280
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,800
Please, excuse me.

71
284
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,800
Today, you were the one who went overboard, my son.

72
288
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,440
Why are we here?

73
292
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,120
The loser needs to shut his mouth.  Did you forget the wager?

74
296
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,938
You agreed to be my servant today.

75
300
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:40,260
When did I?

76
304
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,820
Wow! What I really hate is someone who goes back on their word.

77
308
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,380
Have you heard a man's word is as good as blood?

78
312
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,040
A man's word is as good as a blond?

79
316
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,880
Don't talk, just follow me.

80
320
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,320
A man's word is as good as a blond?

81
324
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,840
Oh! Haha, that?

82
328
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,960
Why are you buying so much?

83
332
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,920
Hey! Hey! Hey!

84
336
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,840
Hey...

85
340
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,840
I am going to eat one.

86
344
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:52,660
I don't want to eat.

87
348
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,648
Just try once.

88
352
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,160
It's yummy, isn't it?

89
356
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,520
Your wife is really gorgeous.

90
360
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,000
You two look good together.

91
364
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,160
Thank you.

92
368
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Did you hear that? Did you hear that? He said I'm pretty.

93
372
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,680
You really buy that?

94
376
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:40,780
Thank you. 
 He's just trying to sell this thing we're eating.

95
381
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,300
It's not like that.  No!

96
385
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,400
No, he's not!

97
389
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,440
Thank you. 
 Hey!

98
394
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,980
Hey, monkey.  This is . . .

99
398
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,920
Jan Di moved to a new house.

100
402
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,480
She's living alone with her brother. I was concerned. So, I went to see her.

101
406
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,580
Here.

102
410
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,920
I've been on the receiving end of things again.

103
414
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,280
Today, I got something in return, too.

104
418
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:41,560
Would you like to come in and have a cup of tea?

105
422
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,160
At least, I can offer you warm green tea.

106
426
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,760
Ah, grandfather, ah,  h - he has already gone home.

107
430
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,680
Wait for a moment. I'll just prepare the tea.

108
434
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
<i>"Thank you, doctor grandpa."</i>

109
438
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:52,680
<i>Doctor grandfather, thank you.</i>

110
442
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,060
<i>Are you having fun, Ji Hoo?</i>

111
446
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,080
Yeah, grandpa!

112
450
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,680
Let's go fishing!

113
454
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,960
I'll catch a gigantic shark.

114
458
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,680
Fishing? Okay Ji Hoo, when should we go?

115
462
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,240
Right now.

116
466
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,840
Okay, let's go.

117
470
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,360
Wow, it smells so good.

118
474
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:36,340
Me first!!

119
478
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,840
How dare you? You're going to eat it all in the blink of an eye.

120
482
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,860
What?

121
486
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,080
Little bro, this girl is a glutton. Hurry up and eat.

122
490
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,200
That can't be, of course.  Whose money was used to buy all this?

123
494
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,340
Hey! That's it for you!

124
498
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,800
Hey! Hey!

125
502
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,320
Hey!

126
506
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,580
Why aren't you eating?

127
510
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,800
Because I'm tired of always only eat ramen.

128
514
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,280
What do you want to eat besides ramen?

129
518
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,720
Pizza!

130
522
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,040
I wouldn't have any other wishes if I could eat pizza the whole day.

131
526
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,520
What a small wish!

132
530
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,440
Ah! Don't eat!

133
534
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
You should eat something good.

134
538
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,600
Ah!  I'm so full.

135
542
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,840
By the way, why isn't Jan Di home yet?

136
546
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,440
Little brother, try calling.

137
550
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,180
Sister doesn't have a cellphone.

138
554
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,800
What?!  She doesn't have a cellphone anymore?

139
558
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,680
She gave it to my parents when they left, 
 for emergency.

140
563
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,160
You guys are really . . .

141
567
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,320
Oh, I see . . .

142
571
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,840
Let's go!

143
575
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,400
Where to?

144
579
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,280
What?

145
583
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,600
Come quick!

146
587
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,920
I will take this. 
 You mean this product?

147
592
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,220
Just a moment please.

148
596
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,480
It was this! This is what I told you!

149
600
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,140
Mister, please let me have a look at this.

150
604
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,520
Oh, that's what I want!

151
608
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,480
Oh, sorry. We came first.

152
612
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,660
Yo! CEO!

153
616
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,160
Guess you are not just CEO for show.
Good job, boy!

154
621
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,360
Excuse me, the one that I was talking about earlier on.

155
625
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,440
Ji Hoo.

156
629
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,040
Excuse me.

157
633
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,880
Ji Hoo!

158
637
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,800
I was wrong.

159
641
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,960
What are you talking about?  It was all my fault.

160
645
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,480
I killed your beloved son and daughter-in-law,

161
649
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,760
and survived alone.

162
653
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,720
You probably hated me.

163
657
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,160
It wasn't your fault.

164
661
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,460
It was my fault.

165
665
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,480
Ji Hoo!

166
669
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,980
15 years . . .

167
673
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,440
You should have said that 15 years ago.

168
677
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,840
Do you know?

169
681
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,680
That child . . .

170
685
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,480
How long . . .

171
689
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
That child waited for his grandfather?

172
693
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,540
Ji Hoo . . .

173
697
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,346
You didn't know, did you ?

174
701
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,140
That child . . .

175
705
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,520
Do you know how much that child longed to cry in his grandfather's arms?

176
709
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,160
My grandson. . .

177
713
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,420
Please never call me that again.

178
717
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,980
Ji Hoo!

179
721
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,560
Grandfather!

180
725
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,960
Grandfather, Grandfather!

181
729
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,440
I'm fine. Follow him. Hurry.

182
733
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,160
Go on.

183
737
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,880
Ji Hoo Sunbae!

184
741
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,600
Ji Hoo Sunbae!

185
745
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,520
Grandfather!

186
749
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,820
Grandfather!

187
753
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,060
Grandfather!

188
757
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,580
Grandfather!

189
761
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,840
Grandfather!

190
765
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,620
Because of me that kid may be crying.

191
769
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,280
I was scared.

192
773
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,980
Like father . . .

193
777
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,840
Like mother.

194
781
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,240
That kid may be crying because of me.

195
785
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,600
I ran away.

196
789
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,320
What kind of girl comes home at this hour?

197
793
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,080
Ah. That is . . .

198
797
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,700
Why am I explaining myself?
 It's not like I've done anything wrong.

199
802
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,240
It's my life! You don't even know the word "privacy"?

200
806
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,900
Hey, Geum Jan Di, if you want to say something, say it properly.

201
810
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,900
It is not privacy but p-r-i-d-e. Do you not even know what pride is?

202
814
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,000
What?

203
818
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,640
Hey, where are you going when someone is talking to you?

204
822
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,080
Whether it is privacy or pride,

205
826
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,520
I am going to school to find out. What do you want?!

206
830
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,600
Hey!

207
834
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,120
You really aren't going to tell me what you have been doing and where?

208
838
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,200
I won't!

209
842
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,120
Really!

210
846
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,280
Ah sheesh!

211
850
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,340
Is everything okay?

212
854
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,460
Yes.

213
858
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,800
What about Joon Pyo?

214
862
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,528
He went to school.

215
866
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:29,960
How are things with Joon Pyo and Jae Kyung?

216
870
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,220
When you were not around, she came often and spent time with young master.

217
874
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,060
Oh, did she?

218
878
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,020
That's a relief.

219
882
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,140
By the way . . .

220
886
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,620
Do you have anything else to report to me?

221
890
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,740
Yes?

222
894
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,580
Secretary Jang,

223
898
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,500
I know that you are busy supporting our family in my place.

224
902
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:04,460
But both you and I know that Joon Pyo is not the  type of person to give up easily.

225
906
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,140
It is too early to think that he has given up on her.

226
910
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,420
Don't you think?

227
914
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,920
I am sorry.

228
918
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:31,280
It is my mistake to miss something like this.

229
922
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,400
- Check it out right now. 
 Yes, President.

230
927
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,000
What a pain this must be for you!

231
931
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:14,200
Why don't you just return to your old neighborhood?

232
935
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:17,780
I told you it's training for getting used to an independent and wild lifestyle.

233
939
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:23,480
But you go back there for every meal with your chauffeur, 
you even go back there to change your clothes..

234
944
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,440
Which part of that is "wild and independent?"

235
948
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,580
Sleeping! I spend the nights here.

236
952
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,420
I spend nights here in this tiny room where I can't even stretch my long legs out
 with roaches and all kinds of bugs.

237
957
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,980
Who told you to do that?

238
961
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,620
No one asked you to do that.

239
965
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,059
Don't make your life so difficult!

240
969
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:42,400
Are you really not going to tell me?

241
973
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,040
What?!

242
977
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,500
I,  what . . .

243
981
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,320
I'm not asking because I'm curious about your pride,  or  privacy.

244
985
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,440
It is because I am like your guardian . . .

245
989
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,560
Hey! Ah sheesh!

246
993
00:33:56,311 --> 00:33:57,720
I'm not done talking to you.

247
997
00:34:01,436 --> 00:34:03,080
Hey!

248
1001
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,680
Are you Geum Kang  San?

249
1005
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,720
Yes, I am Geum Kang  San.

250
1009
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,680
Please come this way.

251
1013
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,280
<i>Kang San, cheer up ^^</i>

252
1017
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,240
<i>Enjoy it.</i>

253
1021
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,960
I granted your wish. Now eat as much as you want.

254
1025
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,920
Joon Pyo hyungnim?

255
1029
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,680
Is it good?

256
1033
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:12,480
Eat a lot.

257
1037
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,400
Kang San!

258
1041
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,000
- Let me have some too! 
- Me too!

259
1046
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,240
Welcome!

260
1050
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,800
Ji Hoo Sunbae.

261
1054
00:35:30,749 --> 00:35:32,280
What brings you here?

262
1058
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,560
I went to Jan Di's house and . . .

263
1062
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,600
Ah!  You still don't know.

264
1066
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,720
Jan  Di has already moved.

265
1070
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,560
She moved?

266
1074
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,640
You guys eat a lot, too.

267
1078
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:25,266
It bugs me even when he (Joon Pyo) is too quiet.

268
1082
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:43,300
Hey! Why aren't you turning on?

269
1086
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,520
Hey!

270
1090
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,240
Secretary Jang, it's me.

271
1094
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:00,320
I can't turn it on.

272
1098
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,820
What can it be! I'm talking about the stove! 
The stove!

273
1103
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,280
It doesn't turn on!

274
1107
00:37:09,848 --> 00:37:11,480
Come here quickly and do something about this!

275
1111
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,240
That was quick.

276
1115
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,340
Let go! Ah sheesh!

277
1119
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:53,020
Hey! I said let go!

278
1123
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,120
Get your hands off of me!

279
1127
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,740
Get your hands off of me!

280
1131
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,080
Hey, just let me go!

281
1135
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,160
Kang San.

282
1139
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,720
Hey!

283
1143
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,680
Who is it ?

284
1147
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,520
Hello! 
 Hey, yo!

285
1152
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:30,720
Sunbae!

286
1156
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,760
How did you guys find out?

287
1160
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,560
We heard you moved, so we're here for a housewarming party.

288
1164
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,920
The owner of the house has to invite you for there to be a housewarming party.

289
1168
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,400
But do the both of you really live is this kind of place?

290
1172
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,560
It's better than it looks.

291
1176
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,620
It is quiet and safe.

292
1180
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,120
The rent is quite cheap.

293
1184
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,200
Almost free!

294
1188
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,840
But,  Joon Pyo . . .

295
1192
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,940
Excuse me.

296
1196
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,740
Who can it be?

297
1200
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,280
Geum Jan  Di, you're pretty popular.

298
1204
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,300
Hold on a minute.

299
1208
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,740
Who is it?

300
1212
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,480
Who is it?

301
1216
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,220
How did they get here?

302
1220
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:06,580
I can hardly believe my eyes seeing you boys here at this late hour.

303
1224
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,240
Joon Pyo

304
1228
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,540
is not here.

305
1232
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,260
I know where my son is and what he is doing.

306
1236
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,460
What is the reason that you're here?

307
1240
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:23,800
Even a commoner like you, should know that it's etiquette to greet elders and ask them to come inside?

308
1244
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,420
So I am saying that family education is important.

309
1248
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,540
Then, would you like to come inside?

310
1252
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,280
Forget it.

311
1256
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,940
I prefer staying out here rather than stepping a foot inside.

312
1260
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,480
I knew you weren't an average girl, but I guess you excel in seducing men.                   .

313
1264
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,380
Chairwoman, it's not that but . . .

314
1268
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,420
If I'm wrong about this misunderstanding,

315
1272
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,220
Then please, tell me what your excuse is.

316
1276
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,460
I've done nothing wrong. I don't owe you an excuse.

317
1280
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:04,580
I find that hard to believe after you've been caught red handed after what had just happened.

318
1284
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,760
Is it not wrong to seduce someone who is engaged?

319
1288
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,500
Well, isn't it?

320
1292
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,540
I really have nothing to do with that.

321
1296
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,540
It was all Goo Joon Pyo's idea.

322
1300
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:28,260
Right, that's the typical excuse from girls like you,
 "I didn't do anything, he is the one who did it."

323
1305
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,920
That's why I am here for a favor.

324
1309
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,560
Even if my Joon Pyo comes to see you, please don't see him.

325
1313
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,580
Like you said, my Jun Pyo and you, Jan Di,

326
1317
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,700
are now two people who have nothing to do with each other.

327
1321
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,280
Can I believe that?

328
1325
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,820
Please make me believe that Jan  Di has pride.

329
1329
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,000
This is why,

330
1333
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,280
I will not allow you guys to hang out with Joon Pyo.

331
1337
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,540
Please think of my family and come to your senses!

332
1341
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,180
Lets go, Secretary Jung.

333
1345
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:15,780
Yes, Madam.

334
1349
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:23,860
Geum Jan Di,

335
1353
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,520
don't take Joon Pyo's mother's words to heart.

336
1357
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,600
She's normally like that.

337
1361
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,180
She's like that to us, too.

338
1365
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,620
But what is this talk about Joon Pyo?

339
1369
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,740
Ah . . .

340
1373
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,980
What is all this?

341
1377
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:19,180
Geum Jan Di, it's our gift for your new house!

342
1381
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,660
Eh?

343
1385
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,300
Ready!

344
1389
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,060
Go!

345
1393
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,340
The President said that you are grounded for a while.

346
1397
00:47:44,107 --> 00:47:45,780
I suggest that you should watch out for a while.

347
1401
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,580
How the hell did that witch find out?

348
1405
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,820
I wasn't cautious enough.

349
1409
00:47:50,455 --> 00:47:51,500
I'm sorry.

350
1413
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,060
Miss Jae Kyung is here.

351
1417
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,500
Why is that monster here again?

352
1421
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,700
Why did I come?

353
1425
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,600
What's so strange about a fiancee going to her fiance's house?

354
1429
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,380
I am not in the mood to amuse you.

355
1433
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,189
Just go.

356
1437
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:14,200
Really? I wanted to ask you along to Jan Di's house. I guess you can't then.

357
1441
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:16,460
Then I will go alone.

358
1445
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,220
Where did you say you were going?

359
1449
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:24,340
Jan Di's house. We had ramen at her place yesterday. I want to give this to her.

360
1453
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:32,120
I can go if you beg, but . . . 
 Really?

361
1458
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,680
But if the witch asks about it, say it's you.

362
1462
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,100
Don't worry about that.

363
1466
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,020
I already told her we're going on a date.

364
1470
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,340
Let's go!

365
1474
00:48:43,196 --> 00:48:44,400
Ah, it's troublesome!

366
1478
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,340
Let's go!

367
1482
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,260
Quick! 
 Wear your clothes, quick!

368
1487
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,860
Kang San, do you want more sausage?

369
1491
00:49:00,907 --> 00:49:03,100
He's sleeping.

370
1495
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:08,120
San, if you sleep like that you won't grow. Get up.

371
1499
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,540
San.

372
1503
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,820
Ah! I feel good.

373
1507
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,620
This kind of mood . . . It's been a long time . . .

374
1511
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,500
Isn't it like we are camping?

375
1515
00:49:24,714 --> 00:49:27,660
Since we're bored . . .

376
1519
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,940
Wait, you're not asking about a kiss, right?

377
1523
00:49:32,398 --> 00:49:34,420
You can do that in front of me, don't worry.

378
1527
00:49:35,546 --> 00:49:36,860
Shall we play a game?

379
1531
00:49:37,348 --> 00:49:38,180
Game?

380
1535
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:42,420
It's something that you have to do on a MT (bonding trip with coworkers or school friends).

381
1539
00:49:43,226 --> 00:49:44,300
What's that?

382
1543
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,940
Truth or dare.

383
1547
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,340
Truth or dare?

384
1551
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,420
Me too! Me too! Me too!

385
1555
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:09,700
You can ask a question to anyone you want.

386
1559
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,460
How do you know whether it is true or false?

387
1563
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,060
You can't lie.

388
1567
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,520
But there is a "no comment" option.

389
1571
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,700
"No comment" option?

390
1575
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:23,160
Let's say, if you don't want to answer the question, you can, as punishment . . .

391
1579
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,220
Give a kiss!

392
1583
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:27,720
Jae Kyung, why would you say something like that?

393
1587
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,180
Why not? It'll be fun!

394
1591
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,740
Fine, then you have to do a french kiss.

395
1595
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,140
No way!

396
1599
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,900
Ok, then, a kiss on the forehead?

397
1603
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,380
That should be fine, right?

398
1607
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:46,380
If not . . .  Getting hit?

399
1611
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,900
That's also great.

400
1615
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,780
Just . . .  kiss.

401
1619
00:51:07,627 --> 00:51:08,780
Me?

402
1623
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,760
Yoon Ji Hoo.

403
1627
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,540
Other than Seo Hyun, is there anyone else you thought you could love?

404
1631
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,380
For the first time in a long time, I have the desire to...

405
1635
00:51:41,456 --> 00:51:43,240
What?

406
1639
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,340
Hey! That wasn't even a hard one!

407
1643
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,200
Hey don't come over!

408
1647
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,780
Go away!

409
1651
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,900
Is it my turn?

410
1655
00:52:10,373 --> 00:52:11,260
Yes.

411
1659
00:52:18,863 --> 00:52:20,060
Joon Pyo,

412
1663
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:29,980
If the person you love is suffering because of you, 
would you let her go?

413
1668
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,900
No.

414
1672
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,100
I don't let go. I can't let go.

415
1676
00:52:49,844 --> 00:52:51,300
I would hold on tightly to her . . .

416
1680
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,100
and definitely make her happy.

417
1684
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:02,060
Now it's me, right?

418
1688
00:53:03,986 --> 00:53:05,060
Geum Jan Di.

419
1692
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:12,420
The promise we made last time, is it still valid?

420
1696
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:18,380
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

421
1700
00:53:18,576 --> 00:53:21,602
<i>you won't run away from me.</i>

422
1704
00:53:21,602 --> 00:53:23,980
<i>I promise.</i>

423
1708
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,720
<i>I'll promise  that</i>

424
1712
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:31,260
<i>whatever happens, your mother won't be the one to come between us.</i>

425
1716
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,060
No.

426
1720
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,180
The person who made that promise,

427
1724
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,540
and the person who held the promise . . .

428
1728
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,020
no longer exist.

429
1732
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,380
Now it's my turn, right?

430
1736
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,360
Woo Bin SunBae.

431
1740
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,300
Me?

432
1744
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,980
If the F4 were women,

433
1748
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,220
who would you want to get married to?

434
1752
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,980
What?

435
1756
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:26,920
I'm really curious.

436
1760
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,220
Who would it be?

437
1764
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,540
No way. None of them. I'd never want to!

438
1768
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,840
Self-centered,

439
1772
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,480
4th dimensional, 
(*meaning a person who is weird / in his own world)
 and a cold hearted womanizer.

440
1778
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,420
Would you want me to spend my whole life with someone like that?

441
1782
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,740
I'd rather be sent to a nunnery.

442
1786
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:41,780
What's wrong?

443
1790
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,880
Self-centered egoist?

444
1794
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,900
4th-dimensional?

445
1798
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,780
Cold-hearted Casanova?

446
1802
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,480
Hey! hey!

447
1806
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,300
What would you do if you didn't have a choice but to choose one of us, huh?

448
1810
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,740
That's all, right? 
 I'm leaving.

449
1815
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,840
Hold on.

450
1819
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,820
What now?

451
1823
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,380
I want to play it, too.

452
1827
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,520
What?

453
1831
00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:41,720
That truth or dare game.

454
1835
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,892
I am going to ask just one question. Will you answer me?

455
1839
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,000
That game ended a while ago.

456
1843
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:53,560
Love and friendship.

457
1847
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:01,080
What would you choose if you had to choose one out of them?

458
1851
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,880
Both.

459
1855
00:56:10,888 --> 00:56:12,640
There is no such thing as "giving up" in my dictionary.

460
1859
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,440
Go in and sleep.

461
1863
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,880
Fool.

462
1867
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,680
If you keep saying all the right things,

463
1871
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,000
what am I supposed to do?

464
1875
00:56:57,883 --> 00:57:01,120
Noona, the ground's shaking.

465
1879
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,280
I'm shaking too.

466
1883
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,480
Is it an earthquake?

467
1887
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,680
Where do you think we are, Japan?

468
1891
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,160
EARTHQUAKE?!

469
1895
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,080
Oh, you guys are still here.
Hurry, pack your belongings and leave.

470
1900
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,560
This morning, we've started to demolish this building.

471
1904
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,640
Demolish?

472
1908
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,000
All of a sudden?

473
1912
00:57:58,256 --> 00:58:01,180
We're just following orders. We don't have any of the details.

474
1916
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,960
So please pack your belongings.

475
1920
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,540
We must do as ordered.

476
1924
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,460
Who ordered?

477
1928
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,820
We don't have that information.

478
1932
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,500
Please hurry and pack your belongings.

479
1936
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,600
<i>You draw an engaged man to your house, and what?</i>

480
1940
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,040
<i>You say you've done nothing wrong?</i>

481
1944
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,840
Noona, what do we do now?

482
1948
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,000
It's ok. Don't worry.

483
1952
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:07,680
<i>It seems that father is mesmerized by this young lady, should I lend her to you?</i>

484
1956
00:59:08,464 --> 00:59:09,680
<i>Yi Jung sunbae.</i>

485
1960
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,400
Well done. See you tomorrow.

486
1964
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,420
You're working  diligently.

487
1968
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,720
It's because I want to make something decent already.

488
1972
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,680
Well then, I will leave first.

489
1976
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,240
Goodbye.

490
1980
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,360
What is that?

491
1984
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,128
It's very unique.

492
1988
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,240
I made it when I was little.

493
1992
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,200
It even has some writing.

494
1996
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,720
It's pretty.

495
2000
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,211
Do you like it?

496
2004
01:00:18,211 --> 01:00:19,579
Yes.

497
2008
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:22,440
Teacher, can you lend this to me for a few days?

498
2012
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,240
I've wanted to make something like this.

499
2016
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,600
It's not hard. Would you like to try making one?

500
2020
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,280
It is something very valuable to me, so return it to me in one piece.

501
2024
01:00:32,801 --> 01:00:33,920
Yes.

502
2028
01:00:42,135 --> 01:00:43,367
It's pretty!

503
2032
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:45,200
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

504
2037
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,920
Take care.

505
2041
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:10,040
You've put too much pressure on your wrist.

506
2045
01:01:12,115 --> 01:01:13,600
Yi Jung sunbae.

507
2049
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,280
Noona, are you jealous?

508
2053
01:01:36,723 --> 01:01:41,440
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to eat a whole bunch of seafood.

509
2057
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,240
So cheap.

510
2061
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:48,240
You get to eat lots of delicious seafood all by yourself and get to sleep with mom and dad.

511
2065
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,520
Lucky.

512
2069
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,480
Maybe I should I go too.

513
2073
01:01:52,836 --> 01:01:54,280
No way!

514
2077
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,400
Didn't you say you were going to Shin Hwa Medical School after you graduate from Shin Hwa High School.

515
2081
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,280
How do you plan on doing that if you go?

516
2085
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,840
Do you really think you'll be okay?

517
2089
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,280
Don't worry.

518
2093
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,280
I'll take good care of mom and dad.

519
2097
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,180
I'm going.

520
2101
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,640
Noona,

521
2105
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:29,000
Don't just drink milk for breakfast. Eat some food too.

522
2109
01:02:31,227 --> 01:02:32,240
Food.

523
2113
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,640
It seems like Joon Pyo Hyungnim still likes you.

524
2117
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,200
I said he still likes you.

525
2121
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:57,088
I'm always on your side sister. Be strong! Fighting!

526
2125
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,200
Geum Jan Di.

527
2129
01:03:53,591 --> 01:03:54,375
Geum Jan Di.

528
2133
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,440
I really have to get going.

529
2137
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,317
What did he say?

530
2141
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,720
Can't I eat a little?
