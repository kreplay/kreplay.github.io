1
3
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:47,224
A true gentleman would never leave such a beautiful lady by herself..

2
7
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:53,840
This is a dream, right? I feel like I'm floating.

3
11
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,431
It would be nice if she got off of my shoes...

4
15
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:15,781
She looks like a completely different person.

5
19
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:18,383
Definitely Min Seo Hyun's work.

6
23
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:23,256
Maybe I should bring her to my next exhibition as my partner.

7
27
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:51,975
What the...

8
31
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:58,818
WAHHH!!!

9
35
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:12,698
Save me!!!

10
39
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:25,912
He fell! Senior Goo Joon Pyo fell into the pool!
Come quickly!

11
44
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:37,657
What is it? Why is it such a big deal ?

12
48
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:38,757
He can't.

13
52
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:39,725
Eh?

14
56
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:43,296
The only thing the GREAT Goo Joon Pyo cannot do is swim!

15
60
00:05:54,165 --> 00:06:14,794
Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo!
 Wake up! Open your eyes! Hey!

16
65
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:48,490
What the..

17
69
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:54,033
You're such scum.

18
73
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:44,780
You swindling bastard!

19
77
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,486
Achoo!!

20
81
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:52,657
Master, I'm sorry! 
I'll prepare the tea again!
 Please forgive me!

21
87
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:55,627
For what?

22
91
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:59,932
Have you caught a cold?
 Shall I call Doctor Kim?

23
96
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:08,273
What cold? I feel great.
Prepare the car, I should go to school soon.

24
101
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:10,610
You want to leave this early sir?

25
105
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:20,884
It's never too early for a student going to school. 
 Don't you know that bugs that wake up early die early?

26
110
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:23,721
I'll fire the maid immediately.

27
114
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,390
But why?

28
118
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,591
Pardon?

29
122
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:41,974
Butler Lee, don't you think you are too uptight? Relax. Relax.

30
126
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:48,981
Ahhh, what wonderful weather!

31
130
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:32,191
What the.. Goo Joon Pyo!

32
134
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:43,635
Wait until I get my hands on you! 
If you get caught, you're done for.

33
139
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:47,673
Getting here so early just to work on that.

34
143
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:52,176
This is the first time I've seen him try this hard.

35
147
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:56,349
Problem is, why must he torture the poor transfer student?

36
151
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:59,485
Furthermore, if you think about it,
isn't she the one who saved his life?

37
156
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:02,855
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
This is a situation you use it in, isn't that right?

38
161
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:06,764
What are you guys talking about? 
This is my way of saying thanks for yesterday.

39
166
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:11,697
If not, why would I bother to do such
silly things to a low class person.

40
171
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:15,735
Normal people may not be grateful for this.

41
175
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:19,539
Ji Hoo isn't here. So now you are
picking on me instead, huh?

42
180
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:21,941
Right, why isn't that guy here, anyway?

43
184
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:25,578
After he came back from Hainan Island,
he slipped into depression.

44
189
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:30,249
Lovers quarrel huh?

45
193
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:37,123
Idiot! If you like a girl,  just grab her. 
 What's so hard about that?

46
198
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,164
I'll just leave after I do this...

47
202
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:28,147
First, it was Senior Joon Pyo and now, Senior Ji Hoo? 
Does she have a death wish or something?

48
207
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,483
Oh, my god! Look at that fox!

49
211
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:38,491
Naturally, that girl is the type that
doesn't know when to back off. 
What the heck are we supposed to do now?

50
217
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,315
(Geum Jan Di's â™¥)

51
221
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:04,683
Hey! Don't you think you're arriving kind of late?
Could you even be on a swim team?
 You'd be forced off for sure.

52
227
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:09,247
Could you even be on a swim team?

53
231
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:11,284
You'd be kicked out for sure..

54
235
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:47,134
I think they've been meeting up for a while.

55
239
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:51,524
There's a reason senior Ji Hoo is so protective of Jan Di .

56
243
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:55,494
As time passes, friendships are even
 being affected because of this girl.

57
248
00:14:55,494 --> 00:15:01,167
So now you know that even though Jan Di looks innocent,
her actions are those of a flower snake.

58
253
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,543
Shut up!!

59
257
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,908
If you say one more word, I will twist your neck.

60
261
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,390
That was brand new...

61
265
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:24,016
Disappointed the one you were 
really hoping to see isn't here?

62
270
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,352
Goo Joon Pyo! 
Why are you ....

63
275
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:30,693
What?
Am I not allowed to come here?

64
280
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:34,759
Did you two rent this place out or something?

65
284
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:39,232
Where are you going?

66
288
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,734
Since I have nothing to say to you I'm going home. 
Do you have a problem with that?

67
293
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:42,769
I do.

68
297
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:43,669
What the heck are you doing?!

69
301
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,157
I have something to say!

70
305
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:46,657
Let go.. and talk.

71
309
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:51,410
Who do you think you are to fool with me? 
 To mess with us, the great F4 ?

72
314
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,379
Who fooled whom?

73
318
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,747
Let go!!

74
322
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:03,989
Was I a joke? Just because I went easy on someone like you?

75
326
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:11,129
I don't know if you know this about me,
but I'm not a charitable person.

76
331
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:15,968
It's dissatisfying having to give more than I can take.

77
335
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:21,541
What the heck are you doing?

78
339
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:35,054
No!  Stop!
No!

79
344
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,168
Do you hate me that much?


80
349
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,808
Geum Jan Di, are you going to school or not?

81
353
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:30,746
I'm not going!

82
357
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:32,044
Would you like to get hit and go? Or just go?

83
361
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,779
Just hit me and I won't go. Hit me!

84
365
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,915
Huh! You, really!

85
369
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,225
Would you like to get hit and go?  Or just go? 
 I want to get hit and not go. 
 Hit me!  I'm not going! I can't go!

86
375
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:40,319
I'd rather break the ice of the Han river and swim there.

87
379
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,754
I'm not going back that school! Never!

88
383
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,791
Do you want me to die?
I'll never go back!

89
388
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,426
Isn't today PlaySat?(nol toh= short for "playing Saturday")

90
392
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,270
And also, some man delivered this for you.

91
396
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,167
What is that?

92
400
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,370
What's that?

93
404
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,607
Invitation. Hello. I want to invite all of you to my home to celebrate my 23rd birthday.  
 Please free up your schedule so you can attend.. Min Seo Hyun

94
409
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,041
Pa... Party!!

95
413
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:09,252
Party? Then, is our Jan Di finally
making her debut in society?

96
418
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:14,022
Oh, honey! 
Honey, honey, honey...

97
423
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:16,554
Give me the card. Give it to me!

98
427
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:21,361
It's not time for us to be doing this right now.
Dress, honey dress, dress

99
432
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,161
Dress!

100
436
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,162
Take this one here.

101
440
00:19:53,158 --> 00:20:00,320
I'm sorry, Jan Di.  I can't even give my daughter a nice evening dress.

102
444
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,903
I'm sorry, Jan Di.  Since our neighborhood is poor, they don't bring in decent clothes to be serviced here either!

103
448
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:09,347
Ah! There's a hanbok.
How this? Will it do?

104
453
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:12,111
Is she going to a traditional wedding?

105
457
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,979
They said garden party, PARTY!

106
461
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:22,320
Isn't this the part where the charming prince
comes and takes the girl shopping for a dress?

107
466
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,760
Hello. This is a gift from Ms. Min Seo Hyun.

108
470
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,662
Min Seo Hyun?!

109
474
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,673
Let's see, let's see.

110
478
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:41,677
Does it fit?

111
482
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:43,042
A little bit lower.

112
486
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,701
Why didn't you call last time?

113
490
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:06,198
You said you were going to call me, but you never did.

114
494
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,334
Wait a minute, you said the same thing to me too!

115
498
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,437
Who did you come with tonight?

116
502
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,560
I don't think you're with someone.
What do you think about me??

117
507
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,775
What are you talking about? It's me that he wants!

118
511
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,811
Ya! Don't touch him. You're funny!

119
515
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,780
Hold on, hold on, sorry!

120
519
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,923
Hey, darling, why are you so late?

121
523
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:34,960
What brings you here?

122
527
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,100
Seo Hyun unnie invited me here, why?

123
531
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,134
Did you empty the departmental store ?

124
535
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:48,107
I thought this last time too, but doesn't Geum Jan Di
look pretty good when she's all dressed up?

125
540
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:52,411
Right. You're the cutest one here.

126
544
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:57,215
Cute??! Can you transform a  pumpkin into a
watermelon just by drawing some lines on it?

127
549
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:02,688
- Huh! Goo Joon Pyo
- has a point.

128
554
00:22:53,186 --> 00:23:09,274
Happy Birthday to you. Dear Min Seo Hyun~
Happy Birthday to you~

129
559
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:33,093
Thank you all for coming here to celebrate my 23rd birthday

130
563
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:41,611
I would like to thank my family and
friends for their love and care.

131
568
00:23:41,611 --> 00:23:51,144
I also have something else to announce to all of you. That was why I held this huge party, which is not like me.

132
572
00:23:51,144 --> 00:23:57,083
Where'd that punk Ji Hoo go?
 They're not gonna announce  their engagement, are they?

133
577
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:01,487
I'm going back to Paris next week

134
581
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:06,129
and I won't be returning to Korea.

135
585
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:10,163
I've already packed and arranged
everything and folded model activities.

136
590
00:24:10,163 --> 00:24:11,931
What's she talking about?

137
594
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:26,645
I do not wish to rely on the fruits of my parents' labor.
 Instead, I would like to start fresh relying only on my own abilities.

138
599
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:30,916
I will not be taking over my parent's law firm.

139
603
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:38,825
Because I want a life where I can
travel the world and give back as much as I can.

140
608
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:49,102
My decision is bound to cause an uproar since it will be hard for those of you with differing views to understand.

141
612
00:24:51,672 --> 00:24:59,681
Everyone...Please be happy for me.

142
616
00:25:13,123 --> 00:25:17,463
Min Seo Hyun... She's always full of surprises!

143
620
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:22,101
Ji Hoo.. Did he know about this the whole time?

144
624
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:25,172
Now we know the reason why he's been so depressed.

145
628
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:30,877
It's impressive, but what's Ji Hoo going to do?

146
632
00:25:47,594 --> 00:25:49,763
Hi.

147
636
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,735
I can't believe you still have this.

148
640
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,351
It's from the first time we were separated.

149
644
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:05,295
You remember, huh?

150
648
00:26:08,147 --> 00:26:14,421
It's since then that you stopped calling me noona.

151
652
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:16,223
What was I to you?

152
656
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:27,334
Our Ji Hoo must be very mad.

153
660
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:33,606
I also feel like I'm being thrown away.

154
664
00:26:33,606 --> 00:26:39,779
If there is something here that can't be so easily thrown away...it's... you.

155
668
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:43,116
Don't lie!

156
672
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:48,188
If it was a lie, then it wouldn't have bothered
me that you're interested in someone else.

157
677
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:52,025
What are you talking about?

158
681
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:58,865
When you dashed towards that girl,
I don't know why but my heart sank.

159
686
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:00,333
Funny, right?

160
690
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:04,237
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

161
694
00:27:06,105 --> 00:27:14,347
But isn't it great?
 Our Ji Hoo has really become a man.

162
699
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:16,049
Don't joke around!

163
703
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,456
You'll do what you want anyway.

164
707
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:29,629
But you'll tighten me today and loosen me up tomorrow so I can neither go to you nor distance myself from you.  I was just a toy.

165
711
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:35,135
If I lost you I would not be able to sleep.

166
715
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:39,639
Who's interested in whom?

167
719
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:43,242
Only looking at Min Seo Hyun for
15 years, it's not enough!

168
724
00:27:43,242 --> 00:27:45,087
I'm a man, too!

169
728
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:49,282
A man who's eager to embrace a
woman called Min Seo Hyun!

170
733
00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:08,236
I know, me too. Sorry, Ji Hoo.
I'm really sorry.

171
738
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:06,397
It would be really embarrassing if you passed out there.

172
742
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:11,296
Such behavior really doesn't suit you.
You know that, right?

173
747
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:14,836
Who says I was going to faint?

174
751
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:28,247
Oh,  Jan Di, you came...
 but why didn't you come in?

175
756
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:33,820
Ah...  that... uh...  that's because...

176
760
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:40,760
I was about to come to greet you and
say thank you. I came by... just now.

177
765
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,595
The party was chaotic, yes?

178
769
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:47,067
We were thinking of going on a quiet drive together.
Would you like to come with us then?

179
774
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:51,971
Eh? Oh, no.. it's ok.

180
778
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:55,474
We have somewhere else to go.

181
782
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:57,209
We?

182
786
00:29:57,209 --> 00:30:02,415
Yes, both of us were also going to go for a drive.

183
790
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:08,755
Drive!  We're going to . . . 
Then, goodbye.

184
795
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:15,026
- See you later.Let's go.
- Unni.

185
800
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:27,907
I've paid my debt.

186
804
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:28,941
What debt?

187
808
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:30,610
Saving me at the pool.

188
812
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,881
You want to repay me for saving your life just like that?

189
816
00:30:35,715 --> 00:30:37,182
Then shall we go back?

190
820
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:38,951
10%

191
824
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:41,154
let's say it's even..

192
828
00:30:41,154 --> 00:30:42,755
50

193
832
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:44,023
25

194
836
00:30:56,936 --> 00:31:02,006
This is nice.

195
840
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:05,511
But why aren't there any customers?

196
844
00:31:05,511 --> 00:31:09,880
I sent them out.

197
848
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,783
Why?

198
852
00:31:10,783 --> 00:31:15,320
I rented it out til the morning,
so do whatever you want.

199
857
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,619
Do whatever I want, what?

200
861
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:25,929
Yell or cry.  If you want to hit someone, do you
want me to call a Mr. portly on standby outside?

201
866
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:29,134
Why do I have to do that?

202
870
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:34,472
DIdn't you have a heart attack after
seeing Ji Hoo and Seo Hyun?

203
875
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:37,143
What? No way!

204
879
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:42,881
Someone like me can't compete with Min Seo Hyun, right.?

205
883
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:49,856
I'm not pretty, 
not smart either.
And I come from a poor family.

206
889
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:54,926
And your figure is mediocre and your character sucks too.

207
893
00:31:54,926 --> 00:32:02,838
THAT'S RIGHT!  How could a girl like me
dare to be jealous of Min Seo Hyun?

208
898
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,871
I didn't have a chance against her from the beginning.

209
902
00:32:05,871 --> 00:32:10,310
Even though there's lots of bad things about you,
 there are still some good things.

210
907
00:32:15,948 --> 00:32:17,850
You have potential.

211
911
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,421
Huh?

212
915
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:32,999
I'm certain if Ji Hoo had met you first, he would have fallen for you.

213
919
00:32:35,668 --> 00:32:38,170
Seriously?

214
923
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:48,881
Looks, brains, and background may not be much,
but you're the first girl I've approved of.

215
928
00:32:48,881 --> 00:32:50,749
Full of potential.

216
932
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,448
Hang on, I need to go use the restroom.

217
936
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:25,904
It's warm.  Isn't it warm? It's warm, I'm thirsty.  Water.

218
940
00:33:53,763 --> 00:33:57,135
Man, what the heck?

219
944
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,046
Hey, Dry Cleaner!

220
948
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,118
Hey,  wake up!

221
952
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:16,821
What's wrong with her?

222
956
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,025
Well, it's because of that.

223
960
00:34:26,229 --> 00:34:27,599
She drank all of it?

224
964
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,299
Yes.

225
968
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:37,641
Hey.  Hey!  Wake up, woman!

226
972
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:47,050
Woman?  Yeah, I'm a woman.  
What?   Can't commoners be women too?

227
977
00:34:47,050 --> 00:35:04,502
I know that my family background, my physical appearance and my brains are all crap.  Even without you pointing that out, I feel it in my bones every day, you bastard!

228
981
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,839
What?  Bastard?

229
985
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:27,823
No, no.  I don't have time to waste on things like this.  
If you only knew how busy I am.

230
990
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:57,320
I have to be a loser at an exclusive school where it's not fate, do part-time jobs because of a Dad who causes so much trouble.  And for tuition, I have to swim so I can get a scholarship. 
 I don't have time to butt into you princes' love lives!

231
995
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:04,929
You alcoholic 
Hey, gangster!  
Wake up!  Ya!

232
1001
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:19,577
I'm so sad lately.  
I'm a bit sad.

233
1006
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:28,024
You bastard!  Goo Joon Pyo!!  You're the enemy!

234
1010
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:38,563
Fine, I'll let this go because I feel like it.  50%!

235
1014
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:43,537
I'm saying that I'll cut in half what you owe to your savior!!

236
1018
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:50,241
Thank you Goo Joon Pyo, for saving me today.

237
1022
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:58,983
I don't really have anything I can do for you, instead, I will . . . .

238
1026
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:31,016
Aisshh!

239
1030
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,430
"Charity Auction in aid of Namibian Refugees""

240
1034
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,748
I just know this is a really expensive room just by smelling it.

241
1038
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,519
You have a really good sense of smell. (geh koh: euphemism short for "you have a nose like a dog")

242
1042
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:19,998
What happened? 
Why am I here?

243
1047
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:25,770
You're here because I brought you here. 
 That's what I'm saying! Why am I here and not my house!

244
1052
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,306
You don't remember?

245
1056
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:52,464
This suit just came from Milan two days ago, and was designed by the famous designer, Yoshikuchi Kenzi, of Ermenegildo Zegna as one of his new works for this spring/summer collection.

246
1060
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:53,498
The price is . . .

247
1064
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,401
Hey, stop.  There's no reason to shock her.

248
1068
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:08,178
I'm not exactly in the mood to listen to you brag about your clothes right now in this kind of situation!

249
1072
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:09,580
That's what I wore yesterday.

250
1076
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,251
What's that got to do with me?!

251
1080
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:18,990
It was the first time I wore that suit, and my last, thanks to someone.

252
1084
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,696
Do you remember now?

253
1088
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,585
Then, in that state, we needed to come to my house.  Or should we have gone to yours?

254
1092
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,920
Sorry.

255
1096
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,461
I already notified your parents.
 According to the driver, they didn't seem that concerned.

256
1101
00:40:02,565 --> 00:40:08,506
I'll leave now.  I'm sorry for all the trouble I may have caused you.

257
1105
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,675
Just do what you normally do.

258
1109
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,915
Young master.

259
1113
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,016
What's the matter?

260
1117
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:18,916
The lady of the house . . .

261
1121
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,151
What about the witch?

262
1125
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:22,754
She has arrived.

263
1129
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,989
Already?

264
1133
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:28,393
Why is she here already?

265
1137
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,733
What about  Joon Pyo?

266
1141
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:36,767
He is on the second floor.

267
1145
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,905
I'm going to have him take part in the event, so put someone on him to make sure he doesn't run off somewhere.

268
1149
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,607
Yes, ma'am.

269
1153
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:50,782
What?

270
1157
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,235
It's an emergency!

271
1161
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:01,171
YJH: What?  
GJP: The witch showed up here.

272
1166
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:04,541
Jan Di is in my room right now, but I can't get her out!

273
1170
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:07,944
Joon Pyo, if you get caught, then . .

274
1174
00:41:07,944 --> 00:41:09,512
You're dead meat!

275
1178
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:30,133
She finds an unfamiliar girl in her son's room, especially someone with Geum Jan Di's profile.

276
1182
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:31,334
I'm really curious.

277
1186
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:38,341
I'll bet $1,000 that she'll send Joon Pyo to Alaska tomorrow morning...

278
1190
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:42,946
I'll bet $3,000 that she'll send him to Sejong Antarctic Research Center.


279
1195
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:46,716
Rather than that, she'll probably hire an assassin first.

280
1199
00:41:46,716 --> 00:41:53,055
What?  
Really? 
 Is she really that scary?

281
1205
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:57,896
Do you remember the day we ran away from 6th grade camp?

282
1209
00:41:57,896 --> 00:42:02,098
We almost died.  How can I forget?

283
1213
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:36,232
Don't move!

284
1217
00:43:20,242 --> 00:43:21,811
Bonjour!

285
1221
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:23,379
Noona!

286
1225
00:43:25,115 --> 00:43:26,818
Is this really So Yi Jong?

287
1229
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:28,933
Can you really look this cool?

288
1233
00:43:28,933 --> 00:43:31,755
Noona is the very one whom people call a Korean Vivienne Westwood.

289
1237
00:43:31,755 --> 00:43:33,289
What is it? Hurry up and tell me,

290
1241
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:34,624
Hm?

291
1245
00:43:34,624 --> 00:43:37,592
What is it you want?

292
1249
00:43:37,592 --> 00:43:40,996
After all, this is why I like noona so much.

293
1253
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:44,385
A request to sponsor needy schoolchildren has come in from Seoul City..

294
1257
00:43:45,853 --> 00:43:47,254
Reject.

295
1261
00:43:47,254 --> 00:43:51,758
The Ministry of Education would like to conduct a special selection process for agriculture students at Shin Hwa University from next year onwards....

296
1265
00:43:51,758 --> 00:43:52,526
Reject.

297
1269
00:43:55,762 --> 00:43:57,632
You've held up Joon Pyo well, right?

298
1273
00:43:57,632 --> 00:43:58,698
Yes.

299
1277
00:44:41,908 --> 00:44:43,276
Hello.

300
1281
00:44:54,753 --> 00:44:56,190
Who is she?

301
1285
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,928
Ah!  Hello.

302
1289
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,900
She's my guest, so don't worry about it.

303
1293
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,640
She's in my house, so she's my guest as well.  Isn't that right, young lady?

304
1297
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,040
She's a friend.

305
1301
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:12,444
Friend?

306
1305
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:20,985
Yes, she's our junior at our school.  She's a cute sophomore, so we're specifically training her as the F4 mascot.  Something like that..

307
1309
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:23,288
Whose daughter are you?

308
1313
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,891
I'm the . .

309
1317
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:29,626
What does your father do?

310
1321
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:30,562
My father -

311
1325
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:32,464
has a business.

312
1329
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:37,935
Really? 
What kind?

313
1334
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:44,475
He's in the clothing business.  No, I mean, fashion business.  It's actually pretty famous within the industry.

314
1338
00:45:46,478 --> 00:45:51,216
That's interesting.  So, do you have any interest in today's auction?

315
1342
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:58,624
Yes, she has more than an interest.  With the new dress from Bella, she's the darkhorse who will definitely raise a lot of donations tonight..

316
1346
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:05,663
I guess your mother has a very discerning eye.

317
1350
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:07,466
What does your mother do?

318
1354
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:13,571
President, it's time for you to greet your guests.

319
1358
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,375
Joon Pyo, come downstairs and take your place.

320
1362
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:23,114
The rest of you, since it's for a good cause, do your part before you leave.

321
1366
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,849
Yes ma'am...

322
1370
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:42,601
Why did you lie? 
 How are you going to fix this?

323
1375
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:47,071
We should have told the truth.

324
1379
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:51,676
Then, should we tell the truth that your dad owns a dry cleaner and your mom, a sauna?

325
1383
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:56,481
If we did that, then no one knows what would've happened to not only you, but to your family as well.

326
1387
00:46:56,481 --> 00:47:01,552
It's not a joke when we say that you won't survive once you've been singled out.

327
1391
00:47:04,924 --> 00:47:09,693
So it's genetic, huh?

328
1395
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:32,116
Yes, this next auction item, once you see it, I bet your eyes will jump! 
 It's coming out now, please look closely. It's Swimmer Pak Taehwan's goggles!

329
1400
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:35,053
Pak Tae Hwan's goggles? 
 (Olympic swimmer from Korea)

330
1405
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:53,004
We're starting at 500,000 won.

1420
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:05,883
$7,000.  Do I hear $7,500?

334
1424
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:14,424
$8,000.  Ah, I see $8,000.  Do I hear $8,500?

335
1428
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:17,195
Yes, $8,500.

336
1432
00:48:19,031 --> 00:48:28,139

337
1436
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:39,049
Are there no further bids?
 If there are none, we will go onto the count. One. Two. Three!

338
1441
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,953
Sold for $10,000!

339
1445
00:48:46,458 --> 00:49:01,673
This next auction item.  Please look carefully, it's coming out right now. 
 It's the newest item from the young sculptor, So Yi Jung.  It's a vase.  We will start bidding at 5,000,000 won.

340
1450
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:34,071
The next auctioned item is the suit of Shin Hwa Group's Mr. Goo Joon Pyo.

341
1454
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:38,110
The greatest aspect of the suit is that the person wearing it cannot tell whether he is wearing it or not!

342
1458
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:41,078
We are starting at $10,000.

343
1462
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:46,417
Yes we have $10,000! 
 Do we have $15,000?

344
1467
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,653
Yes we have $15,000!

1471

<i>[Auctioneer speaking]</i>

346
1475
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:00,498
Do we have $20,000? Yes, we have $20,000!

347
1479
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,968
Wow, we are getting tremendous response!!

348
1483
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:12,107
[auctioneer speaking]

349
1487
00:50:12,107 --> 00:50:19,017
Is there $25,000.. Oh! $25,000! Wow! Great!

350
1491
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:21,386

351
1495
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:23,655
What are you doing? Hurry up, it's your turn now!

352
1499
00:50:23,655 --> 00:50:35,700
[auctioneer speaking]

353
1503
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,903
Yes the next auction item, it's very dazzling

354
1507
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:40,172
I can't do that! Please! Please!

355
1511
00:50:40,172 --> 00:50:40,872
You can do it!

356
1515
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,908
I can't! I can't!

357
1519
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:20,078
Yes, the light yellow tint, and the lemon-like color will uplift the wearer's glamour..

358
1523
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:25,883
The gold spangles and beads stress the luxury of the item.

359
1527
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:31,255
We are starting the bid for this Bella Song dress at $10,000.

360
1531
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:38,395
Yes, we have $10,000! 
Do we have higher bids? $15,000?

361
1536
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:41,498
How is Joon Pyo  doing these days?

362
1540
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,868
He has been very quiet.

363
1544
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:48,338
He is even attending school well.

364
1548
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:52,277
Do you know that student?

365
1552
00:51:56,081 --> 00:52:00,986
It's a pleasure to finally meet the famous Wonder Girl.

366
1556
00:52:00,986 --> 00:52:06,390
I didn't push him.  Really, I -

367
1560
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,025
Mr. Jung.

368
1564
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:08,927
Yes?

369
1568
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:13,998
I know that she is a student of Shin Hwa High School.

370
1572
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,673
Find out whose daughter she is.  
Yes, madam.

371
1577
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:39,857
Is this real?  Are these really the goggles that Pak Tae Hwan used?

372
1581
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:41,258
Mmm.

373
1585
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:50,568
WAHHH!  Noona, noona, big news!

374
1589
00:52:50,568 --> 00:52:51,869
Now what?

375
1593
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:56,774
Pak Tae Hwan's goggles! If you sell them, you can get at least $2,000!

376
1597
00:52:56,774 --> 00:53:04,581
$2,000?! $2,000 for goggles?
 Sell them! We have to sell them. Where can you find $2,000?

377
1602
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:07,184
No way!!  It's worth so much more.

378
1606
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:20,331
What I'm saying is, this is one of those things that you can't put a price on.

379
1610
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:28,972
Sell it. $2,000 is $2,000. I would understand if it were just $20. What's wrong with you?

380
1614
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:34,448
But still, if we sell them . . . It's kind of . .

381
1618
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:37,214
Ah . . .  I don't know.

382
1622
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,551
Good night.

383
1626
00:53:41,175 --> 00:53:47,625
Hey!  Why, you little!  
HEY!

384
1631
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,989
I'm going now.  Anyway, thanks.

385
1635
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:27,895
What? I can't hear you !

386
1639
00:54:30,389 --> 00:54:31,725
I said thank you.

387
1643
00:54:31,725 --> 00:54:32,329
What?

388
1647
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:35,762
What?
 I said, THANK YOU!!

389
1652
00:54:35,762 --> 00:54:42,103
Just a plain "thank you" would've sufficed.  For being a commoner, all you have is your big pride.

390
1656
00:54:42,103 --> 00:54:48,909
That's it.  I take it back! 
  What? 
  I'm taking back the thank you!

391
1662
00:54:48,909 --> 00:54:55,181
What was I thinking?  People don't change that easily.  I'm leaving.

392
1666
00:54:55,181 --> 00:54:59,652
Hey, Jan Di Baht (field of grass) 
 What!

393
1671
00:54:59,652 --> 00:55:03,890
You 
don't drink when I'm not around.

394
1676
00:58:08,707 --> 00:58:13,879
Seo Hyun Unni?  What brings you here?

395
1680
00:58:13,879 --> 00:58:24,324
I had to take care of something regarding my dropping out of school. 
 I wanted to see you one more time before I left. What a relief.

396
1685
00:58:24,324 --> 00:58:32,430
Dropping out of school?  You're really not going to come back?

397
1689
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:36,003
Perhaps.
 When are you leaving?

398
1694
00:58:36,003 --> 00:58:44,709
Tomorrow.
Ah. So soon?

399
1699
00:58:44,709 --> 00:58:54,587
I still haven't been able to say thank you . . . 
 I haven't even returned the favor.

400
1704
00:58:54,587 --> 00:58:59,226
If you keep saying things like that then I'm going to be sad.

401
1708
00:59:02,364 --> 00:59:13,874
I knew from the moment I saw you, that it was you whom Ji Hoo talked about with a smile on his face..

402
1712
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:01,188
Um.. Unni.

403
1716
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,767
Jan Di,  What are you doing?

404
1720
01:00:15,767 --> 01:00:28,581
I was a fan of yours way before I even met you. 
  So, that's why I know better than anyone why you made this kind of decision.

405
1725
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:29,995
But...

406
1729
01:00:33,018 --> 01:00:37,022
I'm begging you, please don't leave.

407
1733
01:00:40,025 --> 01:00:42,960
Please stand up.

408
1737
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:52,237
I know that I have no right to make this kind of request and that you have no reason to listen to me, 
but if I don't even try . . .

409
1742
01:00:52,237 --> 01:00:55,331
Is it  because of Ji Hoo?

410
1746
01:01:01,836 --> 01:01:07,151
I don't know anything about Senior Ji Hoo

411
1750
01:01:07,151 --> 01:01:20,665
But, 
 I do know how much he cares about you.

412
1755
01:01:24,969 --> 01:01:32,177
And for some reason, I can see the sad look in his eyes.  But, there are times when he does smile.

413
1759
01:01:35,714 --> 01:01:41,887
He smiles so warmly that whoever is watching him feels that warmth.

414
1763
01:01:45,357 --> 01:01:57,803
The only person who can make him smile is you.  
If you leave like this, he may never smile again.

415
1768
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:06,478
Please stand up.

416
1772
01:02:18,522 --> 01:02:31,102
To me, when a person tries to decide what to do, it's similar to buying something in a foreign country.

417
1776
01:02:31,102 --> 01:02:46,415
If you don't buy it at that very moment, then there's no second chance. 
 I know very well how agonizing that regret is.

418
1781
01:02:46,415 --> 01:02:55,993
Ji Hoo is an important person to me.
   And I also believe that I am to him as well.

419
1786
01:02:55,993 --> 01:03:02,101
That's why I don't believe that he would want me to regret my decision.

420
1790
01:03:03,769 --> 01:03:06,038
What do you think?

421
1794
01:03:08,908 --> 01:03:14,845
I'm sorry.  
I'm very sorry.

422
1799
01:03:14,845 --> 01:03:21,120
No, I'm really happy you said those things.

423
1803
01:03:22,421 --> 01:03:25,490
Thank you.

424
1807
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:27,259
Unni . . .

425
1811
01:03:27,259 --> 01:03:28,893
Oh, hang on.

426
1815
01:03:36,901 --> 01:03:45,510
Are these . . . for me?
As I told you, shoes are of the utmost importance.

427
1820
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:50,638
I'll pray that these shoes take you to great places without fail.

428
1824
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:58,722
I also have a request for you.

429
1828
01:03:58,722 --> 01:04:04,530
Please, make Ji Hoo  . . . smile again.

430
1832
01:04:26,584 --> 01:04:29,119
Who do you think you are?

431
1836
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,590
Who are you to say those things?

432
1840
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:36,118
Who asked you to make that kind of request?

01:04:36,118 --> 01:04:40,464
No, not a request.. to beg?

434
1848
01:04:40,464 --> 01:04:43,801
Don't you have any pride?

435
1852
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:48,805
It's not because I don't have any pride.

436
1856
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:56,348
It's because you're in such agony. 
Because you looked like you would die of sadness.

437
1861
01:04:56,348 --> 01:05:03,021
What's it to you?! 
It has nothing to do with you!

438
1866
01:05:06,224 --> 01:05:08,994
Get lost.
