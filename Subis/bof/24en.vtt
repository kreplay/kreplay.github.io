1
3
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,000
There's something going on with you, isn't there?

2
7
00:01:04,294 --> 00:01:05,548
You're not sleeping?

3
11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,729
Don't even think about lying to me.

4
15
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:12,426
There's nothing going on.

5
19
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,900
I want to live here with dad, you and San.

6
23
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:23,945
What?

7
27
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,873
Why?

8
31
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:29,293
What about Young Master Joon Pyo, school and everything?

9
35
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:34,100
Didn't I say it before? I have nothing to do with Goo Joon Pyo

10
39
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:39,638
Also, after putting up with so much humiliation, you still regret it?

11
43
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:40,970
Oh, gee!

12
47
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:47,587
So in this rural town selling fish, crabs and webfoot octopus and smelling of fish is how you want to live?

13
51
00:01:47,914 --> 00:01:49,050
What's wrong with that?

14
55
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:55,337
Oh my gosh...

15
59
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,409
We're done for!  We're finished!  What hope do we have to live for now?

16
63
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,891
Mom..

17
67
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,007
Forget it!

18
71
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:35,631
Yi Jung Sunbae...

19
75
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:55,529
There's still no news from Jan Di?

20
79
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:59,315
No. I don't know what she's thinking.

21
83
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:06,790
She hasn't called. She just said she went to a fishing village but never said where it is.

22
87
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:09,668
She must be doing ok. It's Geum Jan Di we're talking about.

23
91
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:15,337
You seem to know my friends better than I do.

24
95
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,651
Like I said before,

25
99
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:19,224
I have some knowledge when it comes to girls.

26
103
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:27,204
How is Joon Pyo doing?

27
107
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:29,681
He's a mess.

28
111
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:34,758
Ga Eul...

29
115
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:40,283
Don't you think it's time we start talking about us?

30
119
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:53,066
Ga Eul.

31
123
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,814
I...
I'll go first.

32
128
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:05,975
You don't have to feel burdened because of me.
I already know how you feel.

33
133
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,472
So, from now on, I won't look for you anymore.

34
137
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,518
Ga Eul!

35
141
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:23,869
Eun Jae teacher said before, that because she did everything 
that was within her power, that she has no regrets.

36
146
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:28,018
Thank you.

37
150
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:31,666
For giving me the chance to do everything I could

38
154
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,702
If I hear from Jan Di, I will inform you.

39
158
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:39,211
Bye.

40
162
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:51,371
What can we do?

41
166
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:59,586
Mister, I am so afraid that our Joon Pyo might break. I'm really afraid.

42
170
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,020
Miss.. you can't be like this too.

43
174
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,859
No.

44
178
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:09,029
I have a really bad feeling about this.

45
182
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:19,648
Miss?

46
186
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:42,635
Dad.... Dad...

47
190
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:44,673
DAD!!!!

48
194
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:12,362
How could you do this?

49
198
00:08:13,682 --> 00:08:17,596
Can't you see it's already hard without you screaming about it?

50
202
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:23,229
Mom.... No, I don't even want to call you mom anymore.

51
206
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:31,334
How...  How could a person..
How could someone do something like that?

52
211
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,224
What exactly are you talking about??

53
215
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:36,918
How could you say that dad was dead when he's still alive?!

54
219
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:41,358
You... 
 How did I know?

55
224
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:43,883
You're wondering about that at a time like this?

56
228
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:45,930
I'm asking you.

57
232
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,692
Leaving Dad buried like that, did you intend to deceive me forever?!

58
236
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:51,598
Why did you do that?! WHY?!

59
240
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,476
This is what your father would have wanted.

60
244
00:08:57,607 --> 00:09:00,140
W... W... What?

61
248
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:09,544
I said I would take care of everything, but your dad suddenly collapsed. 
He isn't different from a living corpse.

62
253
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:16,598
The head of the famous ShinHwa Group, I couldn't allow the last memories of him to become like that.

63
257
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:20,882
My pride wouldn't allow it.

64
261
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:26,289
Pride...
Now...

65
266
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:35,066
You're saying you lied to the world and even to your children, that my living father was dead due to pride?

66
270
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:39,507
It was for your dad.

67
274
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:44,196
What is this about?

68
278
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,426
Joon Pyo....

69
282
00:09:51,663 --> 00:09:55,135
I'll explain everything. I...

70
286
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:58,275
I'm asking what does it mean?

71
290
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:31,906
<i>When dad is not around what do you have to do?</i>

72
294
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:36,193
<i>I have to take care of mom, noona, and ShinHwa Group!</i>

73
298
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,683
<i>Goo Joon Pyo, can you promise me that man to man?</i>

74
302
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:41,835
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

75
306
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:51,206
Your father tried his hardest till the very end for this group, which you can throw away any minute.

76
310
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:55,276
Are you thinking of abandoning him as well?

77
314
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,088
I'm sorry, young master.

78
318
00:11:07,338 --> 00:11:08,490
I am really sorry.

79
322
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:53,635
<i>This time, it was me who realized that you and I were from two different worlds.</i>

80
326
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:59,741
<i>As much as you try to deny it, you are still ShinHwa Group's Goo Joon Pyo.</i>

81
330
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:03,945
I haven't once forgotten that.

82
334
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:22,127
<i>I have come to the fish market today.
Everyone look at the fresh fish here.</i>

83
339
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:25,898
<i>The stall is full of fish.</i>

84
343
00:13:25,898 --> 00:13:29,170
<i>- Look at this octopus.
- $10!</i>

85
348
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,344
<i>- It seems this is the season for octopus.
- $10!</i>

86
353
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:37,882
<i>Sure! It's drop-dead delicious!
 I'll give it to you cheap, so buy some.</i>

87
358
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:44,721
You hear that? Why don't you set today's dinner table with this webfoot octopus in season?

88
362
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:47,813
<i>This is the Saeuh Island and 
I'm reporter Joh Bo Ram.</i>

89
367
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:06,568
I'm going to see dad. Will you go with me?

90
371
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:08,169
I'm not going.

91
375
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:11,005
Joon Pyo...

92
379
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:26,688
Joon Pyo.

93
383
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:30,993
Come talk with Mom.

94
387
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,397
Mom ?

95
391
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:50,478
Do you really think that you were even once my mom?

96
395
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:03,357
Why don't you quit with the act of being a mother when it doesn't suit you, Chairwoman Kang.

97
399
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:28,045
I have no interest.

98
403
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:30,885
What? 
 If you're going to go, go by yourself.

99
408
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,921
Goo Joon Pyo

100
412
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:37,723
Joon Pyo, are you serious? 
Don't be like this. Go and see her once.

101
417
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:45,533
I said I'm not interested!

102
421
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,841
I'll ask you one more time.

103
425
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:54,742
Are you sure?

104
429
00:15:58,163 --> 00:16:00,248
If you miss her so much, you should go.

105
433
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:06,821
Then I'm going first.  Whether you go or not, you do whatever you want.

106
437
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:41,389
When times are like this, don't you need Geum Jan Di the most?

107
441
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,859
What can I do by bringing her back here?

108
445
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,934
There is nothing that I can promise her....promising her that I'd always make her laugh,

109
449
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,807
...that I'd always make her happy so just trust in me 
I've lost the confidence to keep those kinds of promises.

110
454
00:16:58,807 --> 00:16:59,788
Joon Pyo.

111
458
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:02,177
The fact that I am the son of that kind of person.

112
462
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:06,047
The fact that I am a member of that kind of family.

113
466
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:11,753
Even I hate it.  So how do you think she feels?

114
470
00:17:14,203 --> 00:17:17,926
With all that she's had to endure already,
 I'm sure she really hates it.

115
475
00:17:17,926 --> 00:17:20,094
It's Geum Jan Di, 
so the situation can be different.

116
480
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:21,996
That's even more reason not to.

117
484
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,300
Because it's the woman that I love.

118
488
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,070
That's why it's not going to
 happen even more now.

119
493
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,852
It would have been nice 
if we sold the rest of that

120
498
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,823
Mom, I'm hungry! 
Oh, I'm sorry, San.  I will have it ready soon.

121
503
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:57,732
What's going on?

122
507
00:17:57,732 --> 00:18:00,735
What's going on? 
That's what we want to ask you.

123
512
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:06,875
There's a limit to your thinking what dumb country folk we are!  What kind of scam are you trying to pull?

124
516
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:09,144
A scam?

125
520
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,915
You said you were the future 
daughter-in-law of ShinHwa Group!

126
525
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:14,326
My daughter says that there is someone else who is the future daughter-in-law.

127
529
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:19,020
See this?  This lady is the heiress to a group much bigger than ShinHwa!

128
533
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,189
The fact that they were going to get married was even on the news!

129
537
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:24,158
That's old news.

130
541
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:30,431
What?  So you mean you're really
 the future daughter-in-law of ShinHwa?

131
546
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:33,601
Well, that's not quite it either.

132
550
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:36,771
We don't care!  Just give us back the money that you borrowed right now!!

133
554
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:38,773
What? Right now?

134
558
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:41,809
Yes!  You never know, you just might run away in the middle of the night tonight!

135
562
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:42,806
That's right!

136
566
00:18:42,806 --> 00:18:48,616
Look at what you've already just sat around and received! 
 There's no difference between that and scamming us!

137
571
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:52,252
Pay us even the interest right now!!!

138
575
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:54,758
Why all of a sudden.....

139
579
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,169
I'll pay it.

140
583
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:11,840
Sunbae..

141
587
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,475
Oh... that... that... master is...

142
591
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:19,513
That money.
I'll repay it.

143
596
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:32,694
What should we do?

144
600
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:35,931
Did you see that, see that?

145
604
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:42,070
I guess it was true that she had a rich future son-in-law!

146
608
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,305
So is he the heir of ShinHwa Group?

147
612
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:48,243
Oh, just look at his face!
He had a sense of nobility flowing out of him!

148
617
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:51,613
Oh, my.  I've never seen such a handsome Young Master..

149
621
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:52,904
I envy them.

150
625
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:06,093
I'm not going to die alone.
I'm not going to die alone!

151
630
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,815
How did you know that I was here?

152
634
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:30,151
I heard it....

153
638
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,589
The emergency bell.

154
642
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:40,194
I tossed and turned every night, 
afraid that I wouldn't be able to hear it.

155
647
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:48,407
How can this happen?

156
651
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:53,840
How can a person do such a thing?

157
655
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:02,042
I... have received so much from you, Sunbae.

158
659
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,999
But you have given me more...

159
663
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:03,439
How is Grandpa doing?

160
667
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:10,875
As usual he's attending to work and will probably continue until he collapses again.

161
671
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,741
That is so like him.

162
675
00:22:31,495 --> 00:22:33,158
Grandpa gave me this.

163
679
00:22:34,046 --> 00:22:37,036
It was what my Grandma gave my mother.

164
683
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:40,446
Sunbae.

165
687
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:44,286
I don't know when I started to feel like this.

166
691
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:45,775
but...

167
695
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:48,753
I cannot live without you.

168
699
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:10,904
I cannot accept this.

169
703
00:23:18,384 --> 00:23:19,420
Jan Di.

170
707
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:22,268
I told myself I can forget it....

171
711
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:28,616
I thought I had forgotten it all.

172
715
00:23:30,802 --> 00:23:32,612
However

173
719
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:36,034
However...

174
723
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:47,319
I can't seem to be able to throw this away.

175
727
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:52,126
I just can't seem to let it go....

176
731
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,063
I can't separate Goo Joon Pyo from me.

177
735
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,232
I'm sorry.

178
739
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,046
I'm sorry Sunbae.

179
743
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:13,729
It's ok.

180
747
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,631
It's ok.

181
751
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:57,718
<i>Jan Di...
I can't give her up.</i>

182
756
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:02,682
<i>Even though I always make things hard for her.</i>

183
760
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:07,071
<i>I've sometimes thought it might be better to let her go to you.</i>

184
764
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:09,239
<i>No...</i>

185
768
00:25:11,138 --> 00:25:14,176
<i>If I had to give Jan Di to another guy...</i>

186
772
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:18,931
<i>I don't even want to think about it.  But if I had to,</i>

187
776
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,495
<i>I thought you should be the one.</i>

188
780
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:28,230
<i>It can't be anyone else but you, Ji Hoo.</i>

189
784
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:30,607
<i>I've thought about that.</i>

190
788
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:15,982
I won't die alone.

191
792
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:18,725
I will see to ShinHwa's end!

192
796
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,311
I won't go down alone.

193
800
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:43,620
NO!

194
804
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:03,917
Joon Pyo.

195
808
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,033
Joon Pyo!

196
812
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:07,365
Joon Pyo!!

197
816
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,723
Joon Pyo!

198
820
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:10,918
Yah, Goo Joon Pyo.

199
824
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,328
Wake up.

200
828
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:13,896
Goo Joon Pyo!

201
832
00:27:18,523 --> 00:27:22,385
They brought on their own misfortunes.

202
836
00:27:24,057 --> 00:27:25,833
This isn't your fault.

203
840
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:27,828
This isn't your fault.

204
844
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:28,981
Goo Joon Pyo!

205
848
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,901
Wake up!

206
852
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:34,010
Hello?

207
856
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:35,943
My friend is dying.

208
860
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,947
I said my friend is dying!

209
864
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:42,604
Joon Pyo...

210
868
00:27:43,044 --> 00:27:43,996
Joon Pyo!

211
872
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,052
Wake up.

212
876
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,066
Yah!!

213
880
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:48,142
Wake Up!!

214
884
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:09,054
<i>Breaking news. Tonight at 8 p.m., in a coastal town, the heir to ShinHwa Group, Goo Joon Pyo,</i>

215
888
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,248
<i>was the victim of an assault and this</i>

216
892
00:28:11,248 --> 00:28:19,785
<i>has sent shock throughout.  
The assailant who was caught at the scene said he was done wrong by ShinHwa Group</i>

217
897
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:22,702
<i>and did it as an act of revenge for a hostile takeover.</i>

218
901
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:01,207
Are you satisfied? Is this what you wanted?

219
905
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:03,636
Is this really what you wanted?

220
909
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:08,756
Miss, please calm down.

221
913
00:29:08,756 --> 00:29:15,988
You said in the end, it was all for Joon Pyo. 
That you were handing all of ShinHwa Group's assets to Joon Pyo.

222
918
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:23,384
Look...look at what your so-called 
future happiness has done to your son.

223
923
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:36,375
Mother, do you have a single idea as to what your son likes to eat, what he likes, what he wants to become?

224
927
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,427
The surgery went well.

225
931
00:29:41,427 --> 00:29:43,482
The critical part is over.

226
935
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,923
That's good.

227
939
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:53,559
Let's Go.

228
943
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:55,594
What did you say?

229
947
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,730
There's an urgent meeting in Hong Kong.

230
951
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,601
Was it not enough with just Dad?

231
955
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:09,877
Answer me!  What is more important 
to you? ShinHwa or Joon Pyo.

232
960
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:11,978
Answer my question!

233
964
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,681
Joon Pyo...

234
968
00:32:00,982 --> 00:32:03,625
he loves rolled up egg and ramen.

235
972
00:32:07,387 --> 00:32:10,861
He especially loves eating fish cakes from street vendors.

236
976
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,164
He can eat 20 at one sitting.

237
980
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:23,191
He likes packing lunch and going on a picnic.

238
984
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:29,586
With the telescope that his parents bought him,

239
988
00:32:29,586 --> 00:32:31,537
he also loves to star gaze.

240
992
00:32:41,536 --> 00:32:42,869
Don't worry...

241
996
00:32:44,716 --> 00:32:45,421
Goo Joon Pyo...

242
1000
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,582
He's going to be okay.

243
1004
00:33:21,993 --> 00:33:24,190
Joon Pyo...
 Joon Pyo..

244
1009
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,398
Are you okay?...
 Joon Pyo..

245
1014
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:27,865
Joon Pyo

246
1018
00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:29,463
Joon Pyo, it's your sister.

247
1022
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,425
Joon Pyo was transferred to a room.

248
1026
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:07,898
Why don't you go?

249
1030
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:12,082
If he knows you're next to him, he'll wake up soon.

250
1034
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:10,674
Stop here for a minute.

251
1038
00:35:36,557 --> 00:35:42,234
Mom, do you have any idea what your son likes to eat,

252
1042
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:46,606
what he likes to do or what he wants to do?

253
1046
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,512
<i>Jon Pyo....</i>

254
1050
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:54,469
<i>He loves rolled up egg and ramen.</i>

255
1054
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:02,985
<i>He especially likes eating fish cakes from street vendors.</i>

256
1058
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,210
<i>He can eat 20 at one sitting.</i>

257
1062
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,328
Move on.

258
1066
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:29,881
<i>I don't know when I started to feel this way.
But...</i>

259
1071
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,350
<i>I cannot live without you.</i>

260
1075
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:36,294
<i>Joon Pyo...
 Joon Pyo!</i>

261
1080
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,030
<i>I told you so, didn't I?</i>

262
1084
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,131
<i>If not you, no one else.</i>

263
1088
00:38:28,148 --> 00:38:29,379
Grandfather

264
1092
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:44,552
Ji Hoo...

265
1096
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,561
Grandfather

266
1100
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,826
Ok...  Ok...  Ok...

267
1104
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:32,696
<i>Say it.   Aside from ShinHwa and being a plutocrat...</i>

268
1108
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:38,861
<i>Have you ever seen me... 
 as just a normal guy?</i>

269
1113
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:42,500
<i>No</i>

270
1117
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:48,082
<i>No matter how much you struggle, you're still ShinHwa Group's Goo Joon Pyo.</i>

271
1121
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:54,012
<i>I never forgot that, not even for a single moment.</i>

272
1125
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:05,837
Goo Joon Pyo.

273
1129
00:40:08,544 --> 00:40:10,016
Can you hear me?

274
1133
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:17,082
I lied to you again.

275
1137
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:23,843
To me, you

276
1141
00:40:23,843 --> 00:40:26,120
no matter what, are Goo Joon Pyo.

277
1145
00:40:27,614 --> 00:40:32,125
Goo Joon Pyo...  The idiot who likes this Geum Jan Di.

278
1149
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,454
Jan Di who's not cute, has no money and no status.

279
1153
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:46,524
So wake up. Wake up.

280
1157
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:49,632
Wake up Goo Joon Pyo.

281
1161
00:40:49,632 --> 00:40:51,100
Goo Joon Pyo.

282
1165
00:41:23,626 --> 00:41:24,833
Hubby..

283
1169
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:27,103
Oh, Honey!  Everything's okay, right?

284
1173
00:41:27,103 --> 00:41:28,204
You're healthy, right?

285
1177
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,074
Us...we're home!

286
1181
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:36,246
It's all thanks to you.  You and all your hard work on that boat!

287
1185
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:40,789
Because the landlord felt bad about what happened before

288
1189
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,685
he rented it back to us cheaply!

289
1193
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,821
Dad! Once I become a pro gamer...

290
1197
00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:48,190
you don't have to be on the boat so hurry and come home!

291
1201
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,060
Daddy, daddy, daddy...we're okay so don't worry about us and just take care of  your health, okay?

292
1205
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,563
I understand honey.

293
1209
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:55,531
Come home soon!

294
1213
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,583
Sunbae.

295
1217
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,152
Joon Pyo woke up.

296
1221
00:42:42,278 --> 00:42:43,846
Oh Jan Di.  You came.

297
1225
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,423
You just woke up and you look perfectly fine!

298
1229
00:42:54,423 --> 00:42:56,692
It definitely isn't like any human's recovery!

299
1233
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,996
Yo..my bro..welcome back.

300
1237
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:14,443
Thank you

301
1241
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:17,446
For what?

302
1245
00:43:17,446 --> 00:43:18,648
For being alive.

303
1249
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:24,020
Did you really think that this Goo Joon Pyo would leave this life like that?

304
1253
00:43:24,713 --> 00:43:26,022
It is definitely Joon Pyo.

305
1257
00:43:26,022 --> 00:43:27,690
Look at him, he's saying it was an unnatural death.

306
1261
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:33,329
Jan Di...why are you just standing there?

307
1265
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:35,964
Come here.  You were really worried, weren't you?

308
1269
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:37,833
All the tests came back normal.

309
1273
00:43:41,928 --> 00:43:44,674
Thank goodness... Goo Joon Pyo.

310
1277
00:43:44,674 --> 00:43:46,609
But who is that dorky-looking girl?

311
1281
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,715
Joon Pyo.

312
1285
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:53,916
You don't remember Geum Jan Di?

313
1289
00:43:54,571 --> 00:43:56,552
Don't joke around.

314
1293
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:57,931
Geum Jan Di?

315
1297
00:43:57,931 --> 00:43:59,121
What's that?

316
1301
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,891
Goo Joon Pyo...

317
1305
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:07,063
Joon Pyo, then do you remember your friends?

318
1309
00:44:07,963 --> 00:44:09,031
Are you joking?

319
1313
00:44:11,934 --> 00:44:13,269
Tell me my name.

320
1317
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,104
So Yi Jung

321
1321
00:44:15,104 --> 00:44:17,173
Then me... do you remember me?

322
1325
00:44:17,173 --> 00:44:18,674
psh... Song Woo Bin.

323
1329
00:44:21,189 --> 00:44:27,316
Do you really not know who Geum Jan Di is?

324
1333
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,722
Is she someone I should know?

325
1337
00:44:36,514 --> 00:44:38,227
Ji Hoo, is she your girl?

326
1341
00:45:03,525 --> 00:45:05,220
It's a partial memory loss.

327
1345
00:45:06,046 --> 00:45:12,695
For the patient, anything really stressful before the accident, he's forgotten.

328
1349
00:45:13,729 --> 00:45:16,298
But how is it possible that he can't remember just one person?

329
1353
00:45:17,345 --> 00:45:22,171
It's possible that memories regarding her are too painful or just too important..

330
1357
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:24,306
so if he concentrates on it too much,

331
1361
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,375
it could be erased selectively.

332
1365
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:32,212
Then, when might his memories come back?

333
1369
00:45:32,212 --> 00:45:34,282
Who knows?

334
1373
00:45:34,282 --> 00:45:36,552
Usually it's about six months.  But

335
1377
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:41,189
there are cases where it never returns.

336
1381
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:08,050
Goo Joon Pyo.  Hello

337
1385
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:11,155
The weather's totally awesome, isn't it?

338
1389
00:46:11,155 --> 00:46:12,554
Do you want to go for a walk?

339
1393
00:46:12,554 --> 00:46:13,794
You

340
1397
00:46:14,844 --> 00:46:18,164
Who do you think you are that you can come in any time you please?

341
1401
00:46:18,164 --> 00:46:19,361
Hm?

342
1405
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:22,029
Are you interested in me or something?

343
1409
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,398
Hm?

344
1413
00:46:23,398 --> 00:46:25,901
Aren't you supposed to be Ji Hoo's woman?!

345
1417
00:46:26,734 --> 00:46:29,771
Yah! I'm not anyone's girl!

346
1421
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:36,072
Well, more than Ji Hoo sunbae's, I'm more...your...

347
1425
00:46:36,072 --> 00:46:37,179
Get lost.

348
1429
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:39,781
Are you hard of hearing or something?

349
1433
00:46:40,248 --> 00:46:43,085
I said get out! Girls like you bring me bad luck!

350
1437
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:45,621
Goo Joon Pyo.

351
1441
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:50,559
Can you go out? I want to rest.

352
1445
00:47:45,981 --> 00:47:47,378
Why aren't you coming out!

353
1449
00:47:47,378 --> 00:47:51,374
Come out!  I said come out!!

354
1453
00:47:51,374 --> 00:47:52,963
I said come out!!

355
1457
00:48:04,322 --> 00:48:06,330
Unnie...here you go!

356
1461
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,420
So don't cry anymore, okay?

357
1465
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:19,705
You've got to hit the vending machine.  
Only then does it work.

358
1470
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,728
Thank you

359
1474
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:27,559
It seems like you've been admitted at this hospital for a while...

360
1478
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:31,643
What's your name? 
Yoo Mi.  Jang Yoo Mi.  A junior at Korea High.

361
1483
00:48:33,271 --> 00:48:35,326
I'm Geum Jan Di.

362
1487
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:36,710
ShinHwa High, Senior.

363
1491
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:38,403
You go to ShinHwa High?

364
1495
00:48:38,403 --> 00:48:40,276
Oh, that's just so great!

365
1499
00:48:40,276 --> 00:48:41,935
But who are you here to visit?

366
1503
00:48:44,461 --> 00:48:46,794
A friend.
Oh, I see.

367
1508
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:51,861
I broke my leg while skiing.

368
1512
00:48:55,792 --> 00:48:57,034
Want to sit here?

369
1516
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:08,946
Yoo Mi, you have such a vibrant personality.

370
1520
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:16,898
It's just that I get annoyed with people who are at hospitals who are sad or high strung...

371
1524
00:49:16,898 --> 00:49:18,453
I don't like that.

372
1528
00:49:20,731 --> 00:49:23,155
So how should one be towards people like that?

373
1532
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,855
For people how have been admitted for a long time and they're a little high strung and sensitive...

374
1536
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,272
Just naturally.

375
1540
00:49:32,272 --> 00:49:33,605
Naturally?

376
1544
00:49:38,765 --> 00:49:40,679
You over there! Are you ok?

377
1548
00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:53,701
Oppa...your condition looks pretty bad.  You really shouldn't walk around like that.

378
1552
00:49:53,701 --> 00:49:54,686
Oppa?

379
1556
00:49:54,686 --> 00:49:56,492
Do you want to ride in a wheelchair?

380
1560
00:49:56,492 --> 00:49:58,238
Don't concern yourself.

381
1564
00:49:58,238 --> 00:50:00,537
Then do you do want to borrow my crutches?

382
1568
00:50:00,537 --> 00:50:02,523
Oppa, do you know how to use crutches?

383
1572
00:50:03,864 --> 00:50:07,590
Hey, you little brat.  Don't act like we know each other and just go away.

384
1576
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,927
Oppa, your personality is pretty bad, isn't it?

385
1580
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:12,915
I'm not a little brat.  I'm Yoo Mi.   Jang Yoo Mi.

386
1584
00:50:12,915 --> 00:50:13,894
What?

387
1588
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:20,433
You're the oppa that's in that VIP room, aren't you?  I don't know what great person you are...
 but a patient is just another patient.

388
1593
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:23,630
Oh, wait..not quite.  At this hospital, Yu Mi is a sunbae!

389
1597
00:50:25,197 --> 00:50:27,543
If you don't want to break the remaining leg...

390
1601
00:50:27,543 --> 00:50:28,854
..I'd suggest you lean on me.

391
1605
00:50:30,657 --> 00:50:35,123
No, Yoo Mi! Your leg is injured. Let me help. Why don't you lean on me.

392
1609
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,878
You still haven't left?

393
1613
00:50:56,982 --> 00:50:58,915
Unni, see you next time!

394
1617
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:19,251
So how about shocking him with something.  Or...

395
1621
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:21,968
recreating some important event in the past?

396
1625
00:51:23,945 --> 00:51:25,951
Such as?

397
1629
00:51:25,951 --> 00:51:30,693
Of all the incidents with Geum JanDi, what was the event that had the most impact?

398
1633
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:54,651
Goo Joon Pyo.

399
1637
00:51:58,444 --> 00:51:59,414
What's with this girl?

400
1641
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:09,837
What the hell are you trying to do?!

401
1645
00:52:16,982 --> 00:52:19,267
If you come back to your senses, call me.

402
1649
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:22,920
What?

403
1653
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:26,342
Are you some kind of crazy girl?

404
1657
00:52:30,696 --> 00:52:32,072
What kind of woman are you?

405
1661
00:52:32,072 --> 00:52:32,995
Joon Pyo...

406
1665
00:52:32,995 --> 00:52:34,223
Don't you remember anything?

407
1669
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:36,313
What the hell am I supposed to remember!?

408
1673
00:52:38,307 --> 00:52:41,328
What kind of bad luck is this with this bum-like chick?

409
1677
00:52:47,624 --> 00:52:48,581
Has it been too long ago?

410
1681
00:52:48,581 --> 00:52:51,324
No.  I think this incident was too weak.

411
1685
00:52:51,324 --> 00:52:53,300
Next time, let's try something stronger.

412
1689
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,389
Stronger?

413
1693
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:17,769
Didn't I tell you I was at the limits of my patience?

414
1697
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:26,611
Yah! Who the hell do you think you're messing with?

415
1701
00:53:27,395 --> 00:53:29,158
Just because you're Ji Hoo's girlfriend, doesn't mean I'm going to hold back!

416
1705
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:32,293
Goo Joon Pyo.

417
1709
00:53:34,154 --> 00:53:36,955
I'm warning you. I'm not going to go soft on you!

418
1713
00:53:36,955 --> 00:53:38,444
I've warned you!

419
1717
00:54:12,652 --> 00:54:13,919
Hey Ji Hoo

420
1721
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,862
I don't ever want to see this crazy girl again!

421
1725
00:54:17,942 --> 00:54:19,183
Do you hear me?

422
1729
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,522
Don't worry.

423
1733
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:20,209
You're not someone that can be forgotten that easily.

424
1737
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:29,160
Maybe because it was so hard on him that he wanted to forget.

425
1741
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,927
If it was a bond that could be forgotten just because you want to forget...

426
1745
00:55:34,927 --> 00:55:36,822
would it have been easier?

427
1749
00:55:41,554 --> 00:55:42,879
No way!

428
1753
00:55:42,879 --> 00:55:46,040
Who in the world gets special crutches??

429
1757
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,938
I'm telling you the truth.

430
1761
00:55:47,938 --> 00:55:50,376
Do you really think Goo Joon Pyo will use any old crutches?

431
1765
00:55:50,376 --> 00:55:51,944
Here...you hold it.

432
1769
00:55:53,746 --> 00:55:57,799
Oh, seriously.  Why is this thing so light? It doesn't feel like I'm holding anything.

433
1773
00:55:57,799 --> 00:55:59,624
This is what's called titanium.

434
1777
00:56:00,512 --> 00:56:02,288
That's really funny, Oppa.

435
1781
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:05,736
Joo Pyo.

436
1785
00:56:05,736 --> 00:56:06,729
Oh Ji Hoo.

437
1789
00:56:06,729 --> 00:56:07,800
Oh, you were there?

438
1793
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,524
Jan DI unnie.

439
1797
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:13,798
Hello..

440
1801
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:16,129
Unni, did you see Joon Pyo oppa's crutches?

441
1805
00:56:16,129 --> 00:56:20,854
They're titanium.  Pretty funny, huh? It's not like he's Iron Man or anything.

442
1809
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:26,359
Jan Di unni's friend is so handsome.

443
1813
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:34,314
Hello. I'm Jang Yoo Mi.  Nice to meet you.

444
1817
00:56:40,035 --> 00:56:42,029
It's cold. Let's go back inside.

445
1821
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:14,595
Who is it?

446
1825
00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:24,560
I have brought pizza.

447
1829
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:32,301
It'll be so great if I could see it through a telescope or something.

448
1833
00:57:32,301 --> 00:57:33,912
Oppa, do you like stars?

449
1837
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:37,566
Stars?

450
1841
00:57:39,647 --> 00:57:42,076
The brightest star in winter...

451
1845
00:57:43,081 --> 00:57:46,116
In other words, like Goo Joon Pyo.

452
1849
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:52,917
Then, I am this star.

453
1853
00:57:58,481 --> 00:58:01,015
Oppa. What's wrong? Are you hurting somewhere?

454
1857
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:07,214
There's something important that I seem to have forgotten.

455
1861
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,967
I can't remember it.

456
1865
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,398
My chest feels so tight that I feel like I'm going to burst.

457
1869
00:58:15,582 --> 00:58:17,362
Don't stress too much over it.

458
1873
00:58:17,362 --> 00:58:20,672
If it's important, it will come back eventually.

459
1877
00:58:20,672 --> 00:58:24,755
If it doesn't come back, doesn't it mean that it wasn't really that important to begin with?

460
1881
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:27,033
If you keep stressing about it, it won't be good for you physically.

461
1885
00:58:34,869 --> 00:58:36,376
Yo..What's up?

462
1889
00:58:36,376 --> 00:58:37,764
Are you okay?

463
1893
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,201
Hello..

464
1897
00:58:39,201 --> 00:58:40,277
We meet again.

465
1901
00:58:40,277 --> 00:58:42,175
We are H.C.

466
1905
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:43,511
H.C.??

467
1909
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:45,105
Hospital couple.

468
1913
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:49,080
All the patients and the nurses basically gave us that official title.

469
1917
00:58:49,936 --> 00:58:51,823
What do you think? Do we suit each other?

470
1921
00:58:52,772 --> 00:58:53,506
Joon Pyo...

471
1925
00:58:54,441 --> 00:58:56,041
Do you still not remember anything ?

472
1929
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:58,778
What exactly am I supposed to remember?

473
1933
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:00,234
Geum Jan Di.

474
1937
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,271
You don't remember?

475
1941
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,066
So why do you keep talking about Jan Di or something?!

476
1945
00:59:05,066 --> 00:59:07,187
I mean why should I remember your girl?

477
1949
00:59:08,554 --> 00:59:09,989
Oh, forget it!

478
1953
00:59:10,023 --> 00:59:13,226
I don't know where you met this girl...so unsophisticated..

479
1957
00:59:13,226 --> 00:59:14,761
What does she think she is...a gang member or something?

480
1961
00:59:16,062 --> 00:59:17,864
Just make sure she doesn't come in and out of my hospital room.

481
1965
00:59:17,864 --> 00:59:19,003
Goo Joon Pyo!

482
1969
00:59:21,134 --> 00:59:22,235
Please Stop.

483
1973
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,124
What is wrong with him?

484
1977
01:00:09,015 --> 01:00:09,649
Sunbae.

485
1981
01:00:22,762 --> 01:00:24,063
I'll bring tea.

486
1985
01:00:26,432 --> 01:00:27,366
I'm sorry

487
1989
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:36,275
Why should you be sorry?

488
1993
01:00:36,275 --> 01:00:37,777
I'm the one who is sorry.

489
1997
01:00:39,063 --> 01:00:40,880
I got so mad without even my knowing...

490
2001
01:00:44,618 --> 01:00:48,011
I didn't stop you because I thought Joon Pyo would be hurt.

491
2005
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:51,973
If you hit him, I thought you would be hurt more, emotionally.

492
2009
01:00:51,973 --> 01:00:54,937
That's why I stopped you .

493
2013
01:00:59,924 --> 01:01:02,378
How long did you wait outside?

494
2017
01:01:02,378 --> 01:01:04,994
Why are your hands so cold?

495
2021
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,218
Let me see.

496
2025
01:01:15,871 --> 01:01:17,869
The one that's cold

497
2029
01:01:17,869 --> 01:01:20,154
is your heart.

498
2033
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:25,631
You don't have to pretend to be strong in front of me.

499
2037
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,558
I'm not pretending to be strong.

500
2041
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:36,237
It's because you're here.

501
2045
01:01:37,675 --> 01:01:41,013
You being here gives me strength.

502
2049
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,148
I'll go make tea.

503
2053
01:02:36,538 --> 01:02:42,619
Abracadabra,  Goo Joon Pyo, remember Geum Jan Di.

504
2057
01:02:42,619 --> 01:02:44,369
I remember.

505
2061
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:46,380
The thing I forgot is...

506
2065
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,000
you, right? 
 It's all over now.

507
2070
01:02:51,056 --> 01:02:53,177
That in this ridiculous way...

508
2074
01:02:53,177 --> 01:02:55,210
...you guys are ending....

509
2078
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:58,449
I can't go along with it.

510
2082
01:02:58,449 --> 01:03:01,270
That girl's facial expression...I can't seem to erase...

511
2086
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:02,198
In the end...

512
2090
01:03:02,198 --> 01:03:05,032
Geum Jan Di and Goo Joon Pyo...

513
2094
01:03:06,843 --> 01:03:08,558
only amounted to this.

514
2098
01:03:08,558 --> 01:03:10,936
This is all it amounted to..

515
2102
01:03:14,279 --> 01:03:19,347
We have gathered you all here to announce something special.

516
2106
01:03:19,347 --> 01:03:26,113
Goo Joon Pyo and Jang Yoo Mi, have decided to go study in the US next month.
