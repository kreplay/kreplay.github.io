1
3
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,728
Tell me not to do it.

2
7
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:57,628
Tell me to not go!!

3
11
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:21,086
Jae Kyung is looking for Geum Jan Di.

4
15
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:06,900
It seems the groom is running way too late...

5
19
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,447
The groom is entering.

6
23
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:26,213
The bride is entering.

7
27
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:17,898
Starting now,

8
31
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:25,487
the ceremony for the union of Goo Joon Pyo and Ha Jae Kyung will begin.

9
35
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:43,825
To this couple comes marriage and the union of the bride and groom.

10
39
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:53,503
If anyone objects, please speak now,

11
43
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:58,672
or forever hold your peace.

12
47
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:02,250
The Lord . . .

13
51
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:11,358
What are you doing right now?

14
55
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:14,519
I...

15
59
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:17,210
I object to this wedding.

16
63
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,370
Jae Kyung!

17
67
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,068
Jae Kyung, what are you doing?!

18
71
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:32,099
I, bride Ha Jae Kyung, object to this wedding.

19
75
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:33,640
Wh-What?

20
79
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,152
Aren't there any others who object?

21
83
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,849
I also object.

22
87
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,093
I also object.

23
91
00:06:46,093 --> 00:06:47,041
Me too.

24
95
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:50,046
Me too.

25
99
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:51,535
I also object.

26
103
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:56,341
Jae Kyung.

27
107
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:59,162
This joke seems a little overboard.

28
111
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:00,834
Having fun is fine, but...

29
115
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,302
Madam Chairman,

30
119
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:04,021
also Mom and Dad;

31
123
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:06,842
This isn't a joke.

32
127
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:12,012
I can't go along with this marriage to Goo Joon Pyo.

33
131
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:24,527
No matter how much I think about it, marriage just doesn't suit me right now.

34
135
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:29,308
I'm sorry.

35
139
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:33,633
Because of my conduct, I've caused a lot of trouble.

36
143
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,170
Dad.

37
147
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,241
Because this is all my fault, please don't take it out on Shinhwa Group.

38
151
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:47,647
Madam Chairman.

39
155
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,616
and

40
159
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:51,084
Goo Joon Pyo,

41
163
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:55,508
I'm sincerely sorry.

42
167
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,060
Please forgive me.

43
171
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:07,334
Unbelievable.

44
175
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:20,580
What happened?

45
179
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:26,786
I'm usually a pretty cool girl.

46
183
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:29,723
Unni!

47
187
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,463
Oh yes, Chen...

48
191
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,469
Chen, how's it going?

49
195
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:46,865
We're taking her there right now.

50
199
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:20,432
Goo Joon Pyo!

51
203
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:21,773
Jan Di.

52
207
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:20,400
Until when are you going to keep crying?

53
211
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:22,235
If someone saw,

54
215
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,203
I would look like the bad guy.

55
219
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:28,220
Where can you find something more beautiful than a happy ending?

56
223
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:35,148
Jae Kyung unnie is so cool.

57
227
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:03,543
That day...

58
231
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:08,081
You asked why I didn't go, didn't you?

59
235
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:13,687
I...

60
239
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:16,989
don't believe in happy endings.

61
243
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:02,927
Are you ok ?

62
247
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:21,091
This is why I always tell you to be careful!

63
251
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:24,839
Sorry. 
 I'm okay..

64
256
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,961
You have guests, so I'll get going.

65
260
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:53,405
Weren't you waiting because you had something to tell me?

66
264
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:02,260
I have a favor to ask.

67
268
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:43,090
Jan Di...

68
272
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,499
I can't let her go.

69
276
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:50,437
Even though I always make things hard for her.

70
280
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:55,354
I've sometimes thought it might be better to let her go to you.

71
284
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,703
I didn't even want to think about it, but if I had to

72
288
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:05,118
I thought you should be the one.

73
292
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:10,988
It can't be anyone else but you, Ji Hoo.

74
296
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:12,359
Goo Joon Pyo.

75
300
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,862
Even so, I don't think I can.

76
304
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:23,815
This lawn (JanDi) is the same as usual.

77
308
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:26,401
I missed it.

78
312
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:23,792
Don't you regret it?

79
316
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:27,435
I do.

80
320
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:32,105
I've been regretting the moment I let Goo Joon Pyo go.

81
324
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:37,644
Ji Hoo, I was supporting you, but . . .

82
328
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:42,081
it's now a waste since I've given up.

83
332
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,975
So I can't even do that.

84
336
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,019
Not long ago,

85
340
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:52,225
I asked Joon Pyo:

86
344
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:56,062
"Between friendship and love,

87
348
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:58,732
If you were to pick only one,

88
352
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:01,408
What would you choose?".

89
356
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:09,136
He said he wouldn't give up either

90
360
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:15,549
They say people get as much as they are greedy for.

91
364
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:22,255
Neither you nor I have enough greed.

92
368
00:16:28,094 --> 00:16:30,163
I'm leaving for New York tomorrow.

93
372
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:38,705
Can you give this to Jan Di for me?

94
376
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:48,215
That J J

95
380
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,503
You have no idea how much I hoped it meant Ji Hoo and Jan Di.

96
384
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,857
Ji Hoo, you probably don't know.

97
388
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,133
Good luck!

98
392
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:13,907
Take care.

99
396
00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:14,972
Miss prepared this so that you can be comfortable.

100
400
00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:18,742
Excuse me.

101
404
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:24,244
Please give this message to Jae Kyung unni.

102
408
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,751
If it's okay with her, nothing has changed with our sister relationship.

103
412
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:46,186
Eat.

104
416
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,565
Geum Jan Di.

105
420
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:37,656
Would you like to dance with me?

106
424
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,106
I can't dance.

107
428
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:10,962
<i>There's something I've been wanting to ask you from the beginning.</i>

108
432
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:12,505
<i>What is it?</i>

109
436
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:17,009
<i>Why was it me?</i>

110
440
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:22,015
<i>Me, I'm not pretty, I don' t have money or anything.</i>

111
444
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,377
<i>Why do you even like me?</i>

112
448
00:22:26,097 --> 00:22:28,743
<i>Because I have everything.</i>

113
452
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:30,128
<i>What?</i>

114
456
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:36,195
<i>Because I have money, status, and looks. I have all that.</i>

115
460
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:38,375
<i>I don't need anything.</i>

116
464
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:42,136
<i>Geum Jan Di, all you need to be is Geum Jan Di</i>.

117
468
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:51,710
It's really pretty.

118
472
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:56,399
Do you see the brightest star right there?

119
476
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:57,339
Yes.

120
480
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:03,722
It's a star called Sirius in the Orion Constellation.

121
484
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:06,508
It's the brightest star in the winter sky.

122
488
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:10,166
You could say its existence looks like Goo Joon Pyo.

123
492
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:11,785
How?

124
496
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:15,564
Then I'm that one.

125
500
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:17,105
That one, that one, that one!

126
504
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,237
I want to be that one.

127
508
00:23:19,108 --> 00:23:21,189
You sure do have taste.

128
512
00:23:22,975 --> 00:23:25,512
Thats the second brightest star, Procyon.

129
516
00:23:26,843 --> 00:23:29,048
That's it, benevolence at someone else's expense.

130
520
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:32,421
You're always so outgoing and obnoxious

131
524
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:33,553
It suits you perfectly.

132
528
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:34,277
What?

133
532
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,891
But...

134
536
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:44,334
How did you get to like stars?

135
540
00:23:52,571 --> 00:23:55,252
When I was little,

136
544
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:58,100
my Dad sent me a telescope for my birthday.

137
548
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:08,131
He wrote in the card, "Study the stars well and we'll go look at them together."

138
552
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:11,788
So you went around looking at stars with your dad.

139
556
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:13,860
No.

140
560
00:24:15,263 --> 00:24:16,929
I never went, not even once.

141
564
00:24:18,097 --> 00:24:20,166
Why not?

142
568
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:25,921
Believing in that promise, I studied enough to go to major in astronomy, but

143
572
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,940
do you know what I got for Christmas a few years later?

144
576
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:34,881
A telescope.

145
580
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:49,662
It was then that I realized it wasn't my Father sending those gifts, but his secretary.

146
584
00:24:56,876 --> 00:24:58,271
Do you know what my dream is?

147
588
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:03,459
In the future, going to see the stars with your son.

148
592
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:05,183
How lame!

149
596
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:11,417
Not making promises I can't keep.

150
600
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:17,460
Jan Di.

151
604
00:25:20,334 --> 00:25:22,028
I'm sorry for hurting you.

152
608
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:26,365
Jan Di.

153
612
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,501
What now?

154
616
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:34,974
I love you.

155
620
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,989
Look at this bliss.

156
624
00:26:25,858 --> 00:26:27,426
When did you arrive?

157
628
00:26:27,426 --> 00:26:28,827
Jan Di!

158
632
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:29,662
Ga Eul!

159
636
00:27:05,597 --> 00:27:06,699
It's a relief.

160
640
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,201
What is?

161
644
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:09,836
That you're smiling.

162
648
00:27:17,977 --> 00:27:18,711
Here.

163
652
00:27:26,985 --> 00:27:28,420
This...

164
656
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,790
I don't know why she had it, but

165
660
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,292
she told me to give it to you.

166
664
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:36,796
Where is she right now?

167
668
00:27:40,432 --> 00:27:42,034
She's about to depart.

168
672
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:54,840
Miss, it's time to go in.

169
676
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:09,455
Unni! Jae Kyung unni! 
 Hey, monkey!

170
681
00:29:11,257 --> 00:29:13,692
Jan Di!  Goo Joon Pyo!

171
685
00:29:13,692 --> 00:29:14,994
How did you get here?

172
689
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:18,897
How can you just leave like this?

173
693
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:21,867
You weren't going to say goodbye to your little sis?

174
697
00:29:23,969 --> 00:29:25,804
What kind of unni does that?

175
701
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:29,108
Sorry!

176
705
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:33,846
I'm really weak when it comes to saying goodbye.

177
709
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:37,349
Even the fierce Ha Jae Kyung has a weak point?

178
713
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,584
That's right.

179
717
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:43,055
Have a safe journey.

180
721
00:29:44,423 --> 00:29:46,258
And...

181
725
00:29:46,258 --> 00:29:47,326
Thanks.

182
729
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:56,168
If you guys break up, I'll die from the injustice of it.

183
733
00:29:56,168 --> 00:30:00,392
So, if you want to break up, come report to me and get permission.

184
737
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:01,440
Got it?

185
741
00:30:05,343 --> 00:30:06,810
Unni...

186
745
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,651
Let me hug you once, my little sis Jan Di.

187
749
00:30:24,582 --> 00:30:26,232
I'm leaving.

188
753
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:46,655
Have an enjoyable flight.

189
757
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:23,155
This is mine.

190
761
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,517
I picked it though.

191
765
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,315
I had dibs on it first.

192
769
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:29,078
Hurry, let go!

193
773
00:31:31,594 --> 00:31:33,565
What are you? Hey!

194
777
00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:35,557
Hurry up and apologize, you jerk!

195
781
00:31:35,557 --> 00:31:37,150
Get down!

196
785
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,352
Apologize! Hurry!

197
789
00:32:16,842 --> 00:32:19,311
I know this also originally belonged to Jan Di.

198
793
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:22,703
But, just this one thing,

199
797
00:32:22,703 --> 00:32:25,659
this one thing, give it to me, please.

200
801
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,746
Don't you think I should have at least one special memory to treasure?

201
805
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:44,180
Shinhwa Group and JK's merger has become uncertain, and

202
809
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,540
the stock market and government are watching Shinhwa's movements.

203
813
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:56,641
Shinhwa Group were to become in-laws with the American-based JK but due to the broken engagement, Shinhwa is...

204
817
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,074
Hey. Open the door.

205
821
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:25,039
Hey!

206
825
00:33:26,911 --> 00:33:27,912
Open the door!

207
829
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:32,301
Hey! I said open the door!

208
833
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:36,663
Hey. Can't you hear me?

209
837
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:39,079
I said open the door!

210
841
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,825
This time, shouldn't you just come to my house?

211
845
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:46,398
What's the point of getting another house?

212
849
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:51,009
Who's to know whether that Evil Witch might tear down your house or kick you out in the middle of the night?

213
853
00:33:53,438 --> 00:33:55,811
I should probably pack my belongings right away.

214
857
00:33:56,608 --> 00:33:58,010
I'm really in trouble.

215
861
00:33:58,776 --> 00:34:00,395
There's no need for that.

216
865
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,940
I knew you were something else, but

217
869
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,138
I didn't see you as someone who could pretend to be innocent, yet run around doing these kind of sly things behind people's backs.

218
873
00:34:18,138 --> 00:34:20,314
It really is unbelievable.

219
877
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,216
It was my fault that I couldn't completely take care of things, but

220
881
00:34:25,216 --> 00:34:27,184
I didn't know I would regret it so much.

221
885
00:34:27,184 --> 00:34:29,874
Excuse me! Why are you treating Jan Di like this?

222
889
00:34:29,874 --> 00:34:33,679
Jan Di did nothing, but actually helped the two of them so they could work out.

223
893
00:34:39,122 --> 00:34:40,872
If you have eyes, look at it.

224
897
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:53,097
Because of a worthless thing like you, do you know what a huge problem has been created?

225
901
00:34:53,097 --> 00:34:56,572
A child like you couldn't even imagine the amount of damage that you've caused.

226
905
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:59,028
Look at what you have done to our household!

227
909
00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:03,308
I'm not going to just sit back and suffer anymore.

228
913
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,720
It'd be best if you don't think I'll let things go like I have been.

229
917
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:16,087
I will make sure that you realize and understand and come to regret 
how  monstrous a problem you've created.

230
922
00:35:16,087 --> 00:35:18,175
Isn't this what you wanted?

231
926
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:23,462
Hey there!  It seems you're going a bit too far in the way you're talking to the child.

232
930
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,699
Grandpa!

233
934
00:35:27,065 --> 00:35:30,101
Sir, how did you come to be here?

234
938
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:31,737
It's been a while, Shi Su.

235
942
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:35,774
Or do I need to call you Chairwoman Kang now?

236
946
00:35:39,611 --> 00:35:41,136
You've changed a lot.

237
950
00:35:43,148 --> 00:35:45,283
Let's talk about us later.

238
954
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,752
Let's talk about her first.

239
958
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:51,623
How do you know that child?

240
962
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:53,891
She's going to be my granddaughter-in-law.

241
966
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,895
What do you mean?

242
970
00:35:57,529 --> 00:36:01,747
She's the girl I picked just for Ji Hoo.

243
974
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:04,802
Grandfather!

244
978
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:06,437
Are you serious?

245
982
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:14,546
Until now, I just kept an eye on her, but now, she's no different than family.

246
986
00:36:14,546 --> 00:36:17,249
I would appreciate it if you didn't treat her so carelessly in the future.

247
990
00:36:22,322 --> 00:36:25,423
Jan Di, what are you doing?

248
994
00:36:25,423 --> 00:36:27,259
Get your bags and follow me!

249
998
00:36:27,973 --> 00:36:29,427
Y-Y-Yes.

250
1002
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:54,752
Sunbae.

251
1006
00:36:54,752 --> 00:36:58,973
Starting today, she's going to be living with us.

252
1010
00:36:58,973 --> 00:37:00,125
What?

253
1014
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:02,169
J iHoo, what are you doing?

254
1018
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:03,895
You should be showing her to her room.

255
1022
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,919
I came because Grandfather dragged me here, but

256
1026
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:32,257
I can go to Ga Eul's tomorrow.

257
1030
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:39,697
You kids!

258
1034
00:37:39,697 --> 00:37:44,202
Who said you two, all grown up boy and girl, could be in the same room together with the door closed?

259
1038
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,575
Grandfather, I'm sorry and I'm grateful.

260
1042
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:52,811
I'll spend the night here today.

261
1046
00:37:52,811 --> 00:37:55,413
Don't think about running away,

262
1050
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:57,082
and there's nothing to be grateful for.

263
1054
00:37:57,082 --> 00:38:01,666
You're the person that forced me into this house with that kid.

264
1058
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:04,389
I brought you here to punish you.

265
1062
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:05,290
What?

266
1066
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:10,295
Do you know how hard it is for me to walk on eggshells around that grandson of mine?

267
1070
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,134
Grandfather and Sunbae are . . . and I'm-

268
1074
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:19,638
If you have caused trouble, then you should take the blame for it and accept your punishment.

269
1078
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,821
Jan Di might feel uncomfortable here.

270
1082
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:12,324
It's not you who's uncomfortable?

271
1086
00:39:16,294 --> 00:39:20,499
I don't know anything about young people and their feelings being such and such.

272
1090
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,668
I suppose things will happen as fate wills it to.

273
1094
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,739
But that child

274
1098
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:30,842
has no place under heaven to go.

275
1102
00:39:30,842 --> 00:39:33,712
I want to become a guardian for that child.

276
1106
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:39,584
There's nothing to like or be uncomfortable about.

277
1110
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:45,390
But for a child like Jan Di to be paired with someone as stoic as you...

278
1114
00:39:46,491 --> 00:39:48,226
I'm against it, my boy.

279
1118
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:13,585
When I think about it,

280
1122
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:17,288
That was the first time Eun Jae asked for a favor.

281
1126
00:40:17,288 --> 00:40:20,559
That day, do you know what I was doing?

282
1130
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:24,996
I have a favor to ask.

283
1134
00:40:26,498 --> 00:40:27,532
Favor?

284
1138
00:40:34,806 --> 00:40:39,910
Tomorrow morning, by 7 come here to this place.

285
1142
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,246
Don't ask me for a reason.

286
1146
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:44,282
Cha Eun Jae.

287
1150
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,185
What is this?

288
1154
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:49,687
I'm leaving.

289
1158
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:55,460
Yi Jung!!

290
1162
00:40:56,995 --> 00:41:00,365
I really hope that you'll come out.

291
1166
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,058
<i>Mother</i>

292
1170
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,079
What is it now?

293
1174
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,151
A farewell trip?

294
1178
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:56,788
And if I get him for you?

295
1182
00:41:56,788 --> 00:41:58,523
What's the use?

296
1186
00:42:02,093 --> 00:42:03,061
Mom.

297
1190
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:05,697
Can't you just let him go now?

298
1194
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:10,635
Please.

299
1198
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:12,637
I said to give up now!

300
1202
00:43:05,523 --> 00:43:06,558
Please get in.

301
1206
00:43:19,704 --> 00:43:26,778
To be honest, I have a favor to ask of you, Miss Jandi.

302
1210
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:28,213
A favor?

303
1214
00:43:42,193 --> 00:43:44,396
Whenever you have spare time, as a part-time job,

304
1218
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:47,665
Can you come visit this person?

305
1222
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,202
Me?

306
1226
00:43:52,637 --> 00:43:55,339
You can tell him stories

307
1230
00:43:55,339 --> 00:43:57,275
or you can just show your face once in a while.

308
1234
00:43:59,456 --> 00:44:02,360
Who is this person?

309
1238
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,020
To me, he's like an older brother.

310
1242
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,940
He's the same as family.

311
1246
00:44:11,407 --> 00:44:14,426
But why did you ask me to do this?

312
1250
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:18,826
Because what this person needs the most...is warmth.

313
1254
00:44:21,373 --> 00:44:23,693
If I tell you that among the people I've met, you, Jan Di,

314
1258
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:26,171
seem to be the warmest person,

315
1262
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:29,223
would that be an answer?

316
1266
00:44:32,977 --> 00:44:36,080
Of course, you will be adequately compensated.

317
1270
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,948
Oh, no!

318
1274
00:44:37,948 --> 00:44:40,612
If it is something I can help with, then of course, I'll do it.

319
1278
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:48,188
This is a personal favor; neither the young master nor the Chairwoman must find out.

320
1282
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:50,277
Okay. Okay.

321
1286
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,535
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

322
1290
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:07,362
My name is Geum Jan Di. Though I'm lacking in much, I'll be a good friend to you.

323
1294
00:45:09,412 --> 00:45:12,390
Starting today, let's get along with each other.

324
1298
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,788
Fighting!

325
1302
00:46:07,822 --> 00:46:08,723
Young Master.

326
1306
00:46:10,212 --> 00:46:11,283
What happened to Jan Di?

327
1310
00:46:12,076 --> 00:46:13,216
Is she okay?

328
1314
00:46:13,216 --> 00:46:16,314
Dr. Yoon took her to his house.

329
1318
00:46:16,314 --> 00:46:17,500
To Ji Hoo's house?

330
1322
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,419
Right now, that is the safest place she can be.

331
1326
00:46:30,695 --> 00:46:32,077
Lend me your cell phone.

332
1330
00:46:55,495 --> 00:46:58,408
I feel assured since she's at your house.

333
1334
00:47:13,154 --> 00:47:14,182
Joon Pyo.

334
1338
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,619
Why am I feeling so anxious?

335
1342
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,243
My heart keeps feeling anguished.

336
1346
00:47:39,685 --> 00:47:41,851
<i> Goo Joon Pyo</i>

337
1350
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:07,858
Jan Di.

338
1354
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,728
Woo Bin Sunbae.

339
1358
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:24,809
These days feel like death warmed over.

340
1362
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:28,546
Yi Jung is acting like an invalid.

341
1366
00:48:28,546 --> 00:48:30,502
Joon Pyo's under house arrest.

342
1370
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:33,997
It's so stressful.  Look!

343
1374
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:35,518
Even my skin is a mess.

344
1378
00:48:38,189 --> 00:48:39,657
Don't worry too much.

345
1382
00:48:39,657 --> 00:48:40,992
It's nothing big.

346
1386
00:48:40,992 --> 00:48:43,260
He's just not allowed to go out.

347
1390
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:47,098
He destroyed a wedding in front of that important figure.

348
1394
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:48,866
It'd be even weirder if nothing happened.

349
1398
00:48:51,235 --> 00:48:53,999
In any case, I was planning on going to see Joon Pyo.

350
1402
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:55,946
Do you have any message you want me to pass on to him?

351
1406
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,457
Jan Di, are you okay?

352
1410
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:06,350
Ah!  As for me, well, I'm doing really well.

353
1414
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:10,104
What?

354
1418
00:49:10,104 --> 00:49:11,422
Why are you looking at me like that?

355
1422
00:49:12,256 --> 00:49:13,157
Just because.

356
1426
00:49:13,891 --> 00:49:18,629
Living at Ji Hoo's house, both you and Ji Hoo look comfortable.

357
1430
00:49:19,883 --> 00:49:25,051
Geum Jan Di, Goo Joon Pyo, Yoon Ji Hoo. You three.

358
1434
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:28,037
Whatever kind of fate it is...

359
1438
00:49:28,037 --> 00:49:30,641
it sure is complicated.

360
1442
00:49:30,641 --> 00:49:32,643
I'm just saying that's how it is.

361
1446
00:49:36,414 --> 00:49:37,848
Be strong, Geum Jan Di.

362
1450
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:41,885
And thanks.

363
1454
00:49:41,885 --> 00:49:42,953
For what?

364
1458
00:49:43,587 --> 00:49:45,089
Ji Hoo.

365
1462
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:48,359
I don't think I've ever seen him look so comfortable.

366
1466
00:49:49,126 --> 00:49:50,895
And about finding his grandfather.

367
1470
00:49:50,895 --> 00:49:52,163
It's all thanks to you.

368
1474
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:54,297
It's not.

369
1478
00:49:54,297 --> 00:49:57,960
No, lately I'm the one that is being a burden.

370
1482
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:07,111
Here. I'll clean your hands.

371
1486
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,216
It feels refreshing, doesn't it?

372
1490
00:50:25,162 --> 00:50:29,566
The worst kind of encounter is the fish meeting,

373
1494
00:50:29,566 --> 00:50:33,103
because meeting leaves a horrible fishy smell.

374
1498
00:50:33,103 --> 00:50:39,509
The encounter one must be most careful with is the flower meeting.

375
1502
00:50:39,509 --> 00:50:43,447
Because when it blooms, it has a wonderful fragrance, but when it wilts, it is thrown away.

376
1506
00:50:45,115 --> 00:50:51,654
The most beautiful encounter is the handkerchief meeting.

377
1510
00:50:51,654 --> 00:50:58,128
Because when you exert yourself, the sweat is wiped away, and when you're sad, the tears are wiped away.

378
1514
00:51:31,495 --> 00:51:35,065
I really like this phrase,

379
1518
00:51:36,834 --> 00:51:39,136
a handkerchief-like meeting.

380
1522
00:51:43,406 --> 00:51:45,376
Sir, how was it with you?

381
1526
00:51:47,445 --> 00:51:52,182
It would be great if I could be like a handkerchief to you.

382
1530
00:51:52,182 --> 00:51:53,384
Don't  you think?

383
1534
00:51:54,385 --> 00:51:56,119
Isn't that right, sir?

384
1538
00:52:01,091 --> 00:52:04,528
Then, I'll read you something different next.

385
1542
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:47,104
Do you want me to do it?

386
1546
00:52:50,408 --> 00:52:51,875
It's alright.

387
1550
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:54,144
If I leave you to yourself,

388
1554
00:52:54,144 --> 00:52:56,380
I don't think you'll be able to go to school tomorrow.

389
1558
00:53:21,338 --> 00:53:23,841
You can't right there!

390
1562
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:26,110
You can't cut the hair in the back!

391
1566
00:54:03,814 --> 00:54:05,115
I'll help you.

392
1570
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,452
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

393
1574
00:54:09,786 --> 00:54:13,657
You have to let me pay you back for trimming my hair.

394
1578
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:50,891
It's a car wash!

395
1582
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:31,337
I wanted to tell you.

396
1586
00:55:33,113 --> 00:55:34,837
That...

397
1590
00:55:41,324 --> 00:55:42,676
I love you.

398
1594
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:51,764
I wanted to say it out loud like that.

399
1598
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:53,653
That is all.

400
1602
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:36,861
Are you quitting?

401
1606
00:56:37,801 --> 00:56:39,734
Are you really going to run away like this?

402
1610
00:56:40,727 --> 00:56:42,764
Do you think that this is what she wants?

403
1614
00:56:42,764 --> 00:56:44,158
It doesn't matter anymore.

404
1618
00:56:44,158 --> 00:56:45,605
It matters to me.

405
1622
00:56:46,866 --> 00:56:49,974
In order to make your heart strong so that it isn't easily broken

406
1626
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:56,509
you said it needed to be molded and shaped and burned in fiery oven to endure that.

407
1630
00:56:56,509 --> 00:56:59,404
So that you don't have any regrets. You said that.

408
1634
00:56:59,404 --> 00:57:00,763
It was all nonsense.

409
1638
00:57:04,581 --> 00:57:06,522
It's not over yet.

410
1642
00:57:06,522 --> 00:57:08,234
You haven't done everything yet.

411
1646
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:10,323
I can't give up like this.

412
1650
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:13,955
I'm going to make this hand move again.

413
1654
00:57:29,218 --> 00:57:32,085
I just need to get in. 
 Go over there.

414
1659
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:30,977
Thank you.

415
1663
00:58:33,837 --> 00:58:35,091
Take care.

416
1667
00:58:39,092 --> 00:58:40,498
Hey, GaEul.

417
1671
00:58:41,734 --> 00:58:43,685
What's wrong? 
Are you okay?

418
1676
00:58:45,392 --> 00:58:48,701
Hey!  What are you doing these days?

419
1680
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:52,384
You haven't been sleeping and you've been coming out before the crack of dawn.

420
1684
00:58:53,847 --> 00:58:55,571
Tell me. What's wrong?

421
1688
00:58:57,477 --> 00:59:00,116
Is it something I can help you with?

422
1692
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:02,809
Don't worry.

423
1696
00:59:03,991 --> 00:59:07,352
I only have a little more to do before it's over.

424
1700
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:13,360
Are you ready?

425
1704
00:59:13,961 --> 00:59:15,322
Yeah. 
 Okay.

426
1709
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:17,379
Let's move out.

427
1713
00:59:20,283 --> 00:59:23,156
One. Two. Three.

428
1717
00:59:29,002 --> 00:59:31,137
I'm going out with my friend.

429
1721
00:59:31,137 --> 00:59:33,139
Whether you decide to follow or not, do whatever you want.

430
1725
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:35,277
Then we shall go as well.

431
1729
00:59:47,816 --> 00:59:49,853
Manager Lee, you're ready, right?

432
1733
01:00:06,101 --> 01:00:08,064
Catch them! 
 Hey! You almost caused an accident.

433
1738
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:16,172
Don't worry and do whatever you need.

434
1742
01:00:16,172 --> 01:00:17,984
I'll take good care of him.

435
1746
01:00:17,984 --> 01:00:20,387
Mom will be right back. Have fun with Noona.

436
1750
01:00:20,387 --> 01:00:21,514
Please take care of him.

437
1754
01:00:21,514 --> 01:00:24,090
Say "Bye, Mom." Bye, Mom.

438
1758
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:24,924
Take care.

439
1762
01:00:26,393 --> 01:00:28,495
Let's have fun.

440
1766
01:00:33,233 --> 01:00:34,434
Goo Joon Pyo!

441
1770
01:00:34,434 --> 01:00:36,508
Are you okay?

442
1774
01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:39,773
Right now?

443
1778
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:07,777
I'm tired.

444
1782
01:01:13,573 --> 01:01:14,607
What is it?

445
1786
01:01:15,587 --> 01:01:17,410
This isn't an 'it', it's a kid.

446
1790
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:20,513
We haven't seen each other in forever, why on earth would you bring a little leech with you?

447
1794
01:01:21,321 --> 01:01:22,982
Did you adopt him from somewhere?

448
1798
01:01:24,184 --> 01:01:25,906
Noona, let's go here.

449
1802
01:01:26,753 --> 01:01:28,178
Okay, let's go.

450
1806
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,358
I was wondering why you asked to meet at a zoo.

451
1810
01:01:32,811 --> 01:01:34,661
Is that little leech more important than I am?

452
1814
01:01:34,661 --> 01:01:38,392
If you don't want to be a leech yourself, then stop whining and follow me.

453
1818
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,233
Let's go.

454
1822
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,505
Let's go together.
