1
3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,774
I was thinking about how I could lure Goo Joon Pyo.

2
7
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:58,752
I saw this as an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone.

3
11
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:01,103
Who put you up to this?

4
15
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,166
Why?

5
19
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,256
It's kind of funny isn't it?

6
23
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:10,210
Joon Pyo is all fussy after losing his girl,

7
27
00:01:11,212 --> 00:01:13,955
and imagine his shock finding out it was his mother who paid for the whole thing.

8
31
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:18,030
His mom?

9
35
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:24,041
You mean, the person who put you up to this

10
39
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,658
is Goo Joon Pyo's mother?

11
43
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:28,035
If Sunbae had just gone along with it

12
47
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:30,934
I would have given you half of the money.

13
51
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:33,285
You should've been wiser.

14
55
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:35,689
What do you mean?

15
59
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,432
The moment you rejected my proposal...

16
63
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:42,481
the goal of the game became just one thing : Goo Joon Pyo

17
67
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:45,955
Why are you doing this to Goo Joon Pyo?

18
71
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:47,152
Why?

19
75
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:51,127
Everyone here...

20
79
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:54,523
must have at least a few reasons for wanting revenge on Goo Joon Pyo.

21
83
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:57,902
You want to hear them all?

22
87
00:01:57,902 --> 00:02:00,086
Tell me the truth.

23
91
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,151
Why you are doing this to Goo Joon Pyo,

24
95
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:04,241
and what wrong has Goo Joon Pyo ever done to you?

25
99
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,573
Tell me.

26
103
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,321
To be exact,

27
107
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:13,540
he wronged my older brother . . .

28
111
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,649
Your brother?

29
115
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:26,340
Do you remember?

30
119
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:28,873
To my sweet brother

31
123
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:32,949
who was warmer to his despised half-brother than his own father.

32
127
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,304
Jan Di Sunbae.

33
131
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,387
Look at me closely.

34
135
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,227
Don't I . . .

35
139
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:47,734
remind you of someone?

36
143
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:56,642
This is not a school...

37
147
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,497
It's hell.

38
151
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:03,930
No!!

39
155
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:06,181
No.

40
159
00:03:09,586 --> 00:03:10,774
Do you mean the person

41
163
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,267
from the rooftop?

42
167
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:15,412
Bingo.

43
171
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:19,264
I will say hello to my brother for you.

44
175
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:23,052
He almost died.

45
179
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:26,082
But he always smiles when he talks about you.

46
183
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:28,199
You!

47
187
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:42,487
That's right.

48
191
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:45,204
I wanted revenge.

49
195
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,973
But . . .

50
199
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:51,134
As I got closer to you . . .

51
203
00:03:52,423 --> 00:03:56,358
if you chose to be with me, revenge wouldn't matter anymore . . .

52
207
00:03:58,263 --> 00:03:59,650
I thought that.

53
211
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:03,176
I truly thought that , but . . .

54
215
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:05,893
Hurry and go in!

55
219
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:08,506
Jan Di! 
 Geum Jan Di, are you okay?

56
224
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:09,574
Quiet!

57
228
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:12,776
Goo Joon Pyo!

58
232
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:14,111
Goo Joon Pyo!

59
236
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:21,986
Geum Jan Di ...

60
240
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:23,054
Are you okay?

61
244
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,388
You're not hurt, right?

62
248
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:25,756
Goo Joon Pyo!

63
252
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:27,158
Why did you come?

64
256
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:28,827
What is it that you thought you could accomplish?

65
260
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:30,094
Did you make sure?

66
264
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:32,029
Yeah, he definitely came alone.

67
268
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:34,666
Stupid bastard. Today's your unlucky day.

68
272
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:37,468
Let the girl go first.

69
276
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:39,737
It seems you plan on acting cool to the very end.

70
280
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,273
That won't do.

71
284
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:46,077
I'll make sure you're beaten to a bloody pulp. You won't be able to move even a finger.

72
288
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:50,615
We must make sure your princess sees you in such a sorry state.

73
292
00:04:51,182 --> 00:04:52,683
Don't you think so?

74
296
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,819
You guys can begin.

75
300
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,261
Goo Joon Pyo!

76
304
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,463
Goo Joon Pyo...

77
308
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:08,733
Goo Joon Pyo!

78
312
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,281
Stop it!

79
316
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:17,408
Ah! Goo Joon Pyo!

80
320
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,646
Don't do this! Stop!

81
324
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:25,049
Please save him! Please save him!

82
328
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:28,753
Goo Joon Pyo!

83
332
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,154
Stop.

84
336
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:43,901
Does it hurt?

85
340
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:49,207
Now, beg me to save your life.

86
344
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,877
Get on your knees and beg.

87
348
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:55,680
Then I'll let the girl go.

88
352
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,355
No! Goo Joon Pyo!

89
356
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:05,590
Don't!

90
360
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,725
Don't do it!

91
364
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:29,580
Goo Joon Pyo.

92
368
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,550
Stop!!!

93
372
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:51,736
Now say you'll give up Jan Di.

94
376
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:56,540
Hurry up and say it!

95
380
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:01,112
I don't think I can do that.

96
384
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,881
What?

97
388
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:05,916
Are you deaf?

98
392
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:09,120
I said I can't do that.

99
396
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,821
Do you want to die?

100
400
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:13,057
I don't want to die, but...

101
404
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,360
if you're going to kill me, I have no choice.

102
408
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:19,864
Say it!

103
412
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,035
Hurry up and say it!

104
416
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:40,551
Geum Jan Di.

105
420
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:51,996
Geum Jan Di.

106
424
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:55,466
-Jan Di!
-Goo Joon Pyo!

107
429
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:56,467
Geum Jan Di!

108
433
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:57,868
Goo Joon Pyo!

109
437
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:00,638
Go check outside.

110
441
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:39,910
Are you guys okay?

111
445
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:49,920
Geum Jan Di.

112
449
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:52,389
Geum Jan Di.

113
453
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:05,936
Geum Jan Di.

114
457
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:07,671
Are you conscious?

115
461
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:17,181
Goo Joon Pyo . . .

116
465
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,183
Hey, stupid.

117
469
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,484
I thought I was going to die of shock because of you!

118
473
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:23,254
Isn't that what I should be saying?

119
477
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:25,189
Aren't you the stupid one?

120
481
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:30,828
Why did you just let them hit you like that? 
Didn't you say you could beat up anyone even if it was 10 to one?

121
486
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:34,098
You are a complete braggart.

122
490
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:39,203
You stupid, idiot, with an IQ of two digits. You're so slow witted.

123
494
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,404
What?

124
498
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,973
They had you tied up, what was I supposed to do?

125
502
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:51,081
I'd rather get the crap kicked out of me than watch them hurt even a finger on your body.

126
506
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:53,751
But...

127
510
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:59,423
Because of that I was getting beaten to death on purpose, so why did you interfere?

128
514
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:01,559
What if something really bad happened?

129
518
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,429
It doesn't matter what the situation is, you always act so nosy.

130
522
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:13,304
You stupid, idiot, with an IQ of two digits. You're so slow witted.

131
526
00:10:13,304 --> 00:10:14,939
What?
-Hey!

132
531
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:20,344
Do you always hit patients?

133
535
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:23,447
Do you always hit women?

134
539
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:26,850
I'm really hurt.
  I'm really hurt too.

135
544
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,253
How can you say that with that look on your face?

136
548
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:32,256
You always..

137
552
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,358
Who do you think you're hitting?!

138
556
00:10:36,493 --> 00:10:37,661
I'm home..

139
560
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:53,777
What is it?

140
564
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:58,482
What happened?

141
568
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:00,684
What is all of this?

142
572
00:11:00,684 --> 00:11:04,922
Hey, Kang San, don't cry and tell me. What happened?

143
576
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:10,127
Father has been taken by the loan shark.

144
580
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:11,773
What?

145
584
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:14,337
Oh, Jan Di.

146
588
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:19,195
What should we do? What will happen if they kill your father?

147
592
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:24,919
They say if we can't pay them back, they'll sell everything whether it be a liver or kidney.

148
596
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:30,258
What are we going to do if they kill your father?

149
600
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:38,465
Oh, how are we supposed to survive.

150
604
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,675
For what did you come?

151
608
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:51,779
Ah, yes. I came to see the President.

152
612
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:55,516
Please come this way.

153
616
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,197
President.

154
620
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,574
Is there something wrong?

155
624
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,843
Help me.

156
628
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:25,012
What are you talking about?

157
632
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:26,814
The offer you presented us with last time.

158
636
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:33,721
Wait no, even half of half of your previous offer is good. Please, save my family.

159
640
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:37,861
No matter how much I think this through the only person I can think of who can help us is you.

160
644
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:40,463
So even though it may be considered inappropriate and difficult I came to see you.

161
648
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:45,666
Well it doesn't seem like it is too difficult for me.

162
652
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:50,538
But there is an order to everything.

163
656
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,006
Order?

164
660
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,812
If you commit a wrong, an apology should be first.

165
664
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:58,396
Whatever needs to be repaid should be repaid.  Whoever needs help then should be helped.

166
668
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:06,087
Because I am a business woman I hate anything that is calculated incorrectly or out of order.

167
672
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:11,792
Ah, yes of course that is how it should be.

168
676
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:27,041
Last time I committed a deadly sin.
Not knowing my station in life I dared to insult you.
I sincerely apologize.  Please forgive me.

169
682
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:55,602
You shouldn't do that.

170
686
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:58,806
Please, forgive me

171
690
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:09,983
I was the one who did wrong, please forgive me

172
694
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:13,988
Save my family, please forgive me...

173
698
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,366
Thank you.

174
702
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:03,668
Thank you.

175
706
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,813
I'm home...

176
710
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:15,449
Dad!!!

177
714
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,250
Dad!!

178
718
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,986
Oh, my Jan Di.

179
722
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,055
Are you okay? Nothing's wrong right?

180
726
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:23,758
Of course! I'm okay..

181
730
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:28,562
That's good. Do you know how much I was worried about you?

182
734
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:43,077
What's wrong with everyone? Dad came home... Did something happen?

183
738
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:58,392
-That...could that be...
 -It's not "could that be," it's definitely it.

184
743
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,526
Mom!

185
747
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:05,933
What did you want me to do? Did you want me to let your father die? 
All this money here, where else would it be from?

186
752
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:09,838
That money, go return it!

187
756
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:12,039
What..? 
Go Return it now!

188
761
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,208
No, I can't!

189
765
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:21,185
Do you know what I did to get this?
And if I return it, how are you gonna face the music?

190
770
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:24,819
I'll do it. It's what I did so I will face the music.

191
774
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:27,955
I'll use whatever means possible to repay them.

192
778
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:29,927
Jan Di, take the money, and return it.

193
782
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:31,793
What are you going to do? How?!

194
786
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:34,162
Just take it back!

195
790
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:37,264
If you don't then...

196
794
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:38,732
you better watch out!

197
798
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,694
It's cold.

198
802
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,064
You didn't even wear a jacket

199
806
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,233
Here

200
810
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:15,269
Hurry

201
814
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:23,978
Jan Di...

202
818
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,346
Yes?

203
822
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,615
You...

204
826
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:31,318
really like Joon Pyo right?

205
830
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,594
answer me...

206
834
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:46,500
To me, you're more important.

207
838
00:17:51,472 --> 00:17:52,573
I'm sorry.

208
842
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,714
to my daughter's beautiful love,

209
846
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,850
I'm only a burden.

210
850
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:06,520
Love, who said I loved him?

211
854
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,088
Dad...

212
858
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,792
It is love...

213
862
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,896
That's love, Jan Di.

214
866
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:25,339
He means to you as much as you compare with your dad.

215
870
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:30,277
I'm not even sure... how would you know?

216
874
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:36,116
I've been your father for 19 years and you think I wouldn't know that?

217
878
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,438
President.

218
882
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,874
Geum Jan Di is here to see you.

219
886
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,478
Really?

220
890
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,789
Come in, what's your business here?

221
894
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:21,128
I came here to return the money.

222
898
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:40,446
I heard that your family is going through a tough time. Wouldn't it be wiser that you pocket useless pride?

223
902
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:45,485
It's not pride but the conclusion my family came to.

224
906
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:48,656
Please excuse me for everything that happened.

225
910
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,095
If it wasn't enough, I can give you more

226
914
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:58,632
I've been watching you and I think you're pretty good at making deals.

227
918
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:01,368
Fine, let's make a deal.

228
922
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:10,911
Please do not insult me and my family anymore.
I beg you.

229
927
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,814
What?

230
931
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:17,919
So, are you really thinking of going out with my Joon Pyo?

231
935
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,590
That's a problem between me and Joon Pyo.

232
939
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:37,170
Fine, but let's be serious now,

233
943
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:43,544
I admit that I made things tough for your family.

234
947
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:50,651
Please accept the fact that you and Joon Pyo are not meant to be together.

235
951
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,387
Okay

236
955
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:59,860
Yeah. Joon Pyo and I are very different. I understand that.

237
959
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:05,132
But, do you know

238
963
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:12,806
we're surrounded by the same things and standing in the same place.

239
967
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:23,250
I made a promise with Goo Joon Pyo. That we wouldn't use you as an excuse to break up.

240
971
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:37,831
This money... was given to your family because your mother kneeled before me and begged.

241
975
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:43,202
Are you going to throw it all away just because of your childish pride?

242
979
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:48,597
Pride aside, this is an amazing offer.

243
983
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:50,479
Are you sure you won't regret this?

244
987
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,416
I didn't know you could put a price on pride.

245
991
00:21:55,416 --> 00:22:01,012
Then, how much is your pride?

246
995
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:03,783
You are too spunky.

247
999
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:10,414
It'd be great if you could change your opinion on the notion that a commoner's pride can be sold.

248
1003
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:14,486
And, a person's heart is not something you can buy with money.

249
1007
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:18,430
You didn't know that, did you?

250
1011
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:23,200
But...

251
1015
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,437
Now Goo Joon Pyo knows it.

252
1019
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:29,808
I have to go

253
1023
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:10,515
It's kind of funny isn't it?

254
1027
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:17,522
Goo Joon Pyo is all fussy after losing his girl and imagine his shock finding out it was his mother 
who paid for the whole thing.

255
1032
00:23:26,297 --> 00:23:27,699
You called 119 didn't you?

256
1036
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:35,907
I came to put out the fire.

257
1040
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:08,473
It's a pancake.

258
1044
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:15,845
You need to mix flour, milk, and, of course, baking powder, just like bindaedduk.

259
1048
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,398
Eh?

260
1052
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,303
This is the best cure when you're on the verge of crying.

261
1056
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,001
Thank you. It was delicious.

262
1060
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:12,871
Then, should we get going? 
 To where?

263
1065
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,582
Hey, straighten your legs.

264
1069
00:25:58,216 --> 00:25:59,951
Yeah, like that.

265
1073
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:02,253
Hey! You idiot!

266
1077
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:04,627
Buzz off!

267
1081
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:20,205
Yes....yes....
 ahhh.........

268
1086
00:26:23,441 --> 00:26:24,876
Ah, you idiot!

269
1090
00:26:26,778 --> 00:26:33,451
F4 ! It is F4 
 Ah...isn't that Geum Jan Di?

270
1095
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:35,823
Argh...

271
1099
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:38,623
Let's... hurry and tell Ginger!

272
1103
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:45,830
What is that?

273
1107
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:49,200
Nothing, it's nothing.

274
1111
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,169
What do you mean nothing?

275
1115
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:52,871
Hey...

276
1119
00:26:53,672 --> 00:26:57,508
Just looking at this, it feels like a proposal is coming.

277
1123
00:26:57,508 --> 00:27:03,216
What proposal? She keeps getting into trouble, so I thought I'd give her a leash.

278
1127
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:05,183
Is Geum Jan Di your pet?

279
1131
00:27:05,183 --> 00:27:10,017
With your personality, giving this to Jan Di worries me.

280
1135
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:13,760
Geum Jan Di's not the type to quietly accept something like a leash.

281
1139
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,301
I think you'll get beat up again.

282
1143
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:22,767
Jan Di's lethal spin kick? I think I might want to see that.

283
1147
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:26,705
Why are you guys making such a fuss? So annoying...

284
1151
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:32,003
Pay up.

285
1155
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:39,543
I came to turn pages in your music book...but you don't have one.

286
1159
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:42,147
Instead, would you like to run an errand for me?

287
1163
00:28:50,297 --> 00:28:53,925
Hey, Yoon Ji Hoo. How can you call me out here just tp leave me out in the cold?

288
1167
00:28:56,595 --> 00:28:57,496
Goo Joon Pyo?

289
1171
00:28:58,897 --> 00:28:59,731
Geum Jan Di.

290
1175
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,081
Here.

291
1179
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,569
It's cold. Wear this.

292
1183
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,048
You, put your hands deep in here and stay still.

293
1187
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,387
There's something in here.

294
1191
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:02,026
What is this?

295
1195
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:07,131
Can't you tell just by looking at it? It's a necklace.

296
1199
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:15,473
Hey, this can't be right. I know your style is a bit strange, but this is a girl's necklace!

297
1203
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:18,843
Idiot..

298
1207
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:23,981
It's for you.

299
1211
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:26,284
What? 
 I said it's for you.

300
1216
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:35,560
There's only one of these in the entire world, so if you lose it this time, you're really dead.

301
1220
00:30:37,762 --> 00:30:39,131
Only one?

302
1224
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:41,699
Yes.

303
1228
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:44,569
There's really only one?

304
1232
00:30:46,904 --> 00:30:49,374
I designed it myself and had it made.

305
1236
00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:52,043
Look here.

306
1240
00:30:55,346 --> 00:30:58,649
This is me, and the one inside is you.

307
1244
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:02,452
How?

308
1248
00:31:02,452 --> 00:31:06,423
How is it that you're the star and I'm the moon?

309
1252
00:31:06,423 --> 00:31:13,627
Because the moon - Geum Jan Di -, can never leave the star - Goo Joon Pyo -.

310
1256
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:24,409
No matter what happens, I'll never let go of this moon.

311
1260
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:45,929
See, you catch colds when you do things you don't usually do

312
1264
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,566
I didn't catch a cold, I just coughed, okay?

313
1268
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,700
It's cold.

314
1272
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:21,310
Look over there.

315
1276
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,300
That star is so bright..

316
1280
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:28,807
Are you sure? Isn't that a satellite?

317
1284
00:32:36,374 --> 00:32:40,500
It's pretty. It really is the only one of its kind.

318
1288
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:47,300
Don't you think it's romantic? 
 What do you mean romantic?

319
1293
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:48,225
Whenever I hear that, I feel so burdensome.

320
1297
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:54,267
- I'm already afraid what will happen if I lose it. 
- You seem pretty happy to me.

321
1302
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:55,033
What?

322
1306
00:32:55,033 --> 00:33:04,565
I think it'd be so nice if someone made and gave me a one of a kind keepsake, 
even if it is just a piece of glass.

323
1311
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:17,856
Let's go!

324
1315
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:21,025
- Where?
- Where else? Skiing.

325
1320
00:33:22,427 --> 00:33:23,138
Let's go.

326
1324
00:33:27,971 --> 00:33:30,648
Oh...My...God...

327
1328
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:34,972
What did she just say? 
 A one of a kind necklace?

328
1333
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,608
She got it from Joon Pyo!

329
1337
00:33:37,608 --> 00:33:41,275
Stay calm. I just can't stay calm for something like this!

330
1341
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:46,151
You guys... do you think she has the right to get something like that?

331
1345
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:47,618
No!

332
1349
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:50,654
It's not because it wasn't me that I'm saying this.

333
1353
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,024
Geum Jan Di is just so unacceptable, isn't she?

334
1357
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:54,291
Yes!

335
1361
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:58,963
You guys, let's go.

336
1365
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,869
Geum Jan Di, you're dead.

337
1369
00:34:06,238 --> 00:34:08,306
Ouch! My belly hurts.

338
1373
00:34:45,343 --> 00:34:48,212
Jan Di, are you okay?

339
1377
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:49,614
You go on ahead!

340
1381
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,629
Oh....Geum Jan Di

341
1385
00:35:08,629 --> 00:35:10,701
I didn't know it was you.

342
1389
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:13,237
- Sorry! 
 - It's ok.

343
1394
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,404
Are you okay?

344
1398
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:20,812
Yeah, I'm okay. 
 You should be careful.

345
1403
00:35:20,812 --> 00:35:27,507
You should be more careful. Uh, oh.

346
1407
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:28,853
Be careful!

347
1411
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:32,056
Are you okay? You should be careful.

348
1415
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:37,068
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Okay, get up.

349
1420
00:35:39,997 --> 00:35:42,734
- Are you ok? 
 - Huh, I'm fine.

350
1425
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,841
- It's ok, go. 
 - See you!

351
1430
00:35:52,209 --> 00:35:54,012
Jan Di! Are you ok?

352
1434
00:35:54,012 --> 00:35:55,947
Yeah, I'm fine!

353
1438
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:57,582
And you, are you ok?

354
1442
00:36:06,952 --> 00:36:09,042
Ga Eul! Ga Eul be careful!

355
1446
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:31,248
Ga Eul, are you ok?

356
1450
00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:33,484
Wake up! Can you hear me?

357
1454
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:36,455
Ga Eul!

358
1458
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:39,323
Ga Eul.

359
1462
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:42,693
Are you ok?

360
1466
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:50,535
Yeah, honey, about that...

361
1470
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,239
Okay, I'll take responsibility.

362
1474
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:57,408
So you shouldn't say anything.

363
1478
00:36:58,576 --> 00:37:05,049
The important thing right now is neither you nor me. How can you just throw away Shin Hwa like that ?

364
1482
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:10,021
You know how your father ... Honey! Honey?

365
1486
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:17,962
President.

366
1490
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:21,666
Our condition isn't good.

367
1494
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:28,572
Joon Pyo...find Joon Pyo first.

368
1498
00:37:28,572 --> 00:37:31,108
I need him so we can hurry and leave.

369
1502
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:32,243
I understand.

370
1506
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:43,721
Here, try this chocolate.

371
1510
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:52,429
Jan Di, where's your necklace?

372
1514
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:53,931
Necklace? It's here...

373
1518
00:37:56,344 --> 00:37:57,235
My necklace!

374
1522
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:03,474
But, where is it?

375
1526
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:14,685
What do you guys want?

376
1530
00:38:14,685 --> 00:38:19,190
Did you by any chance give Jan Di a necklace?

377
1534
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,624
How did you guys know that?

378
1538
00:38:20,624 --> 00:38:25,596
Doesn't it have a moon inside a star? 
 I'm asking you how you know that!

379
1543
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:29,033
You should ask Jan Di if she still has it.

380
1547
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:30,301
What?

381
1551
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:35,139
Whether she dropped it or threw it away, she may have lost it on the mountain.

382
1555
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:41,311
How could she lose something so important so easily?

383
1559
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:47,485
One thing about a person can say a lot about the rest of her. She thinks nothing of Sunbae... Ah!

384
1563
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,291
Yes! You're dead now.

385
1567
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:30,528
Did you lose something?

386
1571
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:33,297
Huh?

387
1575
00:39:38,804 --> 00:39:41,905
I was just cleaning the room.

388
1579
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:44,909
The necklace, why aren't you wearing it?

389
1583
00:39:46,986 --> 00:39:47,945
The necklace, it's . . .

390
1587
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,316
Goo Joon Pyo, I did something wrong!

391
1591
00:39:53,316 --> 00:39:58,122
I was wearing your necklace, but I don't know when it disappeared. I really don't know.

392
1595
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:02,927
It's not because you wanted to lose it?

393
1599
00:40:04,553 --> 00:40:05,196
Huh?

394
1603
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:14,872
You're always like this. If you truly knew my heart, you wouldn't step all over it.

395
1607
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:18,943
Am I really that insignificant to you?

396
1611
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:24,815
Goo Joon Pyo, don't misunderstand.

397
1615
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:31,956
It's really not like that. 
 You really make it difficult for a person.

398
1620
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:32,884
Blockhead!

399
1624
00:41:32,884 --> 00:41:36,655
Idiot!

400
1628
00:41:36,655 --> 00:41:39,523
Fool!

401
1632
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:50,568
Hey, Geum Jan Di, do you even know how much that necklace is worth?  I told you there's only one.

402
1636
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:57,041
What is this? 
 The president asked us to come get you.

403
1641
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:58,042
Please hurry.

404
1645
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:01,545
I don't want to.

405
1649
00:42:01,545 --> 00:42:03,752
Young master, the President said...

406
1653
00:42:03,752 --> 00:42:07,920
Like I said, I don't care what that witch said. I'm still not going. Tell her that.

407
1657
00:42:12,557 --> 00:42:16,894
Let go.  Aren't you going to let go? 
 We're sorry.

408
1662
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:26,303
Young master, the President... 
 I said,  I'm not going!

409
1667
00:42:33,444 --> 00:42:34,345
I'm not going.

410
1671
00:42:45,152 --> 00:42:46,590
Let go!

411
1675
00:42:58,914 --> 00:43:05,524
Due to a fierce blizzard in Kangwon Province, all traffic has come to a halt.

412
1679
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:15,267
-There's a big problem..
 -Ga Eul, what's wrong?

413
1684
00:43:15,267 --> 00:43:19,371
Jan Di... Jan Di, at the mountain...

414
1688
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:25,977
I'm going to find the necklace. I'll be right back.

415
1692
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:27,312
Necklace?

416
1696
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:28,914
Where's Joon Pyo now?

417
1700
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,900
I'm cramped.

418
1704
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,763
Yeah?

419
1708
00:43:46,763 --> 00:43:48,801
Yeah, something annoying came up ...

420
1712
00:43:51,177 --> 00:43:52,170
What?

421
1716
00:43:58,409 --> 00:43:59,711
Find a bathroom.

422
1720
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:25,837
Geum Jan Di!

423
1724
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:29,708
Did you by any chance lose your star necklace?

424
1728
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:34,580
-How did you know?
 -Oh... So it was yours.

425
1733
00:44:36,055 --> 00:44:39,850
Should we tell you where you can find it?

426
1737
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:43,372
Someone posted a memo that they found a necklace at the top of the mountain

427
1741
00:44:43,372 --> 00:44:45,787
and left it at the hilltop cafe for safe keeping.

428
1745
00:44:45,787 --> 00:44:47,926
Go see
 REALLY?

429
1750
00:44:49,582 --> 00:44:51,693
Where do I need to go? This way?

430
1754
00:44:53,078 --> 00:44:53,999
Thanks!

431
1758
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,655
What do we do?

432
1762
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,604
The weather outside keeps getting worse.

433
1766
00:45:54,479 --> 00:46:01,065
Something bad won't really happen to her, right? 
 What do you mean? Nothing's going to happen.

434
1771
00:46:01,065 --> 00:46:03,569
She brought that on herself.

435
1775
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:11,035
She's a humble commoner. How dare she take Joon Pyo Sunbae's one-of-a kind token?

436
1779
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:18,062
You're right. If that commoner knew her place, we wouldn't have to go to such lengths.

437
1783
00:46:18,062 --> 00:46:19,317
Such lengths? For what?

438
1787
00:46:20,157 --> 00:46:22,154
Oh my god! Ji Hoo Sunbae!

439
1791
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:32,369
What did you guys do to Jan Di?

440
1795
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,547
Are you going to follow me into the bathroom?

441
1799
00:47:13,068 --> 00:47:14,348
He's taking too long, don't you think?

442
1803
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:34,959
Jandi said she wanted to find the necklace and went up the mountain alone.

443
1807
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:40,265
Goo Joon Pyo, can you hear me? I think Geum Jan Di may have been duped.

444
1811
00:47:53,419 --> 00:47:55,491
Pull over!

445
1815
00:48:25,876 --> 00:48:30,682
There's only one of these in the world, so if you lose it this time, you're really dead.

446
1819
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:37,389
Only one? 
 This is me and the one in the middle is you.

447
1824
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,625
How?

448
1828
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:44,162
How is it that you're the star and I'm the moon?

449
1832
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:52,304
Because Geum Jan Di, the moon can never leave Goo Joon Pyo, the star.

450
1836
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:33,712
Geum Jan Di, don't worry. I won't ever leave you alone.

451
1840
00:49:52,398 --> 00:49:53,498
Geum Jan Di!

452
1844
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,668
Jan Di!

453
1848
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:03,074
Jan Di! Answer me! Geum Jan Di!

454
1852
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:10,415
Jan Di!

455
1856
00:50:12,818 --> 00:50:14,018
Hey, Geum Jan Di!

456
1860
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:15,920
Hey!

457
1864
00:50:18,923 --> 00:50:21,960
Geum Jan Di, wake up!

458
1868
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,729
Jan Di.

459
1872
00:50:25,729 --> 00:50:29,435
-Goo Junpyo. 
 -That's right, it's me, Goo Joon Pyo.

460
1877
00:50:29,435 --> 00:50:31,808
Are you okay now?

461
1881
00:50:31,808 --> 00:50:39,848
I came to find your heart. 
I didn't lose it on purpose. 
Hey, stupid. Who told you to do this kind of stupid thing?

462
1887
00:50:39,848 --> 00:50:43,248
Hey, idiot. Who told you to do that?

463
1891
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,385
Do you think you can get up?

464
1895
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:51,523
Get on my back.

465
1899
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:05,603
Jan Di, can you hear me?

466
1903
00:51:05,603 --> 00:51:07,338
Hey, you can't let yourself fade out!

467
1907
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,441
Hey, Geum Jan Di!

468
1911
00:51:27,057 --> 00:51:28,994
Because of the blizzard, they said it'd be hard to find her.

469
1915
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:39,637
Ji Hoo, where are you going? 
 I can't just leave her out there like this.

470
1920
00:51:39,637 --> 00:51:40,638
Are you going to cause even more trouble?

471
1924
00:51:40,638 --> 00:51:43,875
They can't even send out a search party.
Geum Jan Di...

472
1929
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,878
Jan Di is out there.

473
1933
00:51:47,812 --> 00:51:50,214
She's out there in the snow by herself.

474
1937
00:51:50,214 --> 00:51:51,182
Let me go.

475
1941
00:51:51,182 --> 00:51:53,785
- Ji Hoo...
- Calm down.

476
1946
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:19,277
Jan Di, are you ok?

477
1950
00:52:20,445 --> 00:52:22,647
Oi, Geum Jan Di ?

478
1954
00:52:35,459 --> 00:52:37,762
Jan Di, are you okay?

479
1958
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:41,032
Geum Jan Di? Geum Jan Di ?

480
1962
00:52:56,879 --> 00:53:00,018
What are you doing? 
 You need to take these off.

481
1967
00:53:00,919 --> 00:53:01,987
Is it dirty?

482
1971
00:53:01,987 --> 00:53:03,588
Take it all off.

483
1975
00:53:03,588 --> 00:53:07,191
Joon Pyo. 
 Otherwise, you'll die.

484
1980
00:53:07,191 --> 00:53:08,760
Do you really want to freeze to death out of sheer stubborness?

485
1984
00:53:10,861 --> 00:53:14,499
It won't matter even if you resist because. I'm not going to let you just die like this.

486
1988
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:24,305
Don't worry. It's ok. It's going to be ok.

487
1992
00:53:24,807 --> 00:53:26,441
I'll protect you.

488
1996
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:03,419
Hurry.

489
2000
00:54:21,397 --> 00:54:24,465
I'm sorry.
 If you know you're sorry that's enough.

490
2005
00:54:26,353 --> 00:54:29,770
Don't forget that I saved your life this time.

491
2009
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:37,311
How can I pay you back?
 Lunch box...

492
2014
00:54:38,145 --> 00:54:38,679
Hm?

493
2018
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:41,048
You know, that stuff you eat every day...

494
2022
00:54:45,162 --> 00:54:47,421
Fried egg? (rolled up like an omelette log)

495
2026
00:54:47,421 --> 00:54:48,656
Yeah that.

496
2030
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:59,300
To be honest... 
I wanted to try it the first time I saw you eating it.

497
2035
00:55:05,003 --> 00:55:05,706
Why are you laughing?

498
2039
00:55:08,507 --> 00:55:12,113
I'm wondering if this is the same Goo Joon Pyo that I know.

499
2043
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:15,149
Are you making fun of me right now?

500
2047
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,958
I'll make it for you.

501
2051
00:55:27,928 --> 00:55:34,064
Let's pack a lunch and go on a picnic. 
Just the two of us.

502
2056
00:56:25,221 --> 00:56:27,821
Jan Di!
Joon Pyo!

503
2061
00:56:31,692 --> 00:56:35,395
Joon Pyo, are you okay?
 Are you guys okay?

504
2066
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:36,964
Yeah, we're fine.

505
2070
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:44,217
The attorney general's office has opened an investigation on Shin Hwa-gate, and word has it that Beijing-based Chairman Goo is in serious condition.

506
2074
00:59:44,217 --> 00:59:52,261
According to an official spokesperson from Shin Hwa Group,

507
2078
00:59:52,261 --> 00:59:54,512
Chairman Goo collapsed from shock and he was taken to a hospital in Beijing.

508
2082
00:59:59,199 --> 00:59:59,933
Hello?

509
2086
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:09,076
- Sunbae! 
 - Hurry and get on!

510
2091
01:00:09,076 --> 01:00:11,245
Why? What's going on?

511
2095
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:12,613
It's urgent.

512
2099
01:00:13,914 --> 01:00:14,782
What?

513
2103
01:00:14,782 --> 01:00:17,350
We have to hurry if you want to see Joon Pyo.

514
2107
01:00:20,086 --> 01:00:21,088
Sunbae.

515
2111
01:00:38,717 --> 01:00:40,624
Everything is ready.

516
2115
01:00:43,076 --> 01:00:44,044
President. We shall go now.

517
2119
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:04,642
Joon Pyo's dad... collapsed.
 What!

518
2124
01:01:04,642 --> 01:01:07,334
The plane is leaving in 30 minutes.

519
2128
01:01:55,814 --> 01:02:00,420
I... didn't even get to say thank you or goodbye

520
2132
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:05,592
I didn't even get to tell him how I felt about him.

521
2136
01:02:44,362 --> 01:02:49,036
I'll return no matter what. Just stay there and wait for me.

522
2140
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:52,638
I love you,

523
2144
01:02:52,638 --> 01:02:54,141
Geum Jan Di.
