1
3
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,713
Grandpa! Faster, faster!

2
7
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:43,622
Okay, I get it.

3
11
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:47,208
Mr. President, I'll do it instead.

4
15
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,267
It's a delight for this grandfather to be able to be a horse for his grandson.

5
19
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,507
Why are you trying to take that from me?

6
23
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:54,413
Ji Hoo, are you having fun?

7
27
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:55,762
Yes, grandpa.

8
31
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:58,910
Grandpa, can we go fishing?

9
35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,698
I'll catch a BIG shark.

10
39
00:02:02,698 --> 00:02:05,388
Fishing? Of course, we can.

11
43
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:07,292
When do you want to go?

12
47
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,418
Let's go now.

13
51
00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:10,587
Fine, let's go.

14
55
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,554
Oh, my boy...

15
59
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:57,751
Mr. President, do you like it that much?

16
63
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:00,259
If you become a grandfather,

17
67
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,022
you will know how it feels.

18
71
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:08,291
Hello.

19
75
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:13,076
What? Are you sure?

20
79
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:17,277
Don't hold anything back. Did you check?

21
83
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,453
-Mr. President...
- Yes?

22
88
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,287
<i>Due to talks of a possible merger between ShinHwa and JK Group</i>

23
92
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:49,225
<i>all stocks regarding ShinHwa Group  have been sky rocketing.</i>

24
96
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:54,972
<i>As people continue to watch closesly as these two groups economize their companies..
 they also watch as they plan to join theirs hands in-law</i>

25
101
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:59,060
Do you know what that means?

26
105
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,836
If our relationship with JK breaks tomorrow,

27
109
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,395
What do you think will happen?

28
113
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:09,505
We don't know whether our company's stock will crash by the morning.

29
117
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:14,745
This ShinHwa which your grandfather and father built with their blood and sweat.

30
121
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:17,028
If it collapses due to your foolish love-play,

31
125
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:19,066
then will you understand?

32
129
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:21,077
Stop it.

33
133
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:23,424
Joon Pyo, give us a moment.

34
137
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:25,269
I'm not finished talking.

35
141
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:27,140
Joon Pyo, starting tomorrow,

36
145
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,478
treat Jae Kyung like she's your fiancee, understand?

37
149
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,582
Aren't you going to answer me?

38
153
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,221
Aren't you going to give us a moment?

39
157
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,532
Was I not enough?

40
161
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,593
Don't butt in.

41
165
00:04:51,593 --> 00:04:53,573
When you needed a hotel, you sold your daughter.

42
169
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:56,068
When you need an investment, you sell your son.

43
173
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:59,164
What will you do if you need anything else?

44
177
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,153
You don't have any kids left.

45
181
00:05:01,153 --> 00:05:02,673
I do this all for you and Joon Pyo.

46
185
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:04,475
Who asked you to?

47
189
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:05,995
Who the hell told you,

48
193
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:08,228
that it's all for us?

49
197
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:10,109
I've never even saw you,

50
201
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:13,113
as someone that was there for us.

51
205
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:16,222
Who do you think gave you the happiness you're enjoying now?

52
209
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:17,476
Happiness?

53
213
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,308
Do you even know,

54
217
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:24,058
what happiness really is?

55
221
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:26,967
I don't have the luxury to listen, you don't know how lucky you are.

56
225
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:28,234
Joon Pyo . . .

57
229
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,128
Leave him alone.

58
233
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:32,391
I already said that this doesn't concern you!

59
237
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:33,567
This time...

60
241
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,440
I won't just sit back and watch you do this.

61
245
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:29,459
Sunbae!

62
249
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:30,644
Why are you here?

63
253
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:38,050
Suam Art Center
Concert Hall

64
258
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,751
Now you. What are you doing here at this hour?

65
262
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:50,236
I have a bit of a situation.

66
266
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:54,917
You're doing all of this yourself?

67
270
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:58,125
I'm in the process of doing it all.

68
274
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:23,242
What are you doing?

69
278
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:26,964
I already told you. I can do some cleaning too.

70
282
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,310
Thank you.

71
286
00:08:20,254 --> 00:08:21,142
Here you go.

72
290
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:27,333
I can't split the work money.

73
294
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:31,644
Instead, I'll pay you back with coffee and a drive.

74
298
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:33,701
Drive?

75
302
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:21,000
Jan Di... Jan Di...

76
306
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,735
Wake up! Can you hear me?

77
310
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,312
I'm OK.

78
314
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:27,601
Get on!

79
318
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:30,983
Get on!

80
322
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:45,861
It's exhaustion plus malnutrition.

81
326
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:47,607
If she just rests, she'll be fine.

82
330
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:49,401
Thank you.

83
334
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,803
I'll just do this and go.

84
338
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:40,237
I held back because you're my friend and she's your girl.

85
342
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:45,583
And I gave you chances up until the very end.

86
346
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,040
Now, I'm not going to hold back.

87
350
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:53,200
Why? Now that Jun Pyo's engaged, you're getting nervous?

88
354
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,133
So you planned to throw yourself at him?

89
358
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:58,437
- You detestable and audacious little.. 
- Stop it!

90
363
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:09,926
This is the company that your grandfather and father built with their blood and sweat.

91
367
00:14:09,926 --> 00:14:13,732
When you realize that you threw it all away for some love game, then will that set you straight?

92
371
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,507
Nuna, somebody is waiting for you at the playground.

93
375
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:25,468
What's wrong?

94
379
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,046
Jun Pyo...

95
383
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:31,476
Gu Jun Pyo...

96
387
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:35,969
Did something happen to Gu Joon Pyo?

97
391
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:42,813
He says he wants to go out for real.

98
395
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:54,424
I'm so happy. So happy that I thought I was going to go crazy.

99
399
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:56,867
I hurried all this way to tell you.

100
403
00:16:57,943 --> 00:17:01,442
You are... 
 going to congratulate me, right?

101
408
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:06,349
Congratulations.

102
412
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,888
Falling in love with one's fiance...

103
416
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,948
Don't you think it's so romantic?

104
420
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,598
Thank you.

105
424
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:29,964
I'm glad I have a friend to tell this to,

106
428
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:33,420
I'm so happy.

107
432
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:41,957
Hello.

108
436
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,255
Look, I got a matching phone as a present.

109
440
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,841
Let's go.

110
444
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:26,884
Please look this way.

111
448
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:31,041
Please look this way.

112
452
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:38,539
Is a wedding date set yet?

113
456
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,055
Look at them, they suit each other don't they?

114
460
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,111
Yes, you can say that.

115
464
00:19:57,111 --> 00:20:01,938
So little time has passed, and already JunPyo looks so dignified.

116
468
00:20:01,938 --> 00:20:07,090
JaeKyung, please be careful not to bring shame to JunPyo.

117
472
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:14,666
No, I'm sure she won't.
I think it's time

118
477
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,642
that the image of ShinHwa's future first lady changed, don't you?

119
481
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:21,771
Miss Jae Kyung, please stay as bright as you are.

120
485
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:24,662
Thank you.

121
489
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:27,570
Then, is it okay if we leave?

122
493
00:20:29,016 --> 00:20:30,587
Where do you plan to go?

123
497
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:33,487
It's our first date and you want to stalk us?

124
501
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,139
Fine.

125
505
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:40,318
I got it. 
Please take care of her, JoonPyo.

126
510
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:54,388
<i>Over there.</i>

127
514
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:04,637
<i>Shoot!</i>

128
518
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:08,060
How did a little kid like you learn to gamble?!

129
522
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:10,254
<i>I'm not playing! I'm not playing!</i>

130
526
00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:32,537
<i>Who's grandma?</i>

131
530
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:39,120
Hey, Joon.

132
534
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,273
Joon?  Do you think I'm a dog?

133
538
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:44,123
Ouch!

134
542
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,424
Hey! You . . .

135
546
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:45,290
What picture?

136
550
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:49,182
Ah, let go.

137
554
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:01,251
Buy this for me!

138
558
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:12,692
Let's Go Together!

139
562
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:18,727
No, I don't want to ride this.

140
566
00:23:20,904 --> 00:23:23,272
If you want to ride it, ride it yourself, you woman.

141
570
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:25,100
It's a date, why would I ride it by myself?

142
574
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:28,375
I see. Are you scared of heights?

143
578
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:32,937
You really are, aren't you?
 It really doesn't suit you.

144
583
00:23:33,665 --> 00:23:35,367
Who's scared of heights?

145
587
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:38,422
If you confess you don't need to ride it

146
591
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:42,002
As soon as you get on the cable car,
"AHH, SAVE ME!"

147
596
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:43,891
You're not going to be like that, are you??

148
600
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:45,998
Why does this monkey make me into some idiot?

149
604
00:23:45,998 --> 00:23:48,872
Fine!  Let's ride it.  I'll just ride it.

150
608
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:38,717
Is the studying going well??

151
612
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:41,904
If I get into medical school with all this studying,

152
616
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:44,072
then that would be a real miracle.

153
620
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,538
You're really good at miracles.

154
624
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:49,740
What?

155
628
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,677
Don't you remember?

156
632
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:54,260
Wondergirl,  Geum Jan Di.

157
636
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:03,481
Even if I don't get into medical school, I still want to help out at that grandpa's clinic...

158
640
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:29,760
Can't you make up with your grandpa?

159
644
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,895
We've never fought.

160
648
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:36,200
Because I'm the one who was thrown away.

161
652
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,858
It's not like that.

162
656
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,016
Your grandpa's also living with a lot of regret.

163
660
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:47,210
- And... 
- And?

164
665
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:56,927
He also misses you, Sunbae.

165
669
00:27:00,313 --> 00:27:01,156
What?

166
673
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,480
I always feel like

167
677
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,193
you understand things better than I do.

168
681
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,024
That person (Min Seo Hyun)

169
685
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:12,313
And grandpa as well.

170
689
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:16,963
I... just...

171
693
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:26,028
Are you really going to be like this?

172
697
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:27,882
It's always me asking.

173
701
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:31,487
And even when we're together, you never agree.

174
705
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:34,730
You really are being annoying.

175
709
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,043
If you're really that unsatisfied, you can stop chasing me around.

176
713
00:27:38,043 --> 00:27:40,160
It's because I feel anxious.

177
717
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:41,907
What?

178
721
00:27:47,353 --> 00:27:50,661
I keep feeling anxious.

179
725
00:27:56,346 --> 00:28:01,259
If you make me believe, if you make me certain,

180
729
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:03,278
I'll stop chasing after you.

181
733
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:06,087
I'll wait patiently.

182
737
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:08,738
What do you want me to do?

183
741
00:28:11,176 --> 00:28:12,630
Kiss me.

184
745
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:30,710
Hey, Joon. Let's go together.

185
749
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:15,118
Hey, Joon,  I said let's go together.

186
753
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:16,895
Hey, what is this again?

187
757
00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:19,585
It's annoying, so go over there.

188
761
00:30:20,773 --> 00:30:24,549
But there are 99 things I've alyways wanted to do once I got a boyfriend.

189
765
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:25,733
You're not already annoyed are you?

190
769
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:27,187
99 things?

191
773
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:30,400
I don't want to, so get another guy to do them with.

192
777
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,616
I'm busy.

193
781
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:35,546
Okay, then let's do just one a day.

194
785
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:40,274
Then, when we do all the 99 things, we'll reach our 100th day and become real lovers.

195
789
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:42,547
What 100th day?

196
793
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:44,349
You really plan on being together that long?

197
797
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:51,455
Then since today's our first day, can't we make it special and do 2 things?

198
801
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:59,922
Can you...
take me somewhere?

199
806
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,072
You probably were an otter during your last life.

200
810
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:23,106
Me?

201
814
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:25,331
You're similar.

202
818
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:31,198
You both are diligent, off-the-wall, cute,

203
822
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:33,332
and can't live without water.

204
826
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:41,927
Couldn't you just say something  like the little mermaid or something?

205
830
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,076
The Little Mermaid won't do.

206
834
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:49,319
Turning into bubbles because you can't forget your love...

207
838
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:51,853
is too sad, isn't it?

208
842
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:05,071
Seems like the otter is hungry?

209
846
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:11,157
Ah.  Let's go!

210
850
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,986
I'll buy dinner.

211
854
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:28,947
Monkey, why should I go to a place like this?  Go by yourself.

212
858
00:33:28,947 --> 00:33:32,408
Just try to eat at this place, it's really good.

213
862
00:33:32,408 --> 00:33:33,310
Joon Pyo.

214
866
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,052
Oh... it's Jan Di!

215
870
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:41,877
Jan Di, it's like we sense each other, right?

216
874
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:08,847
Hello, my name is Cha Eun Jae.

217
878
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:19,807
One moment...

218
882
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:23,812
Please come in.

219
886
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:27,043
Welcome! 
 I welcome you to the world of pottery.

220
891
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:18,204
Ah, thank you.

221
895
00:35:18,204 --> 00:35:19,889
The one who is grateful is me.

222
899
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,970
What?

223
903
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,283
Usually, older women like to come.

224
907
00:35:25,283 --> 00:35:29,162
I'm happy because someone young like you came.

225
911
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,237
How did you get interested in pottery?

226
915
00:35:35,906 --> 00:35:39,410
Someone I know does pottery.

227
919
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,152
Is that someone a person you like?

228
923
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,356
Huh?

229
927
00:35:44,356 --> 00:35:46,001
Because you want to get to know him

230
931
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:52,046
You want to learn so you can do it together. I know that feeling well.

231
935
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,029
Teacher, did you also...

232
939
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,197
We were childhood friends.

233
943
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:03,201
While other kids were playing house,
we learned to make pottery together.

234
948
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,297
Did your boyfriend also become a potter?

235
952
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:12,952
He's a potter.

236
956
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:17,358
But he didn't become my boyfriend.

237
960
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:22,304
Ah.
I don't need sympathy.

238
965
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:25,012
Thanks to it, I became even stronger.

239
969
00:36:29,963 --> 00:36:36,062
This piece here. Even though it looks weak on the outside, on the inside it's actually very strong.

240
973
00:36:38,361 --> 00:36:40,603
Turned upside down,and stepped on.

241
977
00:36:40,603 --> 00:36:44,081
After it's cut endlessly over and over again on the potter wheel, then . . .

242
981
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,094
1,300 graus

243
985
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,743
That's right!
After heating it in a kiln at 1,300 degrees

244
990
00:36:50,743 --> 00:36:54,668
You can make something with as strong a soul as this one.

245
994
00:36:54,668 --> 00:36:57,390
But, Ga Eul, how did you know that?

246
998
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,740
Ah, it's because I've heard it before.

247
1002
00:37:05,232 --> 00:37:07,802
To me, that friend was,

248
1006
00:37:07,802 --> 00:37:12,215
was my kiln and my potter's wheel.

249
1010
00:37:12,215 --> 00:37:15,141
Have you forgotten that person now?

250
1014
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:23,448
Gaeul, please bring your friend here sometime.

251
1018
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:24,885
I'm curious.

252
1022
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:15,136
This is my studio.

253
1026
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:17,521
Do your "job"

254
1030
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:18,906
Somewhere else.

255
1034
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:26,090
Son, don't you do the same thing?

256
1038
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,674
Why don't the two of us try to get along, okay?

257
1042
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,697
If you're going to be this way,

258
1046
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:37,401
I'll move to another studio.

259
1050
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:39,334
You can not do that.

260
1054
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:43,078
I'm the one that should leave.

261
1058
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:45,760
But you can't.

262
1062
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:53,282
Did you forget that the person to take on the "So" name

263
1066
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:55,477
is not me, but YiJung.

264
1070
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:58,202
You.

265
1074
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,270
I've never said I wanted to do that.

266
1078
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,887
You've never said you didn't want it either.

267
1082
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,411
Am I not correct?

268
1086
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,350
Why must you live like this?

269
1090
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:19,458
Because I'm bored.

270
1094
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,088
Living is so boring, son.

271
1098
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:28,644
Have you ever lived properly,

272
1102
00:39:29,092 --> 00:39:31,108
for even one second?

273
1106
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:36,960
The woman who makes me want to live right....

274
1110
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:41,466
came only once in my entire life.

275
1114
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:46,808
If you lose a woman like that....

276
1118
00:39:50,831 --> 00:39:52,659
every other woman is the same.

277
1122
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:58,537
It's just all meaningless repetition.

278
1126
00:40:00,183 --> 00:40:01,672
Don't you think that to mom....

279
1130
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:07,340
Don't you think that you're being too cruel to mom?

280
1134
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:14,184
That's why I wish this lifetime would go by faster.

281
1138
00:40:17,554 --> 00:40:19,592
It's just not working out the way I want it to.

282
1142
00:40:28,944 --> 00:40:32,966
Do you know why you passed Il-Hyun and became the head of our family?

283
1146
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:38,870
It's because you resemble me the most.

284
1150
00:40:41,195 --> 00:40:43,990
Cruel, don't you think?

285
1154
00:40:49,777 --> 00:40:53,499
Don't forget it. 
 Once in a lifetime.

286
1159
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:57,330
The real thing comes only once.

287
1163
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:02,903
That's just another cruel truth.

288
1167
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:45,535
Here's "kim-bap" for 2 people

289
1171
00:41:50,311 --> 00:41:54,212
Event! 50 Bowls of Free Coupons for ladies
who can eat our jumbo ramyun in 20 mins!

290
1176
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:04,473
Enjoy!

291
1180
00:42:04,473 --> 00:42:06,380
Excuse me.
Yes?

292
1185
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,126
Is that real?

293
1189
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,461
Yes.

294
1193
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,031
But it's pretty hard to accomplish.

295
1197
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,666
Do you want to try it?

296
1201
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,900
If you succeed, do you really get 50 coupons for free ramen noodles?

297
1205
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,437
of course!

298
1209
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:22,907
But...who is going to do it?

299
1213
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,797
Me!

300
1217
00:42:24,797 --> 00:42:27,078
Hey, monkey, what are you doing?

301
1221
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,914
Jan Di, you want to try too, right?

302
1225
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,679
All right.  I'll win it for you!

303
1229
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:41,425
No, don't.  Do you really think you'll be able to eat all that?

304
1233
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,899
What will you do if I win?

305
1237
00:42:42,899 --> 00:42:44,095
What?

306
1241
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,198
If I win...

307
1245
00:42:45,198 --> 00:42:47,166
you three have to grant my wish.

308
1249
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,601
- Wish? 
- Okay.  We'll grant it.

309
1254
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:54,505
All right!  Ready to meet the challenge!

310
1258
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:01,946
GO!

311
1262
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:45,206
5... 4... 3... 2....

312
1266
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:45,862
1!

313
1270
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:49,449
Success!

314
1274
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:15,554
Jan Di! For you.

315
1278
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:21,284
Now, you all have to grant my wish.

316
1282
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:23,827
What kind of wish?

317
1286
00:44:24,984 --> 00:44:26,261
Let's go on a trip!

318
1290
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,337
What?

319
1294
00:44:28,337 --> 00:44:29,388
The four of us,

320
1298
00:44:29,388 --> 00:44:31,577
Jan Di, Ji Hoo, Joon Pyo and I.

321
1302
00:44:31,577 --> 00:44:34,842
Two couples on a double date trip to our resort.

322
1306
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:39,535
Hey, monkey, I really hate double anything.

323
1310
00:44:39,535 --> 00:44:42,888
What do you mean?  You said you'd grant my wish.

324
1314
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:48,590
Jan Di, you will go, right?  Let's go!  Hmm, hmm?

325
1318
00:44:53,379 --> 00:44:54,695
What the heck are you, anyway?

326
1322
00:44:55,748 --> 00:44:58,164
How can a girl eat that all?

327
1326
00:44:58,164 --> 00:45:00,102
What a glutton!

328
1330
00:45:05,988 --> 00:45:08,906
Jan Di, let's go.  Hmm, hmm?

329
1334
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:11,152
Ji Hoo, let's go, hmm?

330
1338
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,768
Mom, please don't die!

331
1342
00:45:35,768 --> 00:45:37,222
Don't die.

332
1346
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,252
Found you.

333
1350
00:45:52,046 --> 00:45:57,022
- Do you think mom will die?
- She'll be fine.

334
1355
00:45:57,022 --> 00:46:01,464
- Yi Jung! So Yi Jung?  Where are you?
 - Il Hyun Oppa is calling you.

335
1360
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:45,287
How did you find me?

336
1364
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:49,846
Wherever you are, I just know where you are.

337
1368
00:47:49,846 --> 00:47:52,641
You can't leave until I fall asleep.

338
1372
00:48:29,597 --> 00:48:34,489
Can I . . . sleep?

339
1376
00:49:01,157 --> 00:49:15,657
Eun Jae, will you be able to find me again?

340
1380
00:49:15,657 --> 00:49:21,588
You were always the one who found me.

341
1384
00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:23,242
Good morning!

342
1388
00:50:24,376 --> 00:50:26,745
Hey Monkey, why are you here so early in the morning?

343
1392
00:50:27,947 --> 00:50:30,282
What kind of question is that to ask your fiancee?

344
1396
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:39,332
It's ok. I take it as a term of endearment, so I'm not bothered by it.

345
1400
00:50:39,332 --> 00:50:41,026
I'm used to it.

346
1404
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,743
You're making a perfectly fine person into an idiot.

347
1408
00:50:45,197 --> 00:50:48,630
This is why girls who are raised properly are different.

348
1412
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:53,931
That sweet heart of yours can't be bought with money or taught.

349
1416
00:50:53,931 --> 00:51:01,088
Not really. I have a friend who has a very hard life but she keeps working hard without any complaints.

350
1420
00:51:01,088 --> 00:51:02,708
Friend?

351
1424
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:04,863
Hey, Monkey!

352
1428
00:51:04,863 --> 00:51:08,298
Aren't you leaving?  If we leave late, we'll get stuck in traffic.

353
1432
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,905
I'm leaving!

354
1436
00:51:10,905 --> 00:51:12,569
Have a great time.

355
1440
00:51:17,096 --> 00:51:18,197
Over here.

356
1444
00:51:27,211 --> 00:51:28,177
Hello. How are you?

357
1448
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,734
Wait right here.

358
1452
00:51:40,803 --> 00:51:42,362
Tadah!

359
1456
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,743
What do you think?  Is it pretty? 
 Do you think Joon Pyo will like it?

360
1461
00:51:52,496 --> 00:51:55,654
Normally I find these things really cheesy.

361
1465
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,803
But I guess people really do change.

362
1469
00:51:57,803 --> 00:52:01,379
I keep wanting to brand him: "This man is mine."

363
1473
00:52:04,644 --> 00:52:09,503
- J and J? 
- Joon Pyo and Jae Kyung.

364
1478
00:52:10,383 --> 00:52:18,228
When I was getting this engraved, I felt really awkward. 
Is this man really my other half?

365
1483
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:26,404
J and J...right...

366
1487
00:53:32,066 --> 00:53:32,921
Are you guys finished?

367
1491
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:36,635
Let's see.

368
1495
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:54,253
It's awful.

369
1499
00:53:54,253 --> 00:53:57,389
Please prepare our dinner.

370
1503
00:53:57,389 --> 00:53:59,217
Yes, Barbeque.

371
1507
00:54:19,071 --> 00:54:20,325
Jandi, eat a lot.

372
1511
00:54:29,045 --> 00:54:30,800
Let's make a toast! 
 I already drank it all.

373
1516
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:54,821
Hey Jandi! Guem Jandi, are you OK?

374
1520
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:55,989
Wake up!

375
1524
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,064
Hey, Geum Jan Di,  are you ok?

376
1528
00:57:00,064 --> 00:57:01,213
Can you hear me?

377
1532
00:57:09,076 --> 00:57:10,017
Goo Joon Pyo,

378
1536
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:14,118
I thought you couldn't swim.

379
1540
00:57:16,716 --> 00:57:17,932
I can, now.

380
1544
00:57:22,869 --> 00:57:24,397
What happened?

381
1548
00:57:25,533 --> 00:57:26,369
I learned.

382
1552
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,008
Don't lift your head up. Turn it to the side.

383
1556
00:57:50,062 --> 00:57:56,589
I realized I would rather drown than to watch another guy save you. 
So I was able to learn.

384
1561
00:58:04,769 --> 00:58:07,408
What happened?  Jan Di, are you ok?

385
1565
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:09,445
She is ok.

386
1569
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:11,457
Thank god !

387
1573
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:16,002
I'll take care of her from here.

388
1577
00:58:16,394 --> 00:58:18,901
Yes. Take her so she can rest.

389
1581
00:58:54,914 --> 00:58:57,223
You, are you okay?

390
1585
00:58:57,984 --> 00:58:58,984
I'm okay.

391
1589
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:56,051
Here's your lattes.

392
1593
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,731
- Which cake is good?
- Oh, cake?

393
1598
01:00:03,731 --> 01:00:06,630
Today we have chocolate cake, and cheesecake.

394
1602
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,403
With lattes, cheese cake will probably go better.

395
1606
01:00:08,403 --> 01:00:10,289
Then give us two cheesecakes.

396
1610
01:00:10,289 --> 01:00:11,457
Two? Okay.

397
1614
01:00:28,154 --> 01:00:29,827
Why are you acting like this?  Are you crazy?

398
1618
01:00:31,551 --> 01:00:32,805
No.

399
1622
01:00:33,747 --> 01:00:37,089
I'm perfectly okay.  That's how I know.

400
1626
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:40,981
What? What do you mean you know?

401
1630
01:00:42,836 --> 01:00:43,672
Do you remember?

402
1634
01:00:45,557 --> 01:00:48,870
The story that grandfather used to tell,
the story of the god of the kiln.

403
1639
01:00:50,362 --> 01:00:51,587
What are you talking about?

404
1643
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:59,950
The dish that the kiln god chose was not mine, but yours, Yi Jung.

405
1647
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:01,670
Hyung. (Older brother)

406
1651
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:15,176
This hand . . . How much I wanted this hand.

407
1655
01:01:16,088 --> 01:01:17,739
You don't know, right?

408
1659
01:01:36,074 --> 01:01:37,484
Because of that....

409
1663
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:40,802
you're quitting?

410
1667
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:46,131
So you're leaving me alone like this?

411
1671
01:01:53,301 --> 01:01:54,842
You're running away!

412
1675
01:01:55,995 --> 01:02:02,588
You're leaving me alone in this house.  Leaving me all the responsibilities and you're running away!

413
1679
01:02:21,187 --> 01:02:22,249
Are you alright?

414
1683
01:02:25,257 --> 01:02:30,160
I keep forgetting that I'm not supposed to swim.

415
1687
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:35,842
I'm supposed to be your fireman. And now your lifeguard too?

416
1691
01:02:39,837 --> 01:02:43,783
I forgot something at the spa.
I'll fetch it and be right back.

417
1696
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:49,881
Don't worry. I won't get into trouble again.

418
1700
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:31,169
I'll take her from here.

419
1704
01:04:11,659 --> 01:04:12,573
What?
