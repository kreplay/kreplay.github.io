1
3
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,502
Where are you going this late?

2
7
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:03,371
I'm going to practice. Why?

3
11
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:06,140
Do you want to win that badly?

4
15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,110
We don't have any other choice.

5
19
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:11,746
<i>We?<i></i></i>

6
23
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,019
Why does it have to be Ji Hoo?

7
27
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:23,058
If it wasn't Ji Hoo . . .

8
31
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,194
Goo Joon Pyo.

9
35
00:01:32,332 --> 00:01:34,602
It's not too late.

10
39
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,242
Just say it once.

11
43
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:46,981
Say that you like me, just once.

12
47
00:02:02,564 --> 00:02:05,166
Sorry.

13
51
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,335
I'm sorry.

14
55
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:18,546
Do you know what you're doing right now?

15
59
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:30,925
The great Goo Joon Pyo is begging you.

16
63
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,330
I can't help it.

17
67
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:48,009
How did I end up liking a girl like you?

18
71
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:59,086
You just lost your last chance..

19
75
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:03,090
It doesn't matter how much you cry tomorrow,

20
79
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,394
because I'm not going to watch after you anymore.

21
83
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:13,500
I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.

22
87
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,671
Right. 
I shouldn't have expected any less from you.

23
92
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:23,611
Fine. 
Let's finish this.

24
97
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,702
I won't regret it

25
101
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:52,006
I won't regret it.

26
105
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:56,544
I'll never regret this.

27
109
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:22,403
If they lose, Ji Hoo will be kicked out of F4 and Geum Jan Di will be expelled from school.

28
113
00:04:22,403 --> 00:04:24,639
What if they win?

29
117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,009
Don't be stupid. 
Who would bet on that?

30
122
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,044
N - not me!

31
126
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:32,580
Only a crazy person would bet on them.

32
130
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,484
But  what if they were to win by some kind of a miracle? I could hit the jackpot.

33
134
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:39,053
Gambling is not a miracle.

34
138
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:57,005
Now, we're going to start the last competition.

35
142
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,607
Players, come forward.

36
146
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:16,658
Get ready.

37
150
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,455
Hey! Geum Jan Di, it's the end for you!

38
154
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,493
Yi Jung senior, fighting!

39
158
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:58,226
Justice always prevails!

40
162
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,925
Jan Di, stay strong! A little bit more, a little bit more!

41
166
00:07:54,583 --> 00:08:01,823
Seo Yi Jung! Seo Yi Jung! 
Seo Yi Jung! Seo Yi Jung!

42
171
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,980
Who made it?  Who won?

43
175
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,249
Did you see it?

44
179
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:27,115
No I didn't.

45
183
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,784
Who won?

46
187
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:31,953
Of course it should be Yi Jung senior.

47
191
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:33,321
Who did that?!

48
195
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:56,844
So, it looks like Jan Di and Ji Hoo won't be getting expelled.

49
199
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:58,613
No complaints, right?

50
203
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:05,320
You looked cool.

51
207
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:08,390
Thank you.

52
211
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,826
I should be the one saying that.
Huh?

53
216
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:15,797
Because of a certain someone, my younger brother is becoming a good man.

54
220
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:19,601
Then, see you later.

55
224
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:24,043
I'm so relieved!

56
228
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,110
Geum Jan  Di.

57
232
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,381
That was a good competition.

58
236
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:35,850
You too.

59
240
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:47,429
I'm going to go see Joon Pyo.

60
244
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:06,147
Thank You 
 Thank You.

61
249
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,654
(both) Because of you I . . .

62
253
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:19,861
Geum Jan Di.

63
257
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:25,667
Do you want to go on a date with me?

64
261
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:47,388
Goo Joon Pyo.

65
265
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:50,658
You have greatly repaid your debt.

66
269
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:53,261
Why are you talking to yourself like a crazy person?

67
273
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:59,199
He must still be in shock.

68
277
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,905
Do you remember when I broke Ji Hoo's robot in preschool?

69
281
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:06,374
Robot? 
Oh, the one that's made of wood?

70
286
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,129
That's right.

71
290
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:30,026
Ji Hoo, give this to me.

72
294
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:31,561
No way!

73
298
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:33,930
Give it to me, and I'll give you all my toys.

74
302
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,865
Not that one, Joon Pyo!!

75
306
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:40,803
What do you mean? There is no such thing as "no way". 
It's mine now.

76
311
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,746
It was a handmade gift from his dad who passed away.

77
315
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:40,763
Ever since that time, I've always thought I was in debt to him.

78
319
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:44,166
So you've repaid your debt after this?

79
323
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,544
Geum Jan Di.

80
327
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:52,475
I can't destroy her so that no one can have her.

81
331
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:56,679
Man . . .

82
335
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,930
Joon Pyo!

83
339
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:35,418
Do you want to go on a date with me? 
 Go on a date?

84
344
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:45,094
Date!

85
348
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:49,692
I'm just . . . going out for some fresh air! And some exercise!

86
352
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,894
In those clothes?

87
356
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:57,099
Actually . . 

 You're going on a date with Ji Hoo hyung-nim, right?
(hyung-nim = older brother)

88
363
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,768
How did you know?

89
367
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:01,237
It's too bad that Joon Pyo's heart is broken .  But

90
371
00:15:01,237 --> 00:15:05,241
love doesn't always go as planned.

91
375
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:07,610
That's right. That's right.

92
379
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,415
No matter what the route is, the whole point is to get to the right destination.

93
383
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:19,474
What does that mean? 

So what that means is, you have to look good in front of Young Master Ji Hoo.

94
389
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:25,194
Noona, isn't that dress too long?  Couldn't you make it sexier?

95
393
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:30,333
Jan Di, your lips are too dry. 

Why don't you lick your lips like this?

96
399
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:34,542
Ew, you're disguisting. Jan Di, how a woman smells is very important.

97
403
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,906
You know, irresistible fragrance of temptation!

98
407
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:42,278
Oh, please!

99
411
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,383
I'm going now.

100
415
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:52,628
What else is there?

101
419
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:54,690
Soo Am Culture Center

102
423
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:02,633
The former president's granddaughter-in-law?

103
427
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:18,781
Do you know what time it is?
Let's get out of here.

104
432
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:20,250
I don't want to.

105
436
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,951
Yo, go for a shooting?
That's okay.

106
441
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:25,521
Drive!
-Such a bother!

107
446
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:26,589
What about shopping?

108
450
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:28,557
I don't care.

109
454
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:37,099
The weather's beautiful, but you are gonna stay stuck at home?

110
458
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:42,504
Ji Hoo is probably enjoying his date right now.

111
462
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:48,878
I really can't imagine Ji Hoo and Jan Di together.

112
466
00:16:48,878 --> 00:16:56,184
They might just go somewhere sunny and take a nap there.

113
470
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:58,187
With her head on his arm?

114
474
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,229
Hey! Let's go outside.

115
478
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:12,735
- Let's go!
- Stop!

116
483
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:35,157
Seo Hyun got me  Rui for our first  Christmas together.

117
487
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:38,160
She gave you a horse, as a present?

118
491
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:49,138
When I was young,
I went on a hunger strike for four days to get a puppy.

119
496
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:51,040
How did it end?

120
500
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,443
I got my senses beaten out of me...

121
504
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:57,379
How about a horse instead of a puppy?

122
508
00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:21,997
Geum Jan Di, should we go ride on that?

123
512
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:51,527
Young Master, here is the coffee you asked for.

124
516
00:19:56,932 --> 00:19:58,200
Here.

125
520
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:03,973
30,000 won coffee. ($30)

126
524
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:10,879
How is it? Am I right? 
This is just like having coffee at a sky lounge hotel.

127
529
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:25,561
You want to drink something?

128
533
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:34,803
No, it's okay.

129
537
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:57,159
It's my first time riding this.

130
541
00:20:59,494 --> 00:21:02,931
Hey you ever been on this before?

131
545
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:29,490
Goo Joon Pyo ♥ Geum Jan Di
"Our First night!"

132
550
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:00,780
Are you feeling sick?

133
554
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:06,819
What?
 No, I'm fine.

134
559
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:45,591
She must be doing well, right?

135
563
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:49,230
Let's not talk about that.

136
567
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:55,134
I'm sorry.

137
571
00:22:55,134 --> 00:23:01,874
If apologizing was enough, then there wouldn't be need for laws and police.

138
575
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:44,049
What is this place??

139
579
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,818
My house.

140
583
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:47,320
What?

141
587
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:59,158
[Yoon Ji Hoo  Min Seo Hyun].

142
591
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:26,611
I don't see anyone around.

143
595
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:32,618
When there's people around, it feels uncomfortable. 
They all come by when I'm not home.

144
600
00:26:32,618 --> 00:26:35,187
Yes.

145
604
00:26:35,187 --> 00:26:38,324
It's kind of weird

146
608
00:26:38,324 --> 00:26:42,227
Since I don't feel uncomfortable around you.

147
612
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:46,574
I feel comfortable without reason 
and it's unexplainable how interesting it is.

Also, something about you is warm.

148
619
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:52,805
Me?

149
623
00:27:09,021 --> 00:27:11,556
I think I know

150
627
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:15,928
why Joon Pyo likes you .

151
631
00:27:19,832 --> 00:27:20,767
Geum Jan Di.

152
635
00:27:29,556 --> 00:27:32,511
Oh! It's Seo Hyun unnie!

153
639
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:34,214
And there's you too.

154
643
00:27:36,182 --> 00:27:39,820
Isn't this the horse we just saw? 
The Christmas present.

155
648
00:27:55,534 --> 00:27:56,702
Hey!

156
652
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:31,936
What my friends were saying could be right.

157
656
00:28:31,936 --> 00:28:35,207
If problems didn't occur with Seo Hyun,

158
660
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:37,410
I might never had connected with you.

159
664
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:42,747
Seo Hyun unnie?

160
668
00:28:42,747 --> 00:28:48,220
She says she's not marrying that guy.

161
672
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,855
Then?

162
676
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:53,825
Still, there would be no difference.
Why?

163
681
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:58,865
Because I think it's time for me to let her go.

164
685
00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:01,967
Ji Hoo . . .

165
689
00:29:06,636 --> 00:29:09,774
Anyway, thank you.

166
693
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:14,480
Because of you, I think I am able to let her go.

167
697
00:29:18,316 --> 00:29:20,419
My first love.

168
701
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:23,689
Sunbae . . .

169
705
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:43,442
In this life, they say no matter how many times you break up, you will always see each other again.

170
709
00:29:46,312 --> 00:29:51,616
You will be able to see her again.

171
713
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:59,423
The two of you . . . Because . . .

172
717
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:03,229
Because . . .

173
721
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:21,278
Because . . .

174
725
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:29,054
of Seo Hyun unnie, I could let go too.

175
729
00:30:29,054 --> 00:30:34,727
My first love.

176
733
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:49,435
Goodbye, Ji Hoo sunbae.

177
737
00:32:08,947 --> 00:32:14,485
I might regret it again later, but

178
741
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:17,189
I have to let her go, right?

179
745
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:02,434
What's up with him?

180
749
00:33:02,434 --> 00:33:05,737
It must be because of Geum Jan Di.

181
753
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:11,643
Geum Jan Di and Ji Hoo . . . they must be having a fun time.

182
757
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,522
From Yoon Ji Hoo - 
"See you at the ice hockey rink. One game?!"

183
762
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:27,826
Who is he to tell us when to come and go?

184
766
00:33:39,604 --> 00:33:43,642
You should be on your date, why're you calling us in the middle of the night?

185
770
00:33:43,642 --> 00:33:48,963
Yeah . . . I was going to do that, but . . .

186
774
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:52,017
It was kind of boring. 
So I ran away.

187
779
00:33:52,017 --> 00:33:53,918
What?

188
783
00:33:53,918 --> 00:33:56,688
Easy girls are not my type.

189
787
00:33:58,523 --> 00:34:01,893
I thought she was a tomboy, but she sure is a woman.

190
791
00:34:01,893 --> 00:34:03,895
Ji Hoo, what's wrong with you?

191
795
00:34:03,895 --> 00:34:06,832
She followed me to my house, how could I make her leave?

192
799
00:34:06,832 --> 00:34:07,659
Stop it.

193
803
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:11,269
I was having a hard time because of Seo Hyun.

194
807
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:14,840
But Jan Di wasn’t good for anything other than passing the time.

195
811
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,111
Bastard, you really . . .

196
815
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:36,862
Hey, are you okay?

197
819
00:35:32,283 --> 00:35:35,220
Say that again. Who is WHAT?

198
823
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,155
Her body wasn't that bad

199
827
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:38,356
You must really want to die!

200
831
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:43,695
It has nothing to do with you anymore.

201
835
00:35:43,695 --> 00:35:48,200
It does have to do with me.

202
839
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:05,250
If you hurt Geum Jan Di, I don't care whether you're a friend or not

 I'm going to kill you! Got it?!

203
845
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:10,021
You should have said that sooner.

204
849
00:36:20,098 --> 00:36:23,335
See? You can't give up on Geum Jan Di.

205
853
00:36:25,837 --> 00:36:28,673
You should have been honest so I didn't have to do all this.

206
857
00:36:29,975 --> 00:36:32,844
You crazy bastard.

207
861
00:36:54,499 --> 00:36:57,302
You. That was a bit too much of a strategy.

208
865
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,837
Why didn't you say anything sooner?

209
869
00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:00,972
He had a debt to pay.

210
873
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,944
That punk broke my robot.

211
877
00:37:35,806 --> 00:37:37,797
Cheap things look good on you.

212
881
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:42,647
Don't lose it just because it's cheap, or I'll kill you.

213
885
00:37:45,617 --> 00:37:47,285
Just once.

214
889
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:54,326
Say that you like me. 
Just once.

215
894
00:37:54,326 --> 00:37:59,431
Goo Joon Pyo ♥ Geum Jan Di 
"Our first night!!"

216
899
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:09,107
"Goo Joon Pyo"

217
903
00:38:13,878 --> 00:38:16,948
I don't want to be in a bad mood because of you, I'm in a really good mood . . .

218
907
00:38:19,718 --> 00:38:21,386
Yi Jung sunbae?

219
911
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:28,474
What? 
What did you say?

220
916
00:39:03,894 --> 00:39:05,964
"Goo Joon Pyo"

221
920
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:04,055
Hey, Goo Joon Pyo!

222
924
00:40:04,055 --> 00:40:06,023
Wake up!

223
928
00:40:06,023 --> 00:40:08,392
Geum Jan Di is here!

224
932
00:40:08,392 --> 00:40:10,195
Come on wake up buddy!!

225
936
00:40:12,864 --> 00:40:14,966
This can't be.

226
940
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:17,735
It must be a lie . . .

227
944
00:40:17,735 --> 00:40:19,637
Why, all of a sudden?

228
948
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:22,640
What happened?

229
952
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,313
He said he was going to see you, ran out and . . .

230
956
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:55,939
Goo Joon Pyo . . .

231
960
00:40:55,939 --> 00:40:58,108
Wake up!

232
964
00:40:58,108 --> 00:41:00,011
Why are you lying there?

233
968
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:04,616
I have lots of things to tell you.

234
972
00:41:04,616 --> 00:41:06,518
And to fight with you about.

235
976
00:41:07,218 --> 00:41:10,021
And lots of things to explain to you.

236
980
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:12,423
What are you doing?!

237
984
00:41:12,423 --> 00:41:17,429
He was so gloomy all day and all of a sudden he said he had to apologize to you.

238
988
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:22,667
I am the one who should apologize.

239
992
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:26,037
Goo Joon Pyo, I was wrong.

240
996
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:29,274
I lied to you

241
1000
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,078
the last time .

242
1004
00:41:36,014 --> 00:41:39,751
I haven't told you yet.  Those words.

243
1008
00:41:41,686 --> 00:41:44,822
I regretted it, after I let you go.

244
1012
00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:51,462
Goo Joon Pyo!  

 Goo Joon Pyo, wake up!

245
1018
00:41:54,098 --> 00:42:00,271
I think I can tell you the words you've wanted to hear, but how am I going to tell you if you're like this?

246
1022
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:02,307
Wake up!

247
1026
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:14,919
For real?

248
1030
00:42:26,606 --> 00:42:29,042
Wow, Geum Jan Di must have been really shocked!

249
1034
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:31,310
Look at her shoes! Her shoes!

250
1038
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,646
Joon Pyo! You must be happy.

251
1042
00:42:33,346 --> 00:42:37,751
I heard it is minus 10 degrees out there; weren't you cold?
Geum Jan Di, how touching.

252
1047
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:40,853
If I were Joon Pyo, I could die with no regrets!

253
1051
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:42,188
Sunbae!

254
1055
00:42:42,188 --> 00:42:45,158
I am sorry.

 You two were pretty stubborn.

255
1061
00:42:45,926 --> 00:42:49,228
You, tell me what you said you were going to do earlier.

256
1065
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:51,697
What?

257
1069
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:54,701
Those words i wanted to hear . . .

258
1073
00:43:00,072 --> 00:43:02,609
Ow!   Is this the way to treat a patient?

259
1077
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:06,279
Are you a patient!  
Urgh!

260
1082
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:08,915
What is this!

261
1086
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:10,683
Ouch! Ouch!

262
1090
00:43:10,683 --> 00:43:12,285
You idiot!

263
1094
00:44:21,821 --> 00:44:24,190
One, two, three, four!

264
1098
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,095
five, six, seven, eight!

265
1102
00:44:27,095 --> 00:44:35,335
Two, two, three, four!
Five, six, seven, eight!
Two, two, three, four!

266
1108
00:44:52,018 --> 00:44:54,120
What're you doing in someone else's neighborhood early in the morning?

267
1112
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,756
The roads are icy, you should be home. Where are you going?

268
1116
00:44:57,756 --> 00:44:59,859
I'm doing some exercise now.

269
1120
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:02,929
You even exercise like the poor.

270
1124
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:04,631
Get in!
Why?

271
1129
00:45:04,631 --> 00:45:05,965
You said you were exercising.

272
1133
00:45:31,024 --> 00:45:32,825
What are you doing? Get in!

273
1137
00:45:44,938 --> 00:45:46,506
Try it.

274
1141
00:45:51,978 --> 00:45:55,515
Bend your knees a little more.

275
1145
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,272
Nice shot!

276
1149
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,660
Goo JoonPyo! Hey! Hey!

277
1153
00:47:50,163 --> 00:47:52,432
I'm so full.

278
1157
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:56,202
If you're done eating, let's go.

279
1161
00:48:04,209 --> 00:48:08,247
You go first, I'll be right back.

280
1165
00:48:14,387 --> 00:48:22,628
Here you go. 
Thank you!  Thank you!

281
1170
00:48:25,565 --> 00:48:28,668
Thank you! I'll come again next time! Thank you!

282
1174
00:48:32,138 --> 00:48:35,040
Oh my, who is this?

283
1178
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,076
Isn't it Geum Jan Di?

284
1182
00:48:37,076 --> 00:48:39,378
Why are you here?

285
1186
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:44,117
Do you know her? 
 No
But, what's that?

286
1192
00:48:45,685 --> 00:48:47,220
Oh!  That smell!

287
1196
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,422
Did she come here to collect this rubbish?

288
1200
00:48:49,422 --> 00:48:52,859
What to do? 
You're going to eat the leftovers?

289
1205
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:57,730
How pitiful!

290
1209
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:01,634
Do you want to wait a while more? 
When we're done eating, you can have our leftovers.

291
1214
00:49:05,037 --> 00:49:06,572
What are you guys doing?

292
1218
00:49:23,889 --> 00:49:25,791
Why are you still here?

293
1222
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:27,994
Joon Pyo! Long time no see!

294
1226
00:49:27,994 --> 00:49:30,329
You have new taste in women?

295
1230
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:35,633
What is she? 
Your maid?

296
1235
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:39,270
Do you want to shut up nicely?

297
1239
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:43,276
Or would you like to read the news tomorrow morning about your company going under?

298
1243
00:49:43,276 --> 00:49:44,510
I was wrong.

299
1247
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,212
Not to me.

300
1251
00:49:53,052 --> 00:49:55,788
Excuse me, please forgive me.

301
1255
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:22,381
What should I do?
 I can't even swallow my saliva naturally.

302
1260
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:26,885
How should I start so that it seems normal?

303
1264
00:50:26,885 --> 00:50:29,555
Why is it so hot?

304
1268
00:50:29,555 --> 00:50:32,725
If I take my jacket off she's going to have a fit.

305
1272
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:35,161
Aishh, really!

306
1276
00:50:40,305 --> 00:50:43,102
All of a sudden, why is it this kind of scene?

307
1280
00:50:43,102 --> 00:50:47,275
Goo Joon Pyo!  Do it now!

308
1284
00:50:47,275 --> 00:50:48,442
Turn your head!

309
1288
00:50:48,442 --> 00:50:56,315
NO! 
Don't look at me, please! 
Goo Joon Pyo, if you turn toward me, you're so dead!

310
1294
00:50:56,315 --> 00:51:01,721
Ugh!  I can't do it!  
I'll just  have some popcorn.

311
1299
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:56,776
Hello?
Jan Di!

312
1304
00:52:03,649 --> 00:52:04,684
I'm home . . .

313
1308
00:52:08,153 --> 00:52:14,260
Mom, this eel is really soft.
Honey, this is eel. . .

314
1313
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,996
The stamina food eel, eel..

315
1317
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:19,532
Where did all of this come from?

316
1321
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:21,968
Why do you always ask the obvious?

317
1325
00:52:21,968 --> 00:52:24,181
Joon Pyo hyung-nim ordered all of this.

318
1329
00:52:24,181 --> 00:52:26,739
The head chef brought this here in person!

319
1333
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:30,876
He brought this huge tuna fish and prepared it on the spot!

320
1337
00:52:30,876 --> 00:52:34,780
I THOUGHT THE TUNA WAS A WHALE!!

321
1341
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,016
Hurry up and eat! 
Eat a lot!

322
1346
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:44,530
Honey, let's eat and die today!

323
1350
00:52:45,731 --> 00:52:48,300
Give it to Dad, give it to Dad.

324
1354
00:53:24,135 --> 00:53:28,073
I'm saying this beforehand because you might get mad again, but I wasn't giving those to you.

325
1358
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,548
Don't eat even one slice of it.

326
1362
00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:59,939
So, I'm walking and someone taps my shoulder.

327
1366
00:53:59,939 --> 00:54:02,507
And then?!

328
1370
00:54:02,507 --> 00:54:05,244
Do you want to watch a movie with me?

329
1374
00:54:05,244 --> 00:54:08,647
That's so cheesy!

330
1378
00:54:12,384 --> 00:54:15,220
Jan Di 

 is something wrong?

331
1384
00:54:17,856 --> 00:54:19,458
"Goo Joon Pyo"

332
1388
00:54:22,994 --> 00:54:24,530
Hello?

333
1392
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:26,064
Oh Goo Joon Pyo!

334
1396
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:30,135
I can't hear you.

335
1400
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:32,204
I'm at the porridge shop. I'm very busy!

336
1404
00:54:32,204 --> 00:54:33,772
There are SO MANY customers!

337
1408
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:35,774
Can I have a porridge over here?

338
1412
00:54:35,774 --> 00:54:37,613
Yes! I got it!

339
1416
00:54:37,613 --> 00:54:38,310
Did you hear that?

340
1420
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:41,446
I'm very, very, very busy right now so I have to work late.

341
1424
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:43,015
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

342
1428
00:54:49,154 --> 00:54:52,216
Jan Di, what porridge shop were you talking about?

343
1432
00:54:54,326 --> 00:54:56,427
Hey, can you give me some more kimchi(a Korean spicy cabbage food)?

344
1436
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:59,298
Please, hold on.

345
1440
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:40,539
Ji Hoo sunbae!

346
1444
00:55:49,715 --> 00:55:51,984
Thank you!

347
1448
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:54,586
It's warm

348
1452
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,122
You practice during break too?

349
1456
00:55:58,257 --> 00:55:59,742
Just because.

350
1460
00:55:59,742 --> 00:56:01,960
It didn't seem just because.

351
1464
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,053
I thought it was a training center for Olympic athletes.

352
1468
00:56:05,097 --> 00:56:08,367
Swimming makes me feel better is all.

353
1472
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:11,370
Is something wrong?

354
1476
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:17,257
Sunbae, what about you? 
Why did you come back to school?

355
1481
00:56:17,257 --> 00:56:19,678
I left some sheet music here.

356
1485
00:56:24,916 --> 00:56:26,251
Oh, Joon Pyo!

357
1489
00:56:26,985 --> 00:56:30,257
Me? I'm at school.

358
1493
00:56:30,257 --> 00:56:31,924
Here, Geum . . .

359
1497
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,861
Alright then.

360
1501
00:56:36,861 --> 00:56:38,530
I'll wait.

361
1505
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,132
I got it.

362
1509
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:45,103
Joon Pyo said he's on his way.

363
1513
00:56:45,103 --> 00:56:47,172
If you wait, you can see him.

364
1517
00:56:47,172 --> 00:56:49,274
Yes

365
1521
00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:52,977
But why . . .

366
1525
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:58,831
I'm really busy today and I have to hurry back home, I forgot.

367
1529
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:01,853
Sunbae, I'll see you later. Thanks for the coffee.

368
1533
00:57:13,031 --> 00:57:15,133
What? There was someone with you?

369
1537
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:16,702
Huh? No.

370
1541
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:23,342
Eh? It's all cold!

371
1545
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:34,486
It looks so delicious.

372
1549
00:57:34,486 --> 00:57:37,889
Expensive food spoiled our taste.

373
1553
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:40,092
Isn't Sis going on any dates?

374
1557
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:41,564
I know. . .

375
1561
00:57:41,564 --> 00:57:44,171
It would be nice if it was a Chinese restaurant this time, right?

376
1565
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:47,466
They should go to an Italian restaurant. Have something special.

377
1569
00:57:47,466 --> 00:57:52,871
That's right. What are those? Those snails.
Escargot!

378
1574
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:55,040
That's a French cuisine.

379
1578
00:57:56,575 --> 00:57:57,476
Who is it?

380
1582
00:58:08,186 --> 00:58:15,260
Who was it?
If they came to get the bill back, tell them your parents aren't here.

381
1587
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,595
G.. G...

382
1591
00:58:16,595 --> 00:58:19,097
They came to pick up geureut(plates)? Did you guys order something while I was gone?

383
1595
00:58:20,165 --> 00:58:21,467
J, Joo . . .

384
1599
00:58:21,467 --> 00:58:25,136
If it's the landlord, tell him that your parents have passed away.

385
1603
00:58:25,136 --> 00:58:28,774
Joon Pyo . . . Joon Pyo hyung-nim!

386
1607
00:58:28,774 --> 00:58:30,175
What!?

387
1611
00:58:39,651 --> 00:58:43,989
Sh . . . Shin Hwa!

388
1615
00:58:43,989 --> 00:58:46,358
Young master!

389
1619
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:51,797
Will it be alright if I come in?

390
1623
00:59:13,085 --> 00:59:15,520
Why are you here at such a late hour?

391
1627
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,025
What do you mean late? 
It's only 10.
It's just early evening.

392
1633
00:59:21,626 --> 00:59:24,094
Father. 
 Father!

393
1638
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:26,698
Honey, did you hear that? 
He called me father.

394
1643
00:59:30,302 --> 00:59:31,536
And, Mother.

395
1647
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:33,171
Oh, Honey.

396
1651
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,976
Please let me stay over for the night.

397
1655
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:41,079
What?

398
1659
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,047
What did he just say?

399
1663
00:59:43,015 --> 00:59:44,160
You've lost your mind, right?

400
1667
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,786
Why would you leave your good house and sleep at mine? 
Who said you could?

401
1672
00:59:47,786 --> 00:59:49,287
I said!

402
1676
00:59:49,287 --> 00:59:51,256
No, I said! 
MOM!

403
1681
00:59:51,256 --> 00:59:54,993
It's so late at night, of course you have to sleep here!

404
1685
00:59:54,993 --> 00:59:59,289
It's already past 10! 
Where are you going to go this late at night?

405
1690
00:59:59,289 --> 01:00:02,233
Hyung-nim, you can sleep with me!

406
1694
01:00:02,233 --> 01:00:03,768
No way!!

407
1698
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:14,779
It's a bit too short, but they still look good!

408
1702
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:22,587
Oh my, no matter what you wear, you look like a model! 

Don't you think this style will be the new fashion?

409
1708
01:00:29,761 --> 01:00:31,696
I'm done with the preparations!

410
1712
01:00:31,696 --> 01:00:34,633
Preparations? 
What preparations?

411
1717
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:39,905
Tada! 
Honey, isn't that our . . .

412
1722
01:00:39,905 --> 01:00:43,942
first night on our honeymoon . . . .

413
1726
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:51,650
Mom!

414
1730
01:01:19,444 --> 01:01:22,013
Goo Joon Pyo, are you really going to do this?

415
1734
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:25,383
I didn't think about it before coming here, but this is really interesting.

416
1738
01:01:25,383 --> 01:01:28,320
What?
How can the main room be smaller than the toilet in my house?

417
1743
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,555
The toilet at your house is abnormal!

418
1747
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:35,092
The highlight is that we are going to sleep like this with 5 people in one room.

419
1751
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:36,995
No one's gonna believe this.

420
1755
01:01:36,995 --> 01:01:38,096
Is it funny?

421
1759
01:01:38,096 --> 01:01:39,130
Isn't it funny?

422
1763
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:43,535
Then continue to enjoy. Just don't regret it later.

423
1767
01:01:43,535 --> 01:01:47,973
Regret what? 
It feels like I'm experiencing a refugee's life. How thrilling.

424
1772
01:01:47,973 --> 01:01:51,376
I'm going to sleep. 
If you make me talk again, you're dead.

425
1777
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:59,784
Still, with everyone sleeping under the same blanket, doesn't it seem like a family?

426
1781
01:02:04,856 --> 01:02:08,126
Hey, dry cleaner. 
Are you sleeping?

427
1786
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:13,932
Are you really going to sleep first?

428
1790
01:02:15,466 --> 01:02:16,501
Hey, dry cleaner!

429
1794
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:24,776
Dry cleaners! Dry cleaners! Jan Di's Dry Cleaners is here!

430
1798
01:02:26,478 --> 01:02:30,181
Escargots, bird's nest . . .

431
1802
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:33,585
Sweet and sour pork is good too!

432
1806
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:53,700
Honey! 
Sweet and sour pork . . .
