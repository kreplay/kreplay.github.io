1
3
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:09,890
I'm only here because your house was the closest.

2
7
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,013
Yi Jung would give me grief because of the fight we had in Macau.

3
11
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:16,552
And at Woo Bin's place, the girls are too loud.

4
15
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,899
What about the punch I took?

5
19
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:22,355
What are you going to do about that?

6
23
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:28,054
Uh, fine. Hit me.
It'll be settled if I let you hit me once.

7
28
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,857
Hurry.  Hit me.

8
32
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:34,220
What's going on with the engagement?

9
36
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,051
I don't know.  How can I know all the machinations of the Old Witch?

10
40
00:01:39,888 --> 00:01:45,591
Engagement, my foot.  And of all the girls, where did she come up with one like her?

11
44
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:52,040
Did...everyone, get back safely?

12
48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,042
If you're wondering about Jan Di, then yes, she made it back safely.

13
52
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:59,319
Did anyone say I was curious?

14
56
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:07,016
Hey, it's your friend's birthday and you haven't even given me a present!

15
60
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:09,702
Hurry up and hand it over.

16
64
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,520
What is this?

17
68
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:44,984
<i>Goo Joon Pyo, 
Happy birthday.</i>

18
73
00:02:44,984 --> 00:02:51,890
<i>I'll be praying that this birthday is not a lonely one, but one filled with happiness.</i>

19
77
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,797
<i>Geum Jan Di.</i>

20
81
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:30,628
- What I said to Joon Pyo in Macau...
 - I know.

21
86
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:35,000
You only said it because you were mad at Goo Joon Pyo.

22
90
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:21,013
You there! Hey, you, Beef Jerky!

23
94
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:29,680
I was right. I'm right. The beef jerky girl in Macau, right?

24
98
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:34,504
Hello. How is it that you're here?

25
102
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:39,454
Hey. I'm your life saver but you don't seem all that happy to see me.

26
106
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:41,831
I'm really happy to see you.

27
110
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:47,272
I'm happy to see you too, but why are you here?

28
114
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:49,742
I came to look for someone.

29
118
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:56,615
- Goo Joon Pyo?
- Oh, how do you know that?

30
123
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:58,318
Do you know that jerk?

31
127
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:06,291
Oh right. Your name is... 
Jan Di. Geum Jan Di.

32
132
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,029
Oh, Geum Jan Di. Do you remember my name?

33
136
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:13,499
Ha Jae Kyung.

34
140
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:18,203
Seeing that you're in a uniform, I take it that you're still in high school.

35
144
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:21,507
Junior?  Senior? 
 Senior.

36
149
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:25,773
I'm going to start attending Shin Hwa University. That's great. Shall we be big sister/little sister?

37
153
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:30,551
Eh?
Oh! You're cute!

38
158
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:35,991
From the first time I saw you, you really appealed to me, little sister, Jan Di.

39
162
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:38,724
Little sister Jan Di?

40
166
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:42,094
Where is that jerk hiding?

41
170
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:47,085
Oh! Why is that girl here?

42
174
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:51,803
Oh, I found him!

43
178
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:58,378
You found what?
What do you mean, "What"?

44
183
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:03,015
My fiance, of course!
You'd better let go!

45
188
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:06,552
Why? You don't like my greeting?

46
192
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:09,354
Then would you rather I bite your ear, like last time?

47
196
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:18,530
What is this crazy monkey saying? Why don't you just buzz off?!

48
200
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:23,956
I'm only going to say this once, so don't forget it.  My name is Ha Jae Kyung.

49
204
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:26,038
From today on, I am your fiancÃ©e.

50
208
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,341
You got it? And keep in mind.

51
212
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:30,577
Keep what in mind?

52
216
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:34,667
From here on, I'm going to tame you.

53
220
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,849
Bang!

54
224
00:06:56,435 --> 00:07:00,272
From today, Joon Pyo is going to be attending Shin Hwa University with us.

55
228
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:06,746
So you're okay, then?

56
232
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:09,648
- About what? 
- That girl.

57
237
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:14,353
That fiancee girl. Doesn't that fiancee bother you when she goes running after Joon Pyo sunbae?

58
241
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:17,790
What does that have to do with me?

59
245
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,093
And that unni...
Unni?

60
250
00:07:23,212 --> 00:07:25,097
She seems like a cool person.

61
254
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:29,768
No, she is a cool person.

62
258
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,404
Who? Who's a cool person?

63
262
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:37,642
Why are you here?

64
266
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:41,814
Hi!  I'm Ha Jae Kyung.  Are you Jan Di's friend?

65
270
00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:44,883
I'm also a friend of Jan Di. It's nice to meet you.

66
274
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:48,654
- Eh? 
- Oh, so you work part-time here?

67
279
00:07:48,654 --> 00:07:51,490
It must be fun. I've always wanted to do something like that.

68
283
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:53,494
Then do it!

69
287
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:57,863
Since you are such a universally beautiful woman, you are welcome any time.

70
291
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:03,168
For now, I'll just borrow my two friends today.

71
295
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:04,636
Sorry?

72
299
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:09,240
Chen, don't think of following me and take care of the things here.

73
303
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,445
Jan Di, Ga Eul, you guys are going to go somewhere without me again, right?

74
307
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:19,451
Don't worry about the porridge restaurant and go.

75
311
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:09,101
You know, I've really always wanted to do stuff like this:

76
315
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:14,273
Gossip with my girlfriends and bad-mouth my boyfriend and get advice about dating.

77
319
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:19,478
You don't have any friends?

78
323
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,348
No, I don't have any friends.

79
327
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,637
Eat.

80
331
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:07,190
Since I was young, I traveled so much to places like India, Europe, Africa.

81
335
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,427
I didn't have time to make friends.

82
339
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:18,837
So, what kind of style does Joon Pyo like?

83
343
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:46,001
Ah, it's pretty.

84
347
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,478
Jan Di..

85
351
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:04,716
Girly style or boyish style?

86
355
00:11:04,716 --> 00:11:07,638
Or does he prefer a cute style?

87
359
00:11:08,554 --> 00:11:14,626
He's too busy worrying about his own style from head to toe.

88
363
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:17,529
He probably won't remember what you were wearing.

89
367
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:21,033
The more I learn about him, the more I like him.

90
371
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:23,569
I like the serious type.

91
375
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:27,405
Tell me more about him, Jan Di.

92
379
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:40,817
He is second to none when it comes to disdaining others and being arrogant.

93
383
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:44,763
He acts like a total know-it-all, but in reality, he's ignorant.

94
387
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:53,053
And... if he likes something...

95
391
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:56,936
he ignores others' opinions and pushes his own...

96
395
00:11:58,124 --> 00:12:00,607
just like a bulldozer.

97
399
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:09,201
He's really scary when he's angry, but,

98
403
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:12,071
when he's being nice,

99
407
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:15,542
he's really sweet.

100
411
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:29,850
Ah, in any case, if you put childish, spoiled, whiny brat all together,

101
415
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,866
that about sums him up.

102
419
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:34,227
JanDi, you really know JoonPyo well.

103
423
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,466
I'm impressed. I have a favor to ask you.

104
427
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:40,500
What is it?

105
431
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,116
I really want to make a go of things with him.

106
435
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:47,741
Jan Di, from today can you be my dating coach?

107
439
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:51,598
I'm begging you.

108
443
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:13,931
That girl is an interesting character, isn't she?

109
447
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:18,407
That's true. She's second only to Geum Jan Di.

110
451
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:22,116
What's so funny?

111
455
00:13:22,116 --> 00:13:25,381
Your fiancee. She's really funny.

112
459
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:27,047
Fiancee, who says she's my fiancee?

113
463
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,371
Why not? I'm in favor of it.

114
467
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:33,620
Compared to all the other rich and snoby girls, she's not so bad.

115
471
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,040
But, when did you guys get so intimate?  I distinctly remember her saying she bit your ear.

116
475
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,895
Joon Pyo, isn't that your weak spot?

117
479
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:45,802
To be more exact, it's his sensitive spot.

118
483
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,202
Do you guys think this is funny?

119
487
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:50,504
Well?

120
491
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:53,717
And you call yourselves my friends...

121
495
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,011
Move aside.

122
499
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:08,290
Seriously, how will he handle it?

123
503
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,058
Sounds like Joon Pyo's stuck in a corner and can't do anything.

124
507
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:16,447
It's one thing that the engagement is a business deal, but if she actually has feelings for him...

125
511
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:18,434
And on top of that, it's the JK Group.

126
515
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:22,878
If we don't do something fast, it'll only be a matter of time before Joon Pyo walks down the aisle.

127
519
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:24,571
You guys can take care of it.

128
523
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,056
What?

129
527
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:31,506
F4's Don Juan and Casanova.

130
531
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:33,614
Use some of your legendary skills.

131
535
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:50,287
We can just go on by ourselves now.

132
539
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:56,770
I had a lot of fun today.  And from now on, you two are Ha Jae Kyung's best friends.

133
543
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,005
Okay?
 Huh?

134
548
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:03,328
Oh, and this.  This is Jan Di's.

135
552
00:15:04,232 --> 00:15:05,545
And this is Ga Eul's.

136
556
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,309
What is this?

137
560
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,404
Their gifts to thank you for being my friends.

138
564
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:12,786
Good Night!

139
568
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:24,931
That unnie seems a little strange.

140
572
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:28,001
A bit, eh?

141
576
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:32,877
In any case,  she's not someone you can dislike easily.

142
580
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:47,921
Ah, it's cold.

143
584
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:49,058
You're back?

144
588
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,163
What's with everyone?

145
592
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,432
Is something wrong?

146
596
00:15:58,432 --> 00:16:01,401
Is it true that Master Goo Joon Pyo got engaged?

147
600
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:04,404
How did you find that out?

148
604
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,663
It's true.

149
608
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,625
Ah, what can we do about this?

150
612
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:30,730
All this time we waited thinking "no news is good news", but...

151
616
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,234
What can we do for Jan Di?
What do you mean by "What can we do for Jan Di"?

152
621
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:37,574
As if I have anything to do with him.

153
625
00:16:37,574 --> 00:16:38,583
What?

154
629
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:41,209
Did someone die?

155
633
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,612
Why shouldn't you be concerned?  Until just last year, you were slated to be
 the daughter-in-law of the Shin Hwa Group.

156
638
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:48,081
What do you mean this doesn't concern you?

157
642
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:51,017
Wait just a second. We're really ruined.

158
646
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:55,155
I mean, where did this girl even come from?

159
650
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:59,692
This is just like the saying that the wheel that rolls in displaces the wheel that's in place.

160
654
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:04,631
Wait a second. We should find out what her name is and what her family does.

161
658
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:27,153
Hello.

162
662
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:28,856
Hi.

163
666
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:38,513
Wow, these are nice!

164
670
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:41,465
My name is Ha Jae Kyung.

165
674
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:43,431
Jan Di and I decided to be friends.

166
678
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:45,905
Oh no, I'm her unnie.

167
682
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:49,309
Wow, even your name is pretty. 
 Your face is pretty, too.

168
687
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,998
What a pretty name!

169
691
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:54,797
Your face is pretty too.

170
695
00:17:54,797 --> 00:18:00,547
If you and Jan Di decided to become sisters, then we should just make you a part of the family.
 Shouldn't we, honey?

171
700
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,957
From now on, think of this as your home and come to visit often.

172
704
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,292
Thank you!

173
708
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:10,063
Then, can I sleep over tonight?

174
712
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,939
Sorry?

175
716
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,948
Don't you get the feeling of a deja vu from this situation?

176
720
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:32,786
Yeah, I kept thinking that too.

177
724
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:35,188
Jan Di, where's your room? 


178
729
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:41,868
It seems just like a pajama party.

179
733
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:45,465
I always wanted to do something like this.

180
737
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:47,534
This room is really cozy.

181
741
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:51,171
Is it?

182
745
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,932
It's really fascinating.

183
749
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:55,976
What is it?

184
753
00:18:55,976 --> 00:19:00,046
Meeting Jan Di and Joon Pyo in Macau.

185
757
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:02,282
Seems like fate.

186
761
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:06,353
You've known Joon Pyo since Macau? 


187
766
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:12,258
I guess I must have liked him since the first time I saw him.

188
770
00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:19,264
Engagement. If it had been anybody else, I would've made a scene.

189
774
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:23,069
But from the moment I saw him, my heart started racing.

190
778
00:19:24,604 --> 00:19:26,873
Jan Di, have you  ever felt like that?

191
782
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:30,010
I mean, do you have anybody you like?

192
786
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,378
Like a first love?

193
790
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:39,118
So you do have one. What kind of person is he?

194
794
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:54,100
He was a rather dull person.

195
798
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,769
A dull person?

196
802
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:05,411
The kind of person that made me feel dull by comparison.

197
806
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:08,614
He was that kind of person.

198
810
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:12,685
Oh, I get it. He must be someone you feel comfortable with, a really sweet person.

199
814
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:18,657
Goo Joon Pyo is just like wine.

200
818
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:19,993
Wine?

201
822
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:24,998
Wine has a great aroma. As soon as you drink it, your whole body just turns upside down.

202
826
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:27,033
That kind of exhilarating feeling.

203
830
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:34,907
Wait! You don't think he has a girl that he likes, does he?

204
834
00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:40,613
Doesn't matter.  I just need to make him like me.

205
838
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:50,222
It's been a really long time since there's been something that I really wanted
 that I had to work hard on my own to get.

206
843
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:36,302
What?

207
847
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:39,138
Do you have something to say?

208
851
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:41,240
Why aren't you swimming?

209
855
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,942
I quit.

210
859
00:21:42,942 --> 00:21:44,644
Why would a swimmer quit swimming?

211
863
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:46,612
None of your business.

212
867
00:21:46,612 --> 00:21:48,681
Did you follow me just to ask that?

213
871
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:51,216
It's not in my nature to just let things go,

214
875
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:53,119
since I have to uncover what needs to be uncovered.

215
879
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,254
What?

216
883
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:59,725
That engagement or whatever. It doesn't concern me.

217
887
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:02,795
It doesn't concern me either.

218
891
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,463
Goo Joon Pyo...

219
895
00:22:04,463 --> 00:22:09,736
You've gotten really friendly; explaining things like this to the stain you want to erase.

220
899
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:22,349
Over there.  Your fiancee is headed this way.

221
903
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:31,572
Why is that monkey showing up again?

222
907
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,844
Sunbae.  Could you give me a ride?

223
911
00:23:00,153 --> 00:23:03,471
What a coincidence to see you both together like this!

224
915
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:05,594
Jan Di and Joon Pyo, I guess you two are really close.

225
919
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:14,067
- Oh. Who's this person?
- This is Ji Hoo sunbae.

226
924
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:16,111
Why are you introducing my friend?

227
928
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:20,507
Hey, monkey!  This is my friend, Yoon Ji Hoo.

228
932
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:30,016
Do you like him? Looks like you know what good-looking is.

229
936
00:23:31,397 --> 00:23:32,477
I get it.

230
940
00:23:33,652 --> 00:23:37,643
What?
This person's the one, right?

231
945
00:23:37,643 --> 00:23:41,027
What?
The guy Jan Di likes.

232
950
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:48,868
Oh, unni, no that's not... this person and I...

233
954
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:53,047
That's great, let's go hang out, the four of us.  What do you think? It's a good idea, eh?

234
958
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:55,475
- No. 
- We can't.

235
963
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,498
Eh? Why not?

236
967
00:23:58,498 --> 00:24:02,115
Uh, I have to go someplace urgently, right now.

237
971
00:24:02,115 --> 00:24:06,052
Unni, you two just go off and have fun.

238
975
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,556
Sunbae, let's hurry up and go.

239
979
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:17,730
Uh...

240
983
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:28,074
What shall we do now?

241
987
00:24:28,074 --> 00:24:30,543
Do? Do what?

242
991
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:35,682
Let's go together!

243
995
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:58,137
Are you working part-time here, too?

244
999
00:24:58,137 --> 00:25:00,540
It's not a part-time job. I'm here to volunteer.

245
1003
00:25:01,841 --> 00:25:05,945
I  just clean and help out here and there.

246
1007
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:08,681
But when I'm here, I feel relaxed and I'm albe to study.

247
1011
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:11,684
It's fascinating.

248
1015
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:13,016
What is?

249
1019
00:25:13,016 --> 00:25:15,221
How you can do everything so diligently.

250
1023
00:25:17,757 --> 00:25:19,725
I guess I'll go inside then.

251
1027
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:20,527
Bye.

252
1031
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:26,300
Geum Jan Di!

253
1035
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:30,803
I can clean pretty well, too.

254
1039
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:35,675
Hello.

255
1043
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,610
Hello!

256
1047
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,583
Hi!

257
1051
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,380
Pretty girl, why are you only coming now?

258
1055
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,717
I had to go to school. Just a minute.

259
1059
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:48,288
You must eat before. 
Hello!

260
1064
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:53,693
Thank you. 
Yes. On Sunday, be sure to come and eat here. Got that?

261
1069
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:55,128
Grandma, let me check your temperature.

262
1073
00:25:55,128 --> 00:25:56,796
Go. Be careful.

263
1077
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,212
Ji Hoo!  Ji Hoo!

264
1081
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:34,233
What? That old man's, I mean, that doctor's grandson is Ji Hoo sunbae?

265
1085
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:41,708
So, Ji Hoo sunbae is the grandson of  former President Yoon? So that grandpa is...

266
1089
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:45,545
...former President Yoon Suk Young?
No way!

267
1094
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:47,513
How is it they've gone on this long without seeing each other?

268
1098
00:26:48,114 --> 00:26:51,084
Going on this long without seeing each other wasn't a choice. They couldn't see each other.

269
1102
00:26:51,084 --> 00:26:55,087
What's that supposed to mean?  Come on, what's your relationship to that grandpa?

270
1106
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:58,691
Jan Di, those two people, you have to help them.

271
1110
00:26:58,691 --> 00:27:00,893
Huh?

272
1114
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:02,428
Welc . . .

273
1118
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:05,098
Hello.

274
1122
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:10,570
- Ga Eul, some water. 
- Me too.

275
1127
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:14,474
What's going on with you guys?

276
1131
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:59,552
Queen Elizabeth liked this piece..
 Do you like it too?

277
1136
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,863
Wow! 
 You're giving this to me?

278
1141
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:17,636
Whether it be man or dish, we're always waiting for a woman to properly appreciate us.

279
1145
00:28:17,636 --> 00:28:22,241
Thank you. If i give this to my Leon as his water dish, he'll love it.

280
1149
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:24,543
Leon?

281
1153
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:26,779
It's my pet lion's name.

282
1157
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,250
Lion?

283
1161
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:45,832
Hey, miss.

284
1165
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:48,701
You've got a killer style.

285
1169
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:50,470
Why don't you have a cup of tea with us?

286
1173
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,071
It's cold, don't you think?

287
1177
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:57,409
Laughing?

288
1181
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:59,385
This lady has no fear.

289
1185
00:28:59,385 --> 00:29:00,847
Kids.

290
1189
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:04,884
Stop it right now.

291
1193
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:08,554
Who are you?

292
1197
00:29:10,423 --> 00:29:12,759
You shouldn't bother a pretty lady.

293
1201
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:16,295
Stop fooling around and get lost.

294
1205
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:18,197
We had dibs on her first.

295
1209
00:29:18,197 --> 00:29:21,133
It's time for children to go home.

296
1213
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:23,401
Go home. You'll get hurt.

297
1217
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:27,306
It's gotten a little noisy. Sorry.

298
1221
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,424
Miss, Are you alright?

299
1225
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:21,027
Thanks for helping me.

300
1229
00:30:22,728 --> 00:30:25,000
Ow . . . ouch!

301
1233
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,833
Those idiots!

302
1237
00:30:30,553 --> 00:30:32,839
If that had been all, it would've been all right.

303
1241
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,674
There's still more?

304
1245
00:30:34,674 --> 00:30:37,910
Don't even go there.  That girl is a real monster!

305
1249
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:53,125
<i>âª  I want nobody..nobody but you</i>

306
1253
00:32:00,258 --> 00:32:04,297
I've seen plenty of girls in my day, but that's the first time I've ever experienced that kind.

307
1257
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,198
Then what are we going to do now?

308
1261
00:32:06,198 --> 00:32:09,035
That unni, she's close with us too.

309
1265
00:32:09,035 --> 00:32:12,738
We have no other choice but to use our last resort emergency plan.

310
1269
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:14,973
Emergency plan?

311
1273
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:19,678
We'll give up on the monkey girl, and worry about getting the two idiots back together.

312
1277
00:32:19,678 --> 00:32:21,681
The two idiots?

313
1281
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,252
So that's why I'm saying...

314
1285
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:31,958
Ga Eul, you're going to have to help us.

315
1289
00:33:19,434 --> 00:33:21,993
<i>I was the one that killed them.</i>

316
1293
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:30,882
<i>I was the one who turned him into an orphan.</i>

317
1297
00:33:30,882 --> 00:33:33,149
<i>It's all my fault...</i>

318
1301
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:05,599
Hello.  What?!  You and Yi Jung sunbae are doing what?

319
1305
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:08,153
DATE.

320
1309
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,939
No, you can't. You can't, Ga Eul.

321
1313
00:34:12,939 --> 00:34:16,642
Why?  Yi Jung sunbae's not a bad person.

322
1317
00:34:16,642 --> 00:34:22,659
Uh, that is... he's not bad.

323
1321
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:25,188
He's not a bad person, but,

324
1325
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,344
That person is F4's biggest...

325
1329
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:29,647
Biggest?

326
1333
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:32,328
In any case, Ga Eul!

327
1337
00:34:32,328 --> 00:34:37,104
It would be a good idea to really think this over.

328
1341
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:40,500
I don't know.  He said he's picking me up early tomorrow.

329
1345
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,097
So I'm going to bed early, though I don't know if I'll be able to sleep.

330
1349
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:47,441
Goodnight, Jan Di.  Bye.

331
1353
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,844
err...Ga Eul..

332
1357
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:01,221
So Yi Jung??

333
1361
00:35:02,623 --> 00:35:03,690
So Yi Jung...

334
1365
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,580
So Yi Jung?!?

335
1369
00:35:25,138 --> 00:35:28,740
Ji Hoo sunbae, answer your phone!  Please!

336
1373
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:34,435
<i>- The number you have called cannot answer... -</i>

337
1377
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:49,886
Ga Eul,

338
1381
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:51,371
how are you?

339
1385
00:35:51,371 --> 00:35:56,012
No way, no way.  NO WAY!

340
1389
00:36:01,781 --> 00:36:04,724
Yo! Geum Jan Di, what's up?

341
1393
00:36:04,724 --> 00:36:07,821
Sunbae, Goo Joon Pyo, where is Goo Joon Pyo?

342
1397
00:36:14,828 --> 00:36:15,604
Goo Joon Pyo!

343
1401
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:19,299
Hey!

344
1405
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:29,692
- Ah, Sunbae! 
- You asked where he was,
 you didn't ask what he was doing.

345
1411
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:33,213
Ahhh! 
 What the hell's with you?

346
1416
00:36:37,517 --> 00:36:42,422
Goo Joon Pyo, help me.  There's big trouble!

347
1420
00:36:42,422 --> 00:36:43,436
Big trouble?

348
1424
00:36:43,436 --> 00:36:45,136
It's out of my control.

349
1428
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,402
I don't have any money or a car.

350
1432
00:36:47,402 --> 00:36:49,537
What if something happens?

351
1436
00:36:49,537 --> 00:36:51,862
Something happens?  What will happen?

352
1440
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:56,803
What happens if they end up at a hotel?

353
1444
00:36:56,803 --> 00:36:59,673
Hotel?

354
1448
00:36:59,673 --> 00:37:03,676
Geum Jan Di, I know you've gotten a shock because of that Monkey, but...

355
1452
00:37:03,676 --> 00:37:05,911
Why are you doing things you don't usually do?

356
1456
00:37:05,911 --> 00:37:08,782
Yi Jung sunbae says he's going on a date with Ga Eul.

357
1460
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:17,857
Now that I think about it, Yi Jung did mention a girl he was stuck on.

358
1464
00:37:17,857 --> 00:37:20,693
I wonder how long Ga Eul will last?

359
1468
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:25,832
Two days?  No, it may only take him one day to finish her off.

360
1472
00:37:25,832 --> 00:37:27,468
O... One day?

361
1476
00:37:27,468 --> 00:37:31,538
Geum Jan Di, don't you know what Yi Jung's nickname is? "5 second Kill."

362
1480
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:34,007
"5 seconds Kill?"

363
1484
00:37:36,075 --> 00:37:36,845
One.                .

364
1488
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:40,515
Two.

365
1492
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:42,783
Three.

366
1496
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:46,653
Four.

367
1500
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:52,125
Five

368
1504
00:38:16,015 --> 00:38:17,016
<i>Ga Eul..</i>

369
1508
00:38:29,978 --> 00:38:32,930
No way... No way!!!

370
1512
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,536
Has Yi Jung taken drugs??

371
1516
00:38:36,536 --> 00:38:37,838
To date Ga Eul . . .

372
1520
00:38:39,172 --> 00:38:40,141
What is that supposed to mean?

373
1524
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:43,910
Honestly speaking, Ga Eul isn't Yi Jung's type.

374
1528
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:49,716
Yi Jung never dates anyone unless theis body is better than Lee Hyori and their face is better than Kim Tae Hee.

375
1532
00:38:50,984 --> 00:38:53,319
With Ga Eul?

376
1536
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:55,922
Leave them in an empty room together for 3 nights and 4 days.

377
1540
00:38:55,922 --> 00:38:57,223
See if anything happens.

378
1544
00:38:57,223 --> 00:38:59,992
No, he actually said

379
1548
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:02,596
that something about Ga Eul was really cute.

380
1552
00:39:04,364 --> 00:39:07,300
See!  Now what are we going to do?

381
1556
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,868
What are we going to do?

382
1560
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,504
So, what do you want me to do?

383
1564
00:39:11,618 --> 00:39:13,173
Come here.

384
1568
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:15,208
Give me your ear.

385
1572
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:22,916
- I don't know. 
- Why?

386
1577
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:33,593
Oh.  He's here.

387
1581
00:39:52,712 --> 00:39:54,781
Are you ready?

388
1585
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:02,188
- Yes. 
 - You and I are both suffering because of our idiot friends.

389
1590
00:40:04,123 --> 00:40:06,226
Do you think we can pull it off without getting caught?

390
1594
00:40:07,894 --> 00:40:12,231
Don't worry. Just follow my lead.

391
1598
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:15,435
We've already done this acting thing together once before.

392
1602
00:40:28,014 --> 00:40:29,850
Hey. Get down!

393
1606
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:33,753
Don't be nervous.

394
1610
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:43,031
Hey, start the car.  Fast, fast!   Start.

395
1614
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:44,130
Ah! Really!

396
1618
00:40:48,101 --> 00:40:48,935
Okay.

397
1622
00:40:48,935 --> 00:40:50,537
Let's go.

398
1626
00:42:26,499 --> 00:42:31,004
Grandfather probably still hates me.

399
1630
00:42:34,674 --> 00:42:40,046
All the people I love always end up leaving me behind.

400
1634
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:46,419
I tried to live as though I didn't need anyone, but...

401
1638
00:42:51,823 --> 00:42:54,127
I keep wanting to hold on to everyone.

402
1642
00:42:56,162 --> 00:42:57,564
What should I do?

403
1646
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:17,636
It's been hard, hasn't it?

404
1650
00:44:17,636 --> 00:44:20,022
No, it's been fun.

405
1654
00:44:34,436 --> 00:44:38,684
Who wouldn't mistake him for a player?

406
1658
00:44:38,684 --> 00:44:42,200
Yi Jung Sunbae is ridiculous.

407
1662
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:46,423
So would you rather he didn't care

408
1666
00:44:46,423 --> 00:44:48,095
whether she froze to death or not?

409
1670
00:44:49,627 --> 00:44:52,048
Well, no, it's not that.

410
1674
00:44:53,766 --> 00:44:55,548
Look at your lips turning blue.

411
1678
00:44:56,698 --> 00:44:58,839
You'd probably freeze before your friend.

412
1682
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,278
Come here.

413
1686
00:45:06,563 --> 00:45:09,458
- Hey, what are you doi...? 
- Just stay still.

414
1691
00:45:24,735 --> 00:45:28,019
I'm o, okay.

415
1695
00:45:38,606 --> 00:45:41,893
Look. I told you this would work.

416
1699
00:45:41,893 --> 00:45:44,117
Yeah.

417
1703
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:46,827
Then, should we slowly lead up to the climax?

418
1707
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,821
Eh?

419
1711
00:46:06,408 --> 00:46:07,477
Are you ready?

420
1715
00:46:20,866 --> 00:46:27,721
How is it that you guys can make a fireworks display
look as simple as setting off a kid's firecracker?

421
1720
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:32,132
That rascal, he sure is cool.

422
1724
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,504
Was it that cool when I did that?

423
1728
00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:43,911
But...

424
1732
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:49,664
What was the last thing Yi Jung said?

425
1736
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:56,756
What do you mean?  There's only one thing he could have said in that situation.

426
1740
00:46:56,756 --> 00:46:58,291
What's that?

427
1744
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,408
Should we go up?

428
1748
00:47:03,748 --> 00:47:05,181
Go up where?

429
1752
00:47:14,715 --> 00:47:17,844
No way. No way!

430
1756
00:47:19,052 --> 00:47:22,682
Though he's my friend, he sure is a real player.

431
1760
00:47:23,316 --> 00:47:26,313
How could he bring her to a hotel?

432
1764
00:47:26,313 --> 00:47:28,900
I was wondering why he took her skating.

433
1768
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,329
Wow. I didn't know there was a deeper meaning behind it.

434
1772
00:47:31,329 --> 00:47:32,492
Be quiet!

435
1776
00:47:32,492 --> 00:47:34,394
I can't hear anything.

436
1780
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:37,197
Do you know how many stars this hotel has?  Do really think you'll be able to hear anything?

437
1784
00:47:37,197 --> 00:47:38,261
Then what should I do?

438
1788
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:40,314
Why don't you go outside and stand guard.

439
1792
00:47:41,203 --> 00:47:43,006
Oh, that's right.

440
1796
00:47:45,304 --> 00:47:46,373
Hey!

441
1800
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:56,116
Goo Joon Pyo! Goo Joon Pyo!

442
1804
00:47:56,116 --> 00:47:57,650
What's wrong?

443
1808
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,119
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

444
1812
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:11,798
Oh my god! Yi Jung Sunbae must have prepared that.

445
1816
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:13,783
Hey, do something!

446
1820
00:48:15,168 --> 00:48:16,369
What?

447
1824
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:21,954
That's the mark of a player, we can't let that go in that room.

448
1828
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:25,811
Hey, let's go bring that here.

449
1832
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:28,250
- What? 
 - Hurry! Hurry!

450
1837
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,051
Ah, really!

451
1841
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:41,761
Hurry! Go! I said go!

452
1845
00:49:02,414 --> 00:49:03,182
Thank you.

453
1849
00:49:18,464 --> 00:49:19,666
It's a complete success.

454
1853
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:23,069
Will everything be all right?

455
1857
00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:26,739
I'm not sure. As a couple, they have so much going against them...

456
1861
00:49:27,207 --> 00:49:30,242
We've done all we could, so we'll just have to wait and see.

457
1865
00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:32,879
You did great today, Ga Eul.

458
1869
00:49:39,085 --> 00:49:40,553
Oh, Woo Bin.

459
1873
00:49:40,954 --> 00:49:44,190
We're about to finish up here.

460
1877
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,859
Okay.

461
1881
00:50:17,523 --> 00:50:19,392
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

462
1886
00:50:23,543 --> 00:50:26,799
Though it's late, Happy Birthday.

463
1890
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:31,938
Though it's late, thanks for the present.

464
1894
00:50:33,439 --> 00:50:35,375
You got my gift?

465
1898
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:38,378
That was the first time I've ever received such a crappy gift.

466
1902
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:42,048
But I'll accept it because it's the thought that counts.

467
1906
00:50:49,824 --> 00:50:53,159
Though it's late . . .

468
1910
00:50:54,909 --> 00:50:56,663
Congratulations on your engagement.

469
1914
00:50:56,663 --> 00:50:58,431
I told you to stop thinking about that!

470
1918
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:02,335
Jae Kyung Unni is a good person.

471
1922
00:51:02,335 --> 00:51:03,503
Unni?

472
1926
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:08,408
She really,

473
1930
00:51:10,209 --> 00:51:12,912
really likes you a lot.

474
1934
00:51:19,018 --> 00:51:21,254
You're still as nosy as ever!

475
1938
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:24,657
That's right.

476
1942
00:51:24,657 --> 00:51:27,827
If you didn't drive me crazy, then you wouldn't be Geum Jan Di.

477
1946
00:51:30,896 --> 00:51:31,931
So . . .

478
1950
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:36,402
would you be happy if I just gave up and got married tomorrow?

479
1954
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:39,405
Would that make you feel better?

480
1958
00:51:45,044 --> 00:51:51,017
Ah, what is that girl doing?

481
1962
00:51:52,038 --> 00:51:54,321
I'm going to go out for a little bit.

482
1966
00:51:55,789 --> 00:51:57,624
This girl...

483
1970
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:19,412
Everything is going well, right?

484
1974
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:21,981
Yes, everything is going just fine.

485
1978
00:52:21,981 --> 00:52:25,718
By the way, Joon Pyo is currently in a hotel room.

486
1982
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:31,624
Joon Pyo's in the hotel right now?

487
1986
00:52:31,624 --> 00:52:32,658
Yes.

488
1990
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,137
What is this?

489
1994
00:52:44,137 --> 00:52:46,739
Why can't I hear anything?

490
1998
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,576
They can't be...

491
2002
00:52:54,513 --> 00:52:55,348
You there!

492
2006
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,456
What are you doing here?

493
2010
00:53:04,657 --> 00:53:06,159
H-Hello.

494
2014
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:11,998
You really are a girl I can't let slide.

495
2018
00:53:11,998 --> 00:53:16,403
Or are you finally showing your true colors?

496
2022
00:53:21,006 --> 00:53:27,647
This is why I was careful from the start in preventing him from hanging around with kids from trashy families.

497
2026
00:53:28,882 --> 00:53:32,285
Your words are a little harsh.

498
2030
00:53:32,285 --> 00:53:36,089
My family is not trashy.

499
2034
00:53:37,824 --> 00:53:43,363
If a still wet-behind-the-ears girl who follows a boy into a hotel, isn't trashy, then...

500
2038
00:53:43,363 --> 00:53:44,764
Hey, Geum Jan Di! You!

501
2042
00:53:55,474 --> 00:53:56,509
Why?

502
2046
00:53:56,509 --> 00:54:02,048
Did Joon Pyo's engagement make you nervous?
Is that why you thought you'd try to throw yourself at him?

503
2051
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,320
You rude, awful girl! 
Stop it!

504
2056
00:54:10,387 --> 00:54:12,524
Please.

505
2060
00:54:12,524 --> 00:54:14,462
Stop.

506
2064
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,550
Get Joon Pyo out of here.

507
2068
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,473
Young Master.

508
2072
00:55:38,981 --> 00:55:40,876
Let's go, Young Master.

509
2076
00:55:55,086 --> 00:55:56,562

<i>Message sent to Yoon Ji Hoo.</i>

514
2096
00:57:07,972 --> 00:57:09,431
Hello?

515
2100
00:57:09,431 --> 00:57:10,593
Where are you?

516
2104
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,316
Ah, I'm at home.

517
2108
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:16,652
Is anything wrong?

518
2112
00:57:16,652 --> 00:57:19,217
What do you mean?
There's nothing wrong.

519
2117
00:57:21,463 --> 00:57:25,836
Okay.

520
2121
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:53,110
S-Sun-Sunbae.

521
2125
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:59,698
I see this has become Geum Jan Di's house.

522
2129
00:59:03,441 --> 00:59:12,232
I couldn't sleep, so I came out to get some air and to study. So...

523
2133
01:01:41,081 --> 01:01:42,349
Yeah, mom?

524
2137
01:01:43,781 --> 01:01:45,549
What's wrong?

525
2141
01:01:47,395 --> 01:01:48,688
Mom!

526
2145
01:01:49,286 --> 01:01:51,575
Was there some kind of accident?

527
2149
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:53,147
Mom!

528
2153
01:01:53,147 --> 01:01:55,253
MOM!

529
2157
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:00,129
What's happening?

530
2161
01:02:31,527 --> 01:02:34,163
Honey.

531
2165
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:38,469
Look at that.

532
2169
01:02:38,469 --> 01:02:41,247
If you have any eyes, just look.

533
2173
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:45,176
What are we going to do from now on?

534
2177
01:02:45,176 --> 01:02:49,513
It's hard enough paying the interest with what we're making now.

535
2181
01:02:49,513 --> 01:02:53,754
How could you think about vouching for someone's debt ?

536
2185
01:02:53,754 --> 01:02:55,135
That is . . .

537
2189
01:02:55,135 --> 01:02:59,345
Long before our situation became like this, a friend asked to just borrow my name.

538
2193
01:02:59,345 --> 01:03:00,725
Just your name?

539
2197
01:03:00,725 --> 01:03:04,763
With just your name, how could these red tags... (repossessions)

540
2201
01:03:04,763 --> 01:03:06,163
Oh honey!

541
2205
01:03:06,263 --> 01:03:10,532
Oh, headache! headache!

542
2209
01:03:12,936 --> 01:03:15,171
Hello?

543
2213
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:22,793
Yes, this is Mr. Geum Il Bong and Mrs. Na Gong Ju's residence.

544
2217
01:03:22,835 --> 01:03:25,662
The Art Center?

545
2221
01:03:31,555 --> 01:03:39,027
I'm sorry, but my parents have been ill lately.

546
2225
01:03:39,396 --> 01:03:43,433
Could I do it in their place?

547
2229
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:49,139
What I'm saying is that it puts me in a tight spot if they don't come back to work soon.

548
2233
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:51,040
I'm sorry.

549
2237
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,944
I'll do everything that's been needing to be done.

550
2241
01:03:55,445 --> 01:04:00,150
Can't you let this go until they get better?

551
2245
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,389
I'm letting this go because even though you're little, you're so earnest.

552
2249
01:04:05,289 --> 01:04:08,719
Then, I'm trusting you.

553
2253
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,119
Thank you.

554
2257
01:04:11,961 --> 01:04:15,563
Thank you!
