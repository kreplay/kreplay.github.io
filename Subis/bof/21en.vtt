3
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:58,827
Master..Time to wake up..Master!

2
7
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,923
Time to wake up now.

3
11
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:04,025
Sir..

4
15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,276
Master....MASTER!

5
19
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:10,072
You have to wake up ma-

6
23
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:13,050
You! What are you..

7
27
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,507
Five minutes... 
Let's stay like this... just for five minutes.

8
32
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:27,640
Even though I am holding you like this,
 I still can't believe you are here in front of me.

9
37
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:39,250
Hey Joon, I'm here!

10
41
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,771
Lets..

11
45
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,269
Jan Di..

12
49
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,393
How did this happen?

13
53
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,807
That...I---

14
57
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:05,460
Jae Kyung?

15
61
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,712
It's not easy to wake up our Joon Pyo,

16
65
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,135
but it seems like you've already...

17
69
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,860
What? You?

18
73
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,200
Why are you here in those clothes?

19
77
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,292
Tell me? Who did this?

20
81
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,367
Who is the one who brought you into this house!?!

21
85
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,200
It was me!

22
89
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:47,365
Grandmother!

23
93
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:52,340
Grandmother why are you here??

24
97
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,249
Long time no see, mistress...

25
101
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:58,101
No, I shall call you President Kang now.

26
105
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:00,560
I still need to get used to it.

27
109
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:02,440
What is going on?

28
113
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,344
I hope you didn't forget.

29
117
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:12,000
The late president has left it in his will that my right and duty in house is tenured.

30
121
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,571
Even you, mistress, cannot undo that promise.

31
125
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:22,060
I don't care that you are in this house, but what about that child?

32
129
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,200
I cannot accept that she set foot in this house even for a moment.

33
133
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,262
Take her away immediately!

34
137
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:29,080
I can't do that.

35
141
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,962
Grandma!

36
145
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:33,200
I hired her out of my will,

37
149
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,640
so I can fire her when I will it.

38
153
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:41,238
I think this is no business of yours, mistress.

39
157
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:46,453
Moreover, she lacks experience as a maid.

40
161
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:50,560
That's why it is not time for her to leave.

41
165
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,740
If I let her leave without proper education,

42
169
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,894
what would people say about me and this household?

43
173
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:01,683
Grandmother!

44
177
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,864
What are you doing?

45
181
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:07,880
Jan Di follow me. We have a lot of work to do!

46
185
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,565
Yes,

47
189
00:04:10,565 --> 00:04:11,440
sunbaenim!

48
193
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:45,520
Thank you.

49
197
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,888
I didn't purposefully do it for your gratitude,

50
201
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:56,096
so don't misunderstand.
 What?

51
206
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,784
I didn't do it just for Jun Hee's request.

52
210
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:09,384
While I've been away from here,

53
214
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:16,780
I was worried about Master Jun Pyo. He's a child at heart and a sensitive one at that.

54
218
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,442
I knew that there will be a point when he'd snap.

55
222
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:27,574
I think Seo Hyun had told me something similar before.

56
226
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,900
But Master Jun Pyo's different now

57
230
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,200
and I think it's because of you.

58
234
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:42,200
I have a great debt to this household.

59
238
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:50,536
I believe that the last thing I have to do before I die 
 is to make sure that Master Joon Pyo will lead his life the right way.

60
243
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,129
I prided myself on my talent in judging people,

61
247
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:01,640
so I'm going to trust myself again.

62
251
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:07,332
Sunbae..

63
255
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:31,652
Don't you think..we should talk?

64
259
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,072
It's pretty.

65
263
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,820
I didn't know a maid uniform could look so pretty.

66
267
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,360
Jae Kyung.. I...

67
271
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,260
I know. It was probably too hard to tell me.

68
275
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:06,020
I know your situation. When I think about it, I can understand why you did what you did.

69
279
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm sorry.

70
283
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:11,654
But still,

71
287
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:15,878
before I was Joon Pyo's fiancee, wasn't I your friend first?

72
291
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,760
It would have been nice if you discussed it with your friend first.

73
295
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,002
I'm sorry.

74
299
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,160
But please don't misunderstand.

75
303
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,487
I won't misunderstand.

76
307
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:33,380
But I do have something to say.

77
311
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,800
I'm not going to give up on Joon Pyo.

78
315
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,802
No.
 I'm going to try even harder from now on.

79
320
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,896
I'm going to do my best without any regrets

80
324
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:59,659
I just.
I just wanted to tell you that, Jan Di.

81
329
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,282
I'm going.

82
333
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:32,460
Yes.

83
337
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,280
Jae Kyung.

84
341
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:45,720
Please don't misunderstand this situation.

85
345
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:48,281
As you saw....

86
349
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:50,920
those were Grandma's doings.

87
353
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:54,359
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

88
357
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,187
Thank you.
 That's why I approve of you, Jae Kyung.

89
362
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:04,360
I will get rid of that girl (Jan Di) today.

90
366
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,000
Please, don't do that.

91
370
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,160
What?

92
374
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,600
Jan Di, I think you should just leave her as she is.

93
378
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,120
Jae Kyung.

94
382
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,799
And also..I have another thing to request.

95
386
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:25,460
We're done for today.

96
390
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,760
Thank you, everyone.

97
394
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,000
Goodbye...

98
398
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:46,840
Why? Ga Eul, do you have something to say to me?

99
402
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:49,880
Ah..No...

100
406
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:53,160
Teacher Eun Jae-nim.

101
410
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:59,920
How did you and he separate?

102
414
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,860
It's me.  I'm on my way now.

103
418
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,040
All right.  You better not eat it all without me,

104
422
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,440
or else I'll be really mad.

105
426
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:52,240
I don't want to do it...

106
430
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Okay, okay fine. One time.

107
434
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,626
I'll teach  you.

108
438
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:22,438
Hello? Yi Jung.

109
442
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,819
Mmm. How are you ?

110
446
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,140
<i>I'm great. Hey you. Don't you want to see your older brother?</i>

111
450
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,820
<i>I know you're busy and all, but it'd be nice to see your face once in a while.</i>

112
454
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:37,070
I'm sorry.

113
458
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,600
It sounds like you're in a good mood.

114
462
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,971
I am. If you're curious, stop by. I have someone to show you. And stories to tell, too.

115
466
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:57,096
Someone to show me ?

116
470
00:12:57,947 --> 00:13:00,240
You'll probably be really shocked to see her.

117
474
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,450
<i>And happy, too! I can't wait till you meet her, little bro!</i>

118
478
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:10,999
Hyung.. <i>
 Yeah?</i>

119
483
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:25,775
You're... happy, right?

120
487
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:31,767
Yeah. I'm sorry I'm happy by myself.

121
491
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:41,874
Yi Jung?

122
495
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,287
Yi Jung?

123
499
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:41,054
Hey Monkey..

124
503
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,294
What is all this ?

125
507
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:47,242
Hello everyone !

126
511
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm Ha Jae Kyung. I'll be staying in this house from now on for pre-marriage preparations.

127
515
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,040
What?

128
519
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,060
- Madam Chairman
- Is it ready?

129
524
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,434
What is this about?

130
528
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:03,995
After discussing with Jae Kyung's parents, we thought it'd be a good idea to push up the wedding date.

131
532
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:08,501
You are both adults, and it'd be best for both of our businesses

132
536
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:14,577
to continue on with the partnership if you two are already married.

133
540
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:16,880
How can you do this without our consent ?

134
544
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,176
I agreed with them.

135
548
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,226
What?

136
552
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:26,120
Jae Kyung will stay at our house until the wedding day.

137
556
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,992
She wanted to get adjusted to the air,

138
560
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:31,202
and get ready to be your wife.

139
564
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:33,770
The thought was so sweet

140
568
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,360
that her parents and I both approved.

141
572
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,369
Also?

142
576
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:40,331
Yes..

143
580
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:47,600
The two 'to-be-married' will have to shoot the Shin Hwa phone commercial together.

144
584
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,542
What ?

145
588
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,794
Who agreed to that?

146
592
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:54,640
The two of you together at the phone launching

147
596
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,660
were so lovely

148
600
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,392
that you two became a hot topic on the internet and magazines.

149
604
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:03,174
The marketing team decided that you two

150
608
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:09,392
could only be the best choice to advertise the phone.

151
612
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,278
Jae Kyung, I'm sorry to have to make you work, but you could help us out, right ?

152
616
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:16,655
Of course. It's my honor.

153
620
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,760
I... I can't accept this!

154
624
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:21,200
Jun Pyo..

155
628
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,394
Give and take.

156
632
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:27,600
You haven't forgotten the basics of business, right ?

157
636
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,480
<i>Can you come to my room for a bit? 
 - Jaekyung</i>

158
641
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,204
How do I look?

159
645
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:05,667
Pretty..

160
649
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:08,460
It's really pretty.

161
653
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,940
Jun Pyo's mother gave me this.

162
657
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,127
It's over 20 years old, but I think it'll still work.

163
661
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,920
I might just wear this.

164
665
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,020
Wait... look at this too.

165
669
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,624
She says she won't give me the pearls yet.

166
673
00:19:31,624 --> 00:19:34,040
She told me she'd give them to me when we have our first kid.

167
677
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,131
Don't you think she's getting a little ahead of herself?

168
681
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:38,503
But it's pretty funny to think about...

169
685
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:41,368
A kid that looks like Goo Joon Pyo and Ha Jae Kyung.

170
689
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:45,866
Jan Di..

171
693
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,628
I have a request.

172
697
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:50,820
What is it?

173
701
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,337
You have to promise me that you'll do it, first.

174
705
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:01,749
Be my maid of honor.

175
709
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:05,035
What?

176
713
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:06,746
It can't be anyone else.

177
717
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:08,671
It has to be Jan Di.

178
721
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:11,362
You'll do it, right ? Hmm ?

179
725
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,540
Action, take one.

180
729
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:51,750
You can't use those in the winter.

181
733
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,030
Use worms.

182
737
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:13,840
It's served me well over the years.Take it.

183
741
00:22:19,753 --> 00:22:20,859
Do you want to come?

184
745
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:31,315
I'll leave in ten minutes.

185
749
00:22:40,697 --> 00:22:44,080
Hey, Ji....oh, wait...

186
753
00:22:57,046 --> 00:23:02,183
Your mom made one mean spicy fish stew.

187
757
00:23:10,215 --> 00:23:16,132
Today is their wedding anniversary.

188
761
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:37,790
I still remember very clearly...

189
765
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,992
giving that to your grandmother and putting it on.

190
769
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:44,893
Her smile was so bright,

191
773
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:51,763
I asked what was so great about receiving that old cheap ring.

192
777
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:59,521
She said, "It's the only one in the world. Why wouldn't I be happy?"

193
781
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:05,477
Child...

194
785
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:10,101
I'm sorry.

195
789
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:16,005
I took away that kind of a mother from you.

196
793
00:24:18,394 --> 00:24:21,870
All because of my karma.

197
797
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:48,736
What are you planning on doing?

198
801
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:51,557
I don't know either.

199
805
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:56,233
It feels like a bomb went off in my head and everything is scrambled.

200
809
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,237
What should I do?

201
813
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,163
What is it that I can do?

202
817
00:25:02,163 --> 00:25:03,809
You have to find a way.

203
821
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:08,590
Only you can find a solution.

204
825
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:13,431
If this was like the past

205
829
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:17,210
The solution of course would be to marry her.

206
833
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,410
How is it that we have become ones who

207
837
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,790
question, and worry about, our definite solution?

208
841
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:43,358
It looks like we're going to end up being groomsmen.

209
845
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:07,710
Are you okay?

210
849
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,190
About what?

211
853
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,048
You know what.

212
857
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:14,313
Jan Di, this time it's a real marriage.

213
861
00:26:14,313 --> 00:26:20,112
You know that marriage is different from dating for a few days and breaking up.

214
865
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:39,051
That's the future of those two people.

215
869
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,283
And that's the place Jun Pyo's supposed to fill.

216
873
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,952
Hi, mom and dad. You guys are doing well, right?

217
877
00:26:55,952 --> 00:26:57,102
San too?

218
881
00:26:58,656 --> 00:26:59,550
What?!

219
885
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,554
You should be eating well! What are you going to do getting sick?!

220
889
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,623
Don't worry about me.

221
893
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:19,350
Please take care of your health.

222
897
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,295
Don't be so frugal and cheap either...

223
901
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:26,190
Buy and eat some meat, too.

224
905
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,310
Understand?

225
909
00:27:31,662 --> 00:27:33,030
Okay.

226
913
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,030
Yes, grandfather?

227
917
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,870
Right now?

228
921
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:16,870
Oh, I'm sor-

229
925
00:28:19,979 --> 00:28:21,590
What's going on?

230
929
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,246
Sunbae - why are you here?

231
933
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,223
Me? Grandfat-

232
937
00:28:26,223 --> 00:28:27,642
Me too.

233
941
00:29:45,212 --> 00:29:47,150
Excuse me. What are they doing?

234
945
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,390
The Couple Wedding Contest.

235
949
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,180
They said they'd give you a prize if you win.

236
953
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,205
You can also wear a wedding dress for free.

237
957
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:58,183
Prize?

238
961
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:11,374
<i>I said to take care of your health.</i>

239
965
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,920
<i>Don't try saving money.</i>

240
969
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,487
<i>Eat some meat too.</i>

241
973
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:27,027
1st Prize: Jeju Island Travel Tickets 
 2nd Prize: Korean Beef set, 3rd Prize: Ance Treatment

242
978
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:30,130
We're bored. Want to give it a try?

243
982
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:31,854
What?

244
986
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:32,978
Let's go.

245
990
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:22,192
Please smile and make a pose.

246
994
00:31:22,192 --> 00:31:24,465
Okay. One, two...

247
998
00:31:36,037 --> 00:31:37,110
Okay, next couple.

248
1002
00:31:40,086 --> 00:31:43,639
Okay. One...Move a little closer.

249
1006
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:45,990
Make it more natural.

250
1010
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:58,070
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

251
1014
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,486
Ah, Sunbae...

252
1018
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:48,470
Excuse me, but this is a plane ticket to Jeju Island. Would you mind exchanging gifts?

253
1022
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,572
Not at all.

254
1026
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:50,870
Thank you.

255
1030
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,315
Please take it.

256
1034
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:53,590
Thank you.

257
1038
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,192
Here.

258
1042
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:01,667
SUNBAE!!!

259
1046
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,306
Thank you. Thank you.

260
1050
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:11,386
Thank you..Thank you.

261
1054
00:34:58,093 --> 00:35:03,499
Dear Passengers, we will be arriving shortly at Jeju International Airport.

262
1058
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:08,816
Please stow away your tray tables and fasten your seatbelts.

263
1062
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:34,184
Are you okay?

264
1066
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,059
So, days like this really do come, huh?

265
1070
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,629
Jan Di came with us.

266
1074
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:45,192
Does any of this makes sense?

267
1078
00:36:45,192 --> 00:36:48,807
Whether the monkey asked her to be the maid of honor...

268
1082
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,905
or the girl that accepted it.

269
1086
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:56,544
Who do you think is having the hardest time right now?

270
1090
00:37:26,741 --> 00:37:27,839
Jan Di,

271
1094
00:37:30,112 --> 00:37:32,080
You came

272
1098
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,128
You really came..

273
1102
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,008
Thank you.

274
1106
00:37:52,334 --> 00:38:00,754
I know that  you and Joon Pyo really like each other.

275
1110
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,747
Jae Kyung..

276
1114
00:38:07,164 --> 00:38:16,157
Wait no.. 
Even right now. . .
I don't know if you still like each other...

277
1120
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,943
I'm sorry I pretended to not know.

278
1124
00:38:27,547 --> 00:38:30,304
I'm not usually like this.

279
1128
00:38:31,806 --> 00:38:34,709
I was a little disloyal and cowardly towards you.

280
1132
00:38:35,758 --> 00:38:36,477
No..

281
1136
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:43,518
It was because I didn't come out honestly and tell you.

282
1140
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,319
You're right..

283
1144
00:38:45,754 --> 00:38:49,056
It wasn't that you didn't want to, it was because you couldn't.

284
1148
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:52,607
And..

285
1152
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:55,963
even if you had told me,

286
1156
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:58,299
I'm sure nothing would have changed.

287
1160
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:05,276
I...  wouldn't have given up on Joon Pyo.

288
1164
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:20,454
I really do like you a lot.

289
1168
00:39:22,357 --> 00:39:27,461
If someone told me to pick the two most precious people in the world to me,

290
1172
00:39:28,973 --> 00:39:32,078
I would say Goo Joon Pyo and Geum Jan Di.

291
1176
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,434
Jae Kyung..

292
1180
00:39:34,536 --> 00:39:38,840
Therefore, I'm really sorry.

293
1184
00:39:40,673 --> 00:39:46,158
Because I made your heartache. 
but I'll make it up to you somehow.

294
1189
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:50,151
Please forgive me.

295
1193
00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:30,674
Hey, Joon Pyo!

296
1197
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:33,652
Stop playing and come here.

297
1201
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:35,656
You're going to faint that way.

298
1205
00:41:35,656 --> 00:41:37,959
He actually might be trying to faint.

299
1209
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:39,927
Are we really supposed to let him do that?

300
1213
00:41:57,712 --> 00:42:00,848
<i>How did you end up breaking up with him?</i>

301
1217
00:42:01,482 --> 00:42:03,417
<i>Who knows...</i>

302
1221
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:05,919
<i>How did we break up?</i>

303
1225
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:10,324
<i>You asked if I confessed, right?</i>

304
1229
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:14,161
<i>I did confess.</i>

305
1233
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,433
<i>Just once...</i>

306
1237
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:20,634
<i>I gathered up all my courage for 10 years worth of feelings</i>

307
1241
00:42:20,634 --> 00:42:23,937
<i>that i had been carrying around.</i>

308
1245
00:42:23,937 --> 00:42:26,334
<i>It was on Valentine's day.</i>

309
1249
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:32,680
<i>Believing that if we were destined, that how I truly felt would be understood,</i>

310
1253
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,350
<i>I put everything on the line.</i>

311
1257
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:41,722
<i>So how did it turn out?</i>

312
1261
00:42:41,722 --> 00:42:45,826
<i>I wasn't able to get it through to that person.</i>

313
1265
00:42:45,826 --> 00:42:49,330
<i>My feelings, that is.</i>

314
1269
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,065
<i>The amazing thing is.</i>

315
1273
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:55,269
<i> After I did that,
my heart was completely emptied.</i>

316
1278
00:42:56,137 --> 00:42:58,406
<i>Just like how the low tide drifts away.</i>

317
1282
00:43:00,174 --> 00:43:02,743
<i>I thought... Alright, it's up to this point.</i>

318
1286
00:43:03,877 --> 00:43:08,983
<i>As I felt us being combed through, it was almost to the point where I felt like I could almost touch that feeling.</i>

319
1290
00:43:10,218 --> 00:43:14,455
<i>It felt like solving a math problem that I had been working on for a very long time.</i>

320
1294
00:43:14,889 --> 00:43:16,457
<i>I felt it was for the better.</i>

321
1298
00:43:16,457 --> 00:43:18,207
<i>And it didn't hurt afterwards?</i>

322
1302
00:43:18,207 --> 00:43:20,994
<i>I've done everything I could, without any regrets.</i>

323
1306
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:22,830
<i>so it didn't really hurt.</i>

324
1310
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:30,104
<i>So Ga Eul, keep trying until you have no regrets.</i>

325
1314
00:43:33,274 --> 00:43:35,711
Isn't the situation too serious

326
1318
00:43:35,711 --> 00:43:37,912
for you to be playing in the flower field?

327
1322
00:43:47,516 --> 00:43:51,810
At this age, a marriage of convenience.

328
1326
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,013
It doesn't seem real.

329
1330
00:43:54,013 --> 00:43:56,250
In our world,

330
1334
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,939
it's not something to be surprised by.

331
1338
00:43:58,854 --> 00:44:00,401
Sunbae too...

332
1342
00:44:00,401 --> 00:44:03,237
Do you accept this kind of future as well?

333
1346
00:44:03,237 --> 00:44:05,371
Who knows.

334
1350
00:44:05,371 --> 00:44:07,905
Whether it's this kind of future or that kind of future.

335
1354
00:44:07,905 --> 00:44:10,110
Neither one looks too different from the other.

336
1358
00:44:11,036 --> 00:44:14,884
How can  you be so irresponsible about your one and only life?

337
1362
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:18,550
Because you're like this, no one can stay by your side.

338
1366
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:24,491
Now that you know about my family and my weaknesses,

339
1370
00:44:24,491 --> 00:44:27,014
is that why you're acting as if you knew everything?

340
1374
00:44:31,481 --> 00:44:33,200
Why on earth didn't you go to see her?

341
1378
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:41,808
On the Valentine day 3 years ago.

342
1382
00:45:16,577 --> 00:45:20,014
It's getting cold. We should go inside.

343
1386
00:45:40,668 --> 00:45:43,056
Today might be your last chance.

344
1390
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:45,563
Joon Pyo.

345
1394
00:45:48,075 --> 00:45:49,434
If you want to hang onto him,

346
1398
00:45:49,434 --> 00:45:50,844
there's no time.

347
1402
00:45:57,618 --> 00:46:01,422
Ever since I got to know you, I hoped for

348
1406
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:03,157
only one thing.

349
1410
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:07,463
That you'll become happy

350
1414
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:09,283
and won't cry anymore.

351
1418
00:46:10,564 --> 00:46:12,700
Like the first time we met,

352
1422
00:46:13,776 --> 00:46:15,135
smiling brightly.

353
1426
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:22,542
When tomorrow passes, you might not smile anymore.

354
1430
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:23,844
That scares me.

355
1434
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:28,182
Please don't worry.

356
1438
00:46:31,252 --> 00:46:33,093
I can smile.

357
1442
00:46:33,093 --> 00:46:34,779
I will smile.

358
1446
00:46:38,592 --> 00:46:39,863
Because sunbae

359
1450
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,599
is watching over me.

360
1454
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:56,015
I think I got hit by the wind a lot,

361
1458
00:46:56,015 --> 00:46:58,012
my eyes are salty.

362
1462
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:13,492
I'm okay.

363
1466
00:47:17,664 --> 00:47:20,501
My tears so used to be wiped away by you, Sunbae.

364
1470
00:47:21,502 --> 00:47:24,571
That's why they keep stupidly falling like this.

365
1474
00:48:24,932 --> 00:48:26,099
Whoa, you surprised me!

366
1478
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:27,601
What are you doing?!

367
1482
00:48:27,601 --> 00:48:29,536
Who says I'm doing something?

368
1486
00:48:29,536 --> 00:48:31,671
This girl really..

369
1490
00:48:31,671 --> 00:48:34,074
There's no use glaring at me like that

370
1494
00:48:34,074 --> 00:48:36,117
because starting from tomorrow, you're mine.

371
1498
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:37,544
Yours?! Who's yours?

372
1502
00:48:37,544 --> 00:48:39,513
Stop whining and come downstairs.

373
1506
00:48:39,513 --> 00:48:40,898
The adults are waiting.

374
1510
00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:07,574
Starting tomorrow, we're really going to be one family.

375
1514
00:49:07,574 --> 00:49:08,976
I guess so.

376
1518
00:49:10,477 --> 00:49:12,183
Shin Hwa and JK.

377
1522
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:15,816
And for our children's happiness, let's make a toast.

378
1526
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,652
What are you doing hiding in here?

379
1530
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,089
Noona..

380
1534
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:31,158
When did you come?

381
1538
00:50:31,158 --> 00:50:32,711
There's no need to tell anyone

382
1542
00:50:32,711 --> 00:50:34,896
since I'm not here for your wedding.

383
1546
00:50:36,029 --> 00:50:39,366
I know. 
 Aren't I pathetic?

384
1551
00:50:39,366 --> 00:50:41,034
Goo Joon Pyo.

385
1555
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:44,143
I'm asking how far you're willing to take this?

386
1559
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:46,873
How far does that need to be?

387
1563
00:50:46,873 --> 00:50:48,175
Everything.

388
1567
00:50:49,543 --> 00:50:51,888
Family, Shin Hwa Group.

389
1571
00:50:51,888 --> 00:50:55,716
And even Goo Joon Pyo, your name.

390
1575
00:51:03,155 --> 00:51:05,172
I wasn't able to.

391
1579
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:07,961
When I threw everything away,

392
1583
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:09,263
what would Goo Joon Hee become?

393
1587
00:51:10,931 --> 00:51:14,237
To live my life as a nobody, and only being known as one man's woman.

394
1591
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,069
I didn't have the courage to do that.

395
1595
00:51:17,104 --> 00:51:18,372
Noona..

396
1599
00:51:19,673 --> 00:51:21,208
From that one incident that I was a coward for,

397
1603
00:51:22,726 --> 00:51:24,711
it played its toll on me and made things hard.

398
1607
00:51:27,314 --> 00:51:32,522
I thought I could forget it, 
 but I couldn't.

399
1612
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:36,650
Are you still apologetic to that person?

400
1616
00:51:38,725 --> 00:51:44,698
No. 
 It's not him I feel sorry towards.

401
1621
00:51:45,766 --> 00:51:49,436
It's to whom I thought would always be genuine and justified.

402
1625
00:51:50,137 --> 00:51:52,245
20 year old Goo Joon Hee.

403
1629
00:52:02,981 --> 00:52:06,952
Little brother, no matter what you decide to do,

404
1633
00:52:07,421 --> 00:52:09,056
I'm going to understand.

405
1637
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:12,659
And no matter what you do, or where you do it,

406
1641
00:52:13,427 --> 00:52:15,546
you'll always be the little brother, Goo Joon Pyo,

407
1645
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:18,931
that I love.
 ait'll never change.

408
1650
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:13,898
JiHoo. 
 Just say it.

409
1655
00:53:13,898 --> 00:53:15,689
To me, you're my brother.

410
1659
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:21,766
In the past and even in the future.

411
1663
00:53:25,306 --> 00:53:26,834
But sometimes I think ...

412
1667
00:53:30,036 --> 00:53:32,305
you would probably live well without me.

413
1671
00:53:33,806 --> 00:53:35,675
But what will I do without you?

414
1675
00:53:36,577 --> 00:53:38,744
Could you be...

415
1679
00:53:38,744 --> 00:53:41,694
asking me to help you run away tomorrow.

416
1683
00:53:42,946 --> 00:53:44,781
Are you?

417
1687
00:53:52,422 --> 00:53:54,302
Hit me just once.

418
1691
00:53:54,302 --> 00:53:55,543
What?

419
1695
00:53:55,543 --> 00:53:56,636
This isn't a joke.

420
1699
00:53:58,107 --> 00:53:59,484
I have to take a hit from you.

421
1703
00:53:59,484 --> 00:54:00,685
Joon Pyo...

422
1707
00:54:20,817 --> 00:54:22,285
Jan Di.

423
1711
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,654
I can't let her go.

424
1715
00:54:29,659 --> 00:54:31,431
Which one do you think is better?

425
1719
00:54:31,431 --> 00:54:33,913
This one or 
 this one?

426
1724
00:54:35,537 --> 00:54:37,634
They're all pretty.

427
1728
00:54:37,634 --> 00:54:39,536
You can't say that.

428
1732
00:54:39,536 --> 00:54:43,707
You have to tell the bride 100% coldly and truthfully, as the best friend of the bride.

429
1736
00:54:43,707 --> 00:54:46,347
If you say you like them all, it doesn't help.

430
1740
00:54:48,445 --> 00:54:50,179
Sorry,

431
1744
00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:53,897
but all of them really are pretty.

432
1748
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:08,565
<i>I have something to say.</i>

433
1752
00:56:14,731 --> 00:56:17,184
Ah, ah.

434
1756
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:22,305
Do you, bride, Ha Jae Kyung, take groom, Goo Joon Pyo

435
1760
00:56:23,327 --> 00:56:27,315
as your husband, in times of happiness and sadness

436
1764
00:56:27,315 --> 00:56:30,313
as long as you both shall live?

437
1768
00:56:31,914 --> 00:56:32,682
Yes.

438
1772
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,956
Do you, groom, Goo Joon Pyo, take bride, Ha Jae Kyung as your wife,

439
1776
00:56:39,956 --> 00:56:42,793
in sickness and in health,

440
1780
00:56:42,793 --> 00:56:45,779
and love each other as long as you both shall live?

441
1784
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:51,526
I can't.

442
1788
00:56:55,505 --> 00:56:57,012
I can't do it.

443
1792
00:57:02,779 --> 00:57:03,856
Goo Joon Pyo.

444
1796
00:57:05,181 --> 00:57:07,017
This is just for fun.

445
1800
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:09,452
Why are you so serious?

446
1804
00:57:09,452 --> 00:57:11,275
I'm not joking, Monkey.

447
1808
00:57:11,955 --> 00:57:15,324
No . . .

448
1812
00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:19,503
Ha Jae Kyung.

449
1816
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:22,932
We can't get married.

450
1820
00:57:24,267 --> 00:57:25,459
Joon.

451
1824
00:57:26,302 --> 00:57:27,437
I'm sorry.

452
1828
00:57:29,673 --> 00:57:31,707
If sorry was enough . . .

453
1832
00:57:31,707 --> 00:57:35,745
then why are there laws and why are there police?

454
1836
00:57:40,383 --> 00:57:41,951
There's a girl I love.

455
1840
00:57:43,786 --> 00:57:45,255
The first since I was born.

456
1844
00:57:46,456 --> 00:57:47,657
And until the day I die,

457
1848
00:57:48,858 --> 00:57:50,960
she's the only one.

458
1852
00:57:53,972 --> 00:57:56,132
Do you still want to marry me?

459
1856
00:57:58,419 --> 00:57:59,086
Yes.

460
1860
00:57:59,335 --> 00:58:00,170
Are you out of your mind?

461
1864
00:58:02,672 --> 00:58:06,443
I know. That girl is Geum Jan Di.

462
1868
00:58:07,977 --> 00:58:09,245
But . . .

463
1872
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:15,285
I want you and I want to continue.

464
1876
00:58:17,587 --> 00:58:23,159
It might be funny, but I like you because you're single-minded.

465
1880
00:58:25,363 --> 00:58:28,101
Because you're a man who knows how to love properly,

466
1884
00:58:28,101 --> 00:58:29,265
I like you more.

467
1888
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:32,803
The fact that it's Geum Jan Di,

468
1892
00:58:34,137 --> 00:58:35,773
I can endure it.

469
1896
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:39,447
I know you won't forget her easily.

470
1900
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:42,011
But,

471
1904
00:58:42,011 --> 00:58:43,179
I will wait.

472
1908
00:58:44,681 --> 00:58:46,378
If I wait and see . . .

473
1912
00:58:48,385 --> 00:58:49,486
next time,

474
1916
00:58:49,486 --> 00:58:51,267
there might be a chance for me.

475
1920
00:58:51,267 --> 00:58:53,292
That you will love me like you love her.

476
1924
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:54,591
Ha Jae Kyung

477
1928
00:58:57,611 --> 00:58:58,908
That's all I need.

478
1932
00:58:58,908 --> 00:59:01,131
It's worth the investment for me.

479
1936
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:21,217
Goo Joon Pyo.

480
1940
00:59:23,307 --> 00:59:24,054
Forgive me.

481
1944
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,823
I don't want to.

482
1948
00:59:29,493 --> 00:59:31,194
Listen well.

483
1952
00:59:32,262 --> 00:59:34,531
We are going to be husband and wife in this place tomorrow.

484
1956
00:59:35,999 --> 00:59:37,233
No matter what,

485
1960
00:59:38,401 --> 00:59:41,004
until the day we die

486
1964
00:59:41,004 --> 00:59:43,186
we're going to promise to love each other.

487
1968
00:59:44,874 --> 00:59:47,853
Even though you are pleading with me to forgive you,

488
1972
00:59:50,614 --> 00:59:53,216
there's nothing for me to forgive.

489
1976
01:00:00,918 --> 01:00:02,507
It's late already.

490
1980
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:07,097
They begged me to go to bed early tonight so my make-up will take tomorrow.

491
1984
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,013
I'll be going first.

492
1988
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,472
Joon Pyo, it's almost time.

493
1992
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,501
You'd better come out.

494
1996
01:01:34,615 --> 01:01:35,885
Woo Bin.

495
2000
01:01:37,053 --> 01:01:38,233
I have a favor to ask

496
2004
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:39,155
What's it?

497
2008
01:01:40,156 --> 01:01:41,847
Please break my arm!

498
2012
01:01:41,847 --> 01:01:42,992
What?!

499
2016
01:01:43,226 --> 01:01:44,695
Joon Pyo.

500
2020
01:01:45,095 --> 01:01:46,462
There's no time

501
2024
01:01:48,731 --> 01:01:50,667
With your skill, you can do it in one blow.

502
2028
01:01:50,667 --> 01:01:52,504
Are you serious?

503
2032
01:02:09,098 --> 01:02:11,250
What are you doing right now ?

504
2036
01:02:18,327 --> 01:02:20,229
Don't worry about it. Go outside.

505
2040
01:02:20,229 --> 01:02:23,665
Is that all you could come up with?

506
2044
01:02:25,068 --> 01:02:27,139
If that is the only way to stop the wedding,

507
2048
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:28,605
then it's better if you just go ahead with it.

508
2052
01:02:28,605 --> 01:02:29,806
Geum Jan Di...

509
2056
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:31,507
You're a coward!

510
2060
01:02:31,507 --> 01:02:34,143
You're not being dignified in front of anyone.

511
2064
01:02:34,143 --> 01:02:36,853
You're not facing it, you're just running away!

512
2068
01:02:38,353 --> 01:02:41,049
If you run away like this..

513
2072
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,586
someday, it might happen again.

514
2076
01:02:46,656 --> 01:02:48,391
Then tell me not to do it!

515
2080
01:02:49,426 --> 01:02:51,227
Tell me not to go!

516
2084
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,744
Say something!

517
2088
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:51,020
- We have to shoot it again.
- Do I have to go up there?

518
2093
01:03:59,238 --> 01:04:00,230
Wait a minute!

519
2097
01:04:19,082 --> 01:04:19,849
Did I fall asleep? Did you shoot that?
