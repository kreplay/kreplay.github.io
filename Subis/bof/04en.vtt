1
3
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:05,418
Who do you think you are? 
Who are you to say those things?

2
8
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:08,754
Who asked you to make such a request?

3
12
00:01:08,754 --> 00:01:12,091
No, not a request,
 to beg?

4
17
00:01:13,193 --> 00:01:16,028
Don't you have any pride?

5
21
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:19,365
It's not because I don't have any pride.

6
25
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:24,770
It's because you were in such agony.

7
29
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,673
Because you looked like you would die from sadness.

8
33
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:28,570
What is it to you?

9
37
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,046
It has nothing to do with you.

10
41
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:37,483
Get lost

11
45
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:41,280
There's a dark cloud surrounding you.  
What's the use of the self-luminosity of the F4??

12
50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,649
She's such a black hole. . .

13
54
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:47,319
Goo JoonPyo

14
58
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,389
Can I ask you something?

15
62
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:53,591
If I said no 
would you keep it to yourself?

16
67
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,929
Just act like you usually do.
This doesn't suit you.

17
72
00:02:58,063 --> 00:03:08,808
When you like someone is it better to hold back your own feelings....

18
76
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:10,410
...and consider that person's feelings first?

19
80
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,311
What's better about that?!

20
84
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:13,847
Huh?

21
88
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:19,685
What's with that? 
That's the same thing as ignoring them.

22
93
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:25,590
If the world were to fall to pieces tomorrow, then you'd probably die of regret.

23
97
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,893
Goo JoonPyo

24
101
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:27,794
What?

25
105
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:33,933
You might not be completely stupid.

26
109
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:40,907
You're just figuring that out now? It's better to regret after you act, instead of regretting after having done nothing. That's my philosophy.

27
113
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:45,478
It looks like JiHoo isn't going to show up after all.

28
117
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,759
Everyone be well. Stay out of trouble.

29
121
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:07,700
Have a good trip. I'll come to visit.

30
125
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,069
Not just to visit but to hold an exhibition.

31
129
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:17,243
Take care of your health.

32
133
00:04:19,145 --> 00:04:24,984
Oh, the kindness disease. 
If you're too kind, the hurt lasts just as long, Mr. Casanova.

33
138
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:34,827
Must you do that lawyer or NGO crap, Noona?

34
142
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:38,097
I just don't understand you women.

35
146
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:42,001
Do you know it's been 10 years since
you've sincerely called me Noona?

36
151
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:45,738
It seems you've become cool, so I decided to acknowledge you as my noona.

37
155
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:47,173
Are you complaining?

38
159
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:52,478
JanDi,

39
163
00:04:58,017 --> 00:05:01,753
Please remember my request.

40
167
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:04,290
Please take care of yourself.

41
171
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:11,530
Take care everyone. 
I'm leaving.

42
176
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,699
Go. Take care of yourself.

43
180
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:36,856
Stubborn bastard. 
How could he not come to see her off?

44
185
00:05:36,856 --> 00:05:43,796
What did I tell you? Say what you want about me, but  Ji Hoo is the real cruel one among us.

45
189
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:47,800
He looks so serene, but once he turns his back, he's the scariest.

46
193
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,136
Isn't talking behind my back a little too harsh?

47
197
00:05:58,745 --> 00:05:59,579
You

48
201
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:00,713
What is this?

49
205
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:01,814
When did you get here?

50
209
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:02,882
Three hours ago.

51
213
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,283
What?

52
217
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:08,554
So you were here the whole time... and you didn't even come out for a peek?

53
221
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,760
What are you gonna do now?

54
225
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,197
Are you just going to stand around here?

55
229
00:06:18,197 --> 00:06:20,432
Go after her!

56
233
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:24,670
If she can't stay here, you should go to her.

57
237
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,606
Didn't you say you loved her?

58
241
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,944
Hiding behind posts, is that how you show your love?

59
245
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:34,714
How can you say you love her behaving like that?

60
249
00:06:43,957 --> 00:06:47,727
I'm on the next flight. 
 All my luggage is already checked in.

61
254
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:50,963
Yoon JiHoo.

62
258
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:54,100
Rascal
 he has a knack for surprising people.

63
263
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,335
When did you get the guts to do something like this?

64
267
00:06:56,335 --> 00:07:01,040
Thanks to this little lady.

65
271
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,674
What?

66
275
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:02,541
What?

67
279
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:05,077
Rascal.

68
283
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:09,214
Get over here! 
Cute rascal!

69
288
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:12,118
aranyos

70
292
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:19,091
I'm proud of you.

71
296
00:07:23,996 --> 00:07:26,198
Thank you.

72
300
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:30,536
You were the one who made me realize that I have to face reality and be honest with myself..

73
304
00:07:32,438 --> 00:07:37,209
You taught me to have the courage to beg when necessary.

74
308
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:43,849
I'm glad to have met a girl like you.

75
312
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm leaving now.

76
316
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:48,747
Geum JanDi,

77
320
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:52,285
What? 
What do you want?

78
325
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:55,253
Listen to what I have to say.

79
329
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:59,291
I'm only going to say this once
so listen very carefully.

80
334
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:06,832
Geum JanDi... You and I...
 (voice drowned out by the plane taking off) Should date

81
339
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:29,121
What did he say?

82
343
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:31,156
You're not getting in?

83
347
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:52,812
Saturday at 4 o'clock. 
In front of Nam San Tower.

84
352
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:04,089
If you're late by even one minute, you're dead.

85
356
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,104
We must get it at all costs.

86
360
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:27,179
Come quickly!

87
364
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:33,052
As soon as it opens at
4 o'clock, run for this.

88
369
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:36,756
And if you find something that you
think it'll fit, just stuff it in the cart.

89
374
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:38,057
Wouldn't it be better
if we just go together?

90
379
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:41,260
Mom needs to go to the cabbage blowout sale.

91
383
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,663
If the clothes shop were the civil war,
this cabbage shop is

92
388
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:45,965
World War II.

93
392
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:47,232
Right.

94
396
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:50,770
You know, last time the lady standing next
to me got her teeth knocked out.

95
401
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,304
Really?

96
405
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:58,077
Three months worth of our shop
profits are in our hands. 
Got it? Aja!!

97
411
00:10:58,077 --> 00:10:59,178
Fight!

98
415
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,216
Oh, it's snowing.

99
419
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:01,253
We should get going
Dad must be waiting.

100
424
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,830
Saturday. 4 o'clock. 
In front of Namsan Tower.

101
429
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,436
It can't be!  No, no,  no way!

102
433
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,873
Why are you mumbling like a crazy girl?

103
437
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,474
Mom

104
441
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,508
Yes?

105
445
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:28,213
One wouldn't wait outside for four hours in this snow on a promise that wasn't really made, would he?

106
449
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:32,083
No way, unless that person is crazy. 
 Let's go.

107
454
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,352
Let's go!

108
458
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,086
Hang on.

109
462
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:36,687
That crazy jerk.

110
466
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:38,090
Mom, hold this.

111
470
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,592
What?

112
474
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,961
Mom, go home first!

113
478
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,897
Yah, JanDi!  Where are you going?

114
482
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,665
I need to go somewhere!

115
486
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,267
Ahh, that girl!！

116
490
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,388
What time is it?

117
494
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,289
Shouldn't I be the one asking that?

118
498
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:47,993
Don't you know what time it is right now?

119
502
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,296
Didn't I tell you that you'd be dead if you're late?

120
506
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,398
Did I ever promise that I'd come?

121
510
00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:54,500
You came.

122
514
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,069
Well, that is . . . .

123
518
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:02,341
I came to check if you were here.

124
522
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,610
What would've happened if i didn't come?!

125
526
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,078
You showed up anyway, didn't you?

126
530
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:12,751
Also, whose fault is it that I'm in this state!  
So stop getting angry like you have any reason to be.

127
535
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,090
Ah, it's cold.

128
539
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,462
Get up.

129
543
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,767
I'll buy you a nice hot drink.

130
547
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,103
Or youll get sick

131
551
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,450
Get up. 
Hurry!

132
556
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,933
Do you want to drink tea or just go?

133
560
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,385
Here.

134
564
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,725
This is 30,000 won coffee [about $30].

135
568
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:31,029
What a thug. Are your trying to scam me?

136
572
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,298
I don't drink this kind of stuff anyway.

137
576
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:39,872
Just give it a try first.  
This coffee is the best.

138
581
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,745
Should I tell you why it cost $30?

139
585
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,247
Follow me.

140
589
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,671
How is it?
 I was right, wasnt I?

141
594
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,842
It's the same as drinking coffee in the sky-lounge.

142
598
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:23,682
Tsk tsk. You'd never be able to run a business, 
 not even a mom and pop store.

143
603
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,783
What?!

144
607
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,885
36,300 won ($36.3)

145
611
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:27,853
Huh?

146
615
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:32,290
You need to include tax and service tips.

147
619
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,260
Wow, so even the rich know how to caluclate those kinds of things!

148
623
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,398
I just pretend not to know. 
There's no way you could be come rich without knowing those things, could you?

149
628
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,386
Are you joking?  They're satellites.

150
632
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:04,323
I don't want to hear that from you!

151
636
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,224
What, 'stupid girl'?

152
640
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,491
What, you stupid boy!

153
644
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:07,559
You're dumb!

154
648
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,528
You're dumber!

155
652
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:27,779
Hello?  You're at the restaurant?  Oh, okay.  Stay right there.  I'll be right over.

156
656
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:47,699
What happened?

157
660
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:48,633
What's that?

158
664
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,503
Why so dark?

159
668
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:06,885
Woah. Woah! Mister! 
There are people still in here!! woah woah.

160
673
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,226
Is it really locked?

161
677
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,428
Mister!!

162
681
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:24,169
Why are you shaking like a weirdo? 
Just hold on, I'll just call someone.

163
686
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,406
I have to get going! 
My mom is going to kill me!

164
691
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,810
Where's my cellphone?

165
695
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,245
You don't have your phone?

166
699
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,146
How about you?

167
703
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,519
It's your fault we're trapped in like this!

168
707
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,954
How is it my fault?!

169
711
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:46,358
Who was the one that waited like an idiot for hours outside?

170
715
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,660
I got excited, that's why.

171
719
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,729
I've never gotten to wait for someone like that.

172
723
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,431
What?!

173
727
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,774
What are we going to do?

174
731
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,316
Mister!

175
735
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,751
What are you doing?

176
739
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,954
Shall we wait in there?

177
743
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,439
Hey.. 
Move over.

178
748
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,974
No.

179
752
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,189
Sorry.

180
756
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,491
What?

181
760
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:31,296
I'm sorry. 
This is all my fault.

182
765
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,865
You've finally realized it.

183
769
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,569
But why did a rich boy like you do something like this?

184
773
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:43,909
Waiting in the snow for 4 hours... isn't your family worried?

185
777
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,046
Butler, bodyguard, drivers, ... what are they doing right now?

186
781
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,014
I sent them home.

187
785
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,015
Why?

188
789
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,717
I wanted to try to do things the way someone like you, a commoner, would.

189
793
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,321
How hard that must be for you!

190
797
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,289
Hey JanDi baht (lawn).

191
801
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,590
What?!

192
805
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,529
Can I tell you the truth?

193
809
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,732
Truthfully.. 
what?

194
814
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,904
What is it?

195
818
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,341
Hey. 
You can say it from right there.

196
823
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,910
I uh... now...

197
827
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,277
Eh?

198
831
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:27,986
You bastard! 
You pervert!

199
836
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,171
Do you really want to do this in this kind of situation?

200
840
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,602
Shoot, stay away from me!

201
844
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:54,655
one
 two

202
849
00:21:54,655 --> 00:22:05,900
2 1/2
2 
3!

203
855
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,106
Three!

204
859
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:07,363
It's cold. 
 Cold?

205
864
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,825
What are you doing?

206
868
00:23:36,825 --> 00:23:42,196
If you wrap your head with a shawl.. 
then you'll get warmer.

207
873
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:25,900
Get in 
I'll take you home.

208
878
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:38,210
No thanks.  Anyway. I have to think about what I have to say to my mom.  I'll just walk and take the bus.

209
882
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,183
I could help you out, help you think of an excuse?

210
886
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,769
Ah, ah,ah!  
AI YAH!

211
891
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:27,763
I'm sorry mom and dad.  I'll never do this again.  I have sinned greatly!

212
895
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:31,832
One, Two, Three!

213
899
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:35,737
Who sinned greatly? It seems you saved a pretty important person last night, huh?

214
903
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:37,940
The successor to the Shinhwa Group!


215
908
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,542
Then Shinhwa group is what kind of group?

216
912
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:43,118
The number one group in Korea, of course!

217
916
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:49,451
Then having saved the successor of Shinhwa group is as good as saving the Korean economy.

218
920
00:26:49,451 --> 00:26:53,422
How would it be a sin? 
 It's not even enough for you to get a decoration!

219
925
00:26:53,422 --> 00:26:56,325
That's why these came instead of decorations!

220
929
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:01,296
It looks good, huh?

221
933
00:27:01,296 --> 00:27:05,134
Where did all this come from? 
'And how did you know that?

222
938
00:27:05,134 --> 00:27:11,773
How could we not know!  Young master . . . wait . . . young master, young master.. what was the young master's name?

223
942
00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:14,243
Joon Pyo! Goo JoonPyo!

224
946
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:15,644
Goo JoonPyo.

225
950
00:27:15,644 --> 00:27:17,379
I know, I know.

226
954
00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:20,582
Young master, JoonPyo, sent all this.

227
958
00:27:20,582 --> 00:27:27,389
He told us that you were with him and told us not to scold you, and all this is to repay your kindness.

228
962
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:34,062
Maybe because he is a young master of the supreme Chaebol (Korean conglomerate) group, how polite he was!

229
966
00:27:34,062 --> 00:27:38,567
He said next time he will visit us in person to see how we're doing.

230
970
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:42,337
It's so touching. 
My tears keep welling up.

231
975
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:44,039
Mom, don't cry.

232
979
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:53,748
Honey 
how could you cry on such a good day?

233
984
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:14,002
Tell them that since you spent the night with me
 I'll take the responsibility for you.

234
989
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:26,248
Hey! JoonPyo sunbae's going out with Geum JanDi !!!

235
993
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:29,084
Geum JanDi's boyfriend is JoonPyo sunbae !!!!

236
997
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,057
Geum JanDi ascends to JoonPyo's girlfriend.

237
1001
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:32,454
Commoner, Geum JanDi's upward social mobility! Ascent to Goo JoonPyo's girlfriend.

238
1005
00:28:32,454 --> 00:28:34,856
Geum JanDi becomes Goo JoonPyo's girlfriend.

239
1009
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:36,658
I'm so jealous!

240
1013
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,595
Oh, isn't she JanDi?

241
1017
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:40,562
JanDi's coming.

242
1021
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:44,866
JanDi! Hi! 
You're so pretty today!

243
1026
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:51,171
Geum Jan Di, hi!

244
1030
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:55,143
JanDi, hi!  Nice to meet you!

245
1034
00:28:55,143 --> 00:28:57,747
JanDi! JanDi! 
Good morning!

246
1039
00:28:57,747 --> 00:29:00,483
Oh! oh! good morning!

247
1043
00:29:02,351 --> 00:29:09,224
JanDi!  JanDi!  
Don't you want to go shopping together?

248
1048
00:29:09,224 --> 00:29:13,428
Geum JanDi. Come to my birthday party next week. 
 Here, have this.

249
1053
00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:15,564
Thank you. Thank you.

250
1057
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:20,502
Bye!

251
1061
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:33,681
Geum Jan Di.

252
1065
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:34,883
Evil.

253
1069
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:37,152
This must be some kind of plot.

254
1073
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,820
JoonPyo, is this really true?

255
1077
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,992
It's not!  It's not!  It's not what you guys think!

256
1081
00:30:16,992 --> 00:30:17,592
This is...

257
1085
00:30:17,592 --> 00:30:19,294
Yeah.

258
1089
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:25,934
It's true.         
  No! No!

259
1094
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:15,050
A long time ago, in a golden lawn (Geum JanDi) hill where Magi--

260
1098
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,586
(Singing)

261
1102
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:19,755
Are you ok?

262
1106
00:31:22,157 --> 00:31:23,891
Yeah.

263
1110
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:27,129
Just a little lightheaded.

264
1114
00:31:30,832 --> 00:31:38,172
That's a relief.  Nobody knows that I came here, so it's okay.

265
1118
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,109
JanDi . . .

266
1122
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:40,909
Eh?

267
1126
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:47,649
F4 Goo Joon Pyo, is it true?

268
1130
00:31:50,552 --> 00:31:56,123
It can't... No way. It's just a rumor.

269
1134
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,763
But it seems, he really likes you.

270
1138
00:32:01,763 --> 00:32:10,171
No, no way. He's just joking around and making fun of me. 
 How could Goo JoonPyo...!

271
1143
00:32:10,171 --> 00:32:13,310
Don't you know how he is ? Especially with the incident last time...

272
1147
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,610
How could the so called "Great Goo JoonPyo" like me?

273
1151
00:32:24,952 --> 00:32:29,490
That does seem impossible, 
 right?

274
1156
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,828
R....right.

275
1160
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:51,845
JanDi, wanna go somewhere and have some fun?

276
1164
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,115
Wait one sec..

277
1168
00:33:20,405 --> 00:33:21,810
Shin Hwa Kindergarden ?

278
1172
00:33:27,115 --> 00:33:30,685
NO!

279
1176
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:32,222
Why are you touching other people's things?!

280
1180
00:33:32,222 --> 00:33:34,755
What is it that you are so curious about?!

281
1184
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:38,460
Sorry

282
1188
00:33:40,862 --> 00:33:45,567
It's because I wrote some weird things in it. . .

283
1192
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:50,572
It's a bit embarrassing...

284
1196
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:09,255
No, I'm sorry for touching it without your permission.

285
1200
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:13,662
Come with me to change.

286
1204
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,302
JoonPyo, are you serious?


287
1209
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:21,469
About what? 


288
1214
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:23,104
I'm talking about Geum JanDi.


289
1219
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,806
If it's not for real, what else would it be?

290
1223
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:28,877
For us, it isn't easy to call many things "real."

291
1227
00:34:28,877 --> 00:34:31,413
Our freedom only extends as far as dating.

292
1231
00:34:31,413 --> 00:34:36,384
You haven't forgotten that it's your parents who make the final decision, right?

293
1235
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:39,888
Was it just  talk when you guys said you were men?

294
1239
00:34:39,888 --> 00:34:44,426
What is this?  You mean to say, it was all just a show?

295
1243
00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:46,895
What is your meaning of a real man then?

296
1247
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:49,864
A man who is responsible from the beginning to the end.

297
1251
00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:51,232
Till the end?

298
1255
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:54,836
That's right!  
Till the end.

299
1260
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,280
Don't you want to dance?

300
1264
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,281
Eh?

301
1268
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:15,982
Don't you want to dance?

302
1272
00:36:15,982 --> 00:36:20,688
This is my first time at a place like this
 I'm just going to watch.

303
1277
00:36:20,688 --> 00:36:23,658
Ok. 
Then wait here for a minute.

304
1282
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:10,972
Ah!!

305
1286
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:11,806
I'm very sorry.

306
1290
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:28,690
With a figure like that there's no way you'd fit into a place like this.

307
1294
00:37:31,226 --> 00:37:35,163
Try not to make an ass of yourself!

308
1298
00:37:35,864 --> 00:37:38,299
Gaeul, you're not going anywhere right?

309
1302
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,877
Quick, go and make porridge or something!

310
1306
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:54,916
Welco . . . .

311
1310
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,993
It's her day off.

312
1314
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:08,128
And you...JanDi's friend?

313
1318
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,064
Since when?

314
1322
00:38:10,064 --> 00:38:11,900
Since kindergarten.

315
1326
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,501
Then you're her best friend?

316
1330
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,469
Yeah.

317
1334
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:15,671
Lets go!

318
1338
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:18,840
Eh?  
To where?

319
1343
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,342
Oh!  Oh!

320
1347
00:38:27,716 --> 00:38:30,752
See! 
I was right.

321
1352
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,734
What kind of advice?

322
1356
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:50,504
Things like "Don't even look at a tree that you can't climb"?

323
1360
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:55,042
Or "You are a toy to pass the time of Young Masters of the Chaebol (Korean conglomerate). 
So when you are thrown away, just accept it."

324
1365
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:57,879
Hey, calm down.

325
1369
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:10,825
You may think that every girl would fall for your sweet talk with that cute face of yours,

326
1373
00:39:10,825 --> 00:39:12,660
but I'm not like that.

327
1377
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,263
I'm going to pretend that I didn't hear you.

328
1381
00:39:26,474 --> 00:39:28,676
The more I think about it, it's infuriating!

329
1385
00:39:28,676 --> 00:39:32,113
The one who started this was not JanDi, but him.

330
1389
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:36,284
Our JanDi never even dreamed of climbing up that kind of tree. 
Got that??

331
1394
00:39:54,301 --> 00:39:56,937
Nothing at all.

332
1398
00:39:56,937 --> 00:40:01,643
When a girl dashes out of here in anger, there could be only one reason.

333
1402
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:06,281
Whatever.  
She's not my type. I don't care for that genre.

334
1407
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:07,816
What genre is that?

335
1411
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:12,520
The kind that whether it be a comedy or romance, always ends up as a tear-jerking soap opera.

336
1415
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,024
I really don't like tacky things like that.

337
1419
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,810
You didn't have to go after that so desperately.

338
1423
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:55,630
It's not really that big a deal.

339
1427
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:03,039
It's suffocating in here, isn't it?

340
1431
00:43:30,095 --> 00:43:32,464
Ah, I'm thirsty.

341
1435
00:44:02,727 --> 00:44:11,236
(Thanks for last night.)

342
1439
00:44:23,548 --> 00:44:28,720
No.. 
No! This can't be!!!

343
1444
00:45:05,924 --> 00:45:11,496
That whole Red card thing, bullying others is what I hate the most of all.

344
1448
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,401
Lets go!!


345
1453
00:46:06,418 --> 00:46:09,888
Why? 
When did you get so cheeky?

346
1458
00:46:09,888 --> 00:46:14,025
My goodness... how rude of you.

347
1462
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:16,828
This is why they say poor people are the scariest..

348
1466
00:46:16,828 --> 00:46:21,499
I knew that you were pretending to be innocent. 
But you've gone too far.

349
1471
00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:25,737
Ya! I don't understand a thing you're saying!

350
1475
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:27,238
There's no reason for you to be treating me like this.

351
1479
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:28,006
Really, no reason?

352
1483
00:46:28,006 --> 00:46:29,474
Let go! 
Are you going to let go?

353
1488
00:46:29,474 --> 00:46:35,146
Let's teach her a lesson! 
What? Why? Let go!

354
1493
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,383
Hurry!

355
1497
00:46:39,383 --> 00:46:42,454
Let go of me!

356
1501
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,825
No reason for this?

357
1505
00:46:46,825 --> 00:46:50,194
Cheating on JoonPyo sunbae, is the same as cheating on all of us.

358
1509
00:46:50,194 --> 00:46:54,132
Insulting F4, is the same as insulting all of us!

359
1513
00:46:54,132 --> 00:47:02,040
A dirty rag like you..
 Did you really think we'd let you 
disgrace Shin-hwa High like this?

360
1519
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,276
You bitch...

361
1523
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,138
Ah...

362
1527
00:47:33,138 --> 00:47:34,205
What are you  doing?

363
1531
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:48,953
JoonPyo sunbae, don't be fooled by her!  Once you see this, you'll come to your senses!

364
1535
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:58,596
No, Goo JoonPyo. This isn't the truth! They're wrong.

365
1539
00:48:25,256 --> 00:48:30,628
I don't know. 
 I think someone tricked me.

366
1544
00:48:30,628 --> 00:48:32,197
So this is who you are?

367
1548
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:36,334
Is this the type of woman you are?

368
1552
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:42,974
You were fooled were you?
 Are you really the type of woman 
who can be tricked so easily?

369
1558
00:48:47,245 --> 00:48:52,517
Goo JoonPyo, it doesn't matter whether you believe me or not.

370
1562
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:58,523
I don't know why I'm defending myself over something so ridiculous.

371
1566
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:23,915
The woman in the picture . . . Is it not you, Geum Jan Di?

372
1570
00:49:41,366 --> 00:49:45,670
Fine. 
You'll be glad to know that I don't.

373
1575
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:50,809
Geum JanDi, from now on, I want nothing to do with you.

374
1579
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:03,588
Hey, you rag!

375
1583
00:50:03,588 --> 00:50:06,624
Transfer!

376
1587
00:50:06,624 --> 00:50:14,098
Take off your uniform!  Take it off, hurry!

377
1591
00:50:58,476 --> 00:51:02,046
I haven't seen him act like this since Joon Hee noona got married.

378
1595
00:51:03,047 --> 00:51:04,414
Quick, let's go.

379
1599
00:51:49,427 --> 00:51:53,031
I went to ask, but they said they don't know him

380
1603
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:57,234
When you first woke up in the morning, was there anything that stuck out in the bedroom?

381
1607
00:51:57,234 --> 00:52:00,171
Like a business card or personal belongings.

382
1611
00:52:02,507 --> 00:52:07,178
Ah! There was a memo written on the mirror.

383
1615
00:52:07,178 --> 00:52:12,183
It said, "Thank you for last night."  in red lipstick.

384
1619
00:52:12,183 --> 00:52:15,953
Wait, Lipstick?

385
1623
00:52:15,953 --> 00:52:17,555
Yeah.

386
1627
00:52:17,555 --> 00:52:19,457
Was it yours?

387
1631
00:52:19,457 --> 00:52:20,358
No

388
1635
00:52:20,358 --> 00:52:23,061
Then it must belong to that guy!

389
1639
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:30,168
Tsssk.

390
1643
00:52:30,168 --> 00:52:33,538
Wait a minute!
Could it be?

391
1648
00:52:33,538 --> 00:52:37,609
Look, these photos don't look like selca. 
(selca: short for 'self camera pictures')

392
1653
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:42,312
There must've been another person in the room, because someone else took the photos.

393
1657
00:52:42,312 --> 00:52:44,616
The owner of the lipstick?

394
1661
00:52:50,822 --> 00:52:52,023
What are you doing?

395
1665
00:52:52,023 --> 00:52:53,014
It looked like there was some dust there.

396
1669
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:56,313
But it won't rub off.

397
1673
00:53:02,953 --> 00:53:04,054
Look at that!

398
1677
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:08,058
Let's go.

399
1681
00:53:11,695 --> 00:53:12,930
Uhhh . . . sure.

400
1685
00:53:16,433 --> 00:53:21,338
With looks like that...
 they're definitely from Andromeda.

401
1690
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,448
I don't recognize it.

402
1694
00:53:44,495 --> 00:53:45,896
It's a bit complicated.

403
1698
00:53:45,896 --> 00:53:48,966
Complicated? I hear he's the head honcho here.

404
1702
00:53:50,601 --> 00:53:54,938
I guess, if we take away the head honcho that would be a big blow to you.

405
1706
00:53:54,938 --> 00:53:56,907
Thank you for understanding.

406
1710
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:01,779
But..

407
1714
00:54:01,779 --> 00:54:08,352
If you don't hand over that guy, we might have to close down this place. 
How about that?

408
1719
00:54:08,352 --> 00:54:09,253
What?

409
1723
00:54:09,253 --> 00:54:10,487
WIthin a month?

410
1727
00:54:18,462 --> 00:54:21,098
We'll be able to start as soon as tomorrow

411
1731
00:54:21,098 --> 00:54:23,867
Shall I practice? I need a bit of a warm up.

412
1735
00:55:23,427 --> 00:55:24,695
What was that name?

413
1739
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:22,519
So then..

414
1743
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:25,556
f(x) is equal to or greater than 0

415
1747
00:56:51,015 --> 00:56:55,118
Everyone is invited to the Tomato party for the commoner Geum JanDi

416
1751
00:57:15,873 --> 00:57:18,875
Goodbye.

417
1755
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:23,280
Going first?

418
1759
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:28,552
JanDi, JanDi

419
1763
00:57:30,354 --> 00:57:34,825
I have something important to take care of, 
so I'm going to go first, okay?

420
1768
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:58,181
Oh nothing. 
Later

421
1773
00:58:18,835 --> 00:58:19,770
(one, two, three)

422
1777
01:00:28,831 --> 01:00:30,600
There's no need to be in such pain.

423
1781
01:00:34,738 --> 01:00:38,408
Why are you acting like this
 over a lowly commoner like her?

424
1786
01:00:40,677 --> 01:00:42,879
It doesn't make sense.

425
1790
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:08,305
If you're her friend, why would you say those things?

426
1794
01:01:14,945 --> 01:01:17,848
Because she stole you from me.

427
1798
01:01:28,124 --> 01:01:31,460
Don't go, please.

428
1802
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:34,096
Take your hands off me.

429
1806
01:01:37,066 --> 01:01:41,872
Why Geum JanDi and not me?!


430
1811
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:47,944
What do you see in her? 


431
1816
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:20,844
I don't know.  
I think someone's trying to set me up.

432
1821
01:02:52,075 --> 01:02:56,680
Attack!!
