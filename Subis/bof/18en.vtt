1
3
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,120
What?

2
7
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,960
Let go.

3
11
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,720
I don't want to.

4
15
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:33,640
I'm not going to let you go.

5
19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,960
Hey, monkey.

6
23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,120
Okay.  If you call me "monkey" I want to be a monkey for you.

7
27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,880
Even if that's the only way. I've come to the point where I really want to cling to your shoulders.

8
31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,560
The man that is right for you,

9
35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,480
is out there somewhere.

10
39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,840
Because  you...

11
43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,847
aren't so bad.

12
47
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:10,080
I don't want some other guy.

13
51
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,760
If he's not Goo Joon Pyo, then he won't do.

14
55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,560
I'm sorry.

15
59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,040
Is there someone you like?

16
63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,560
Yeah.

17
67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,720
Aren't you going to ask who it is?

18
71
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,280
I don't want to hear.

19
75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,680
I can't hear a word. I don't want to hear one word. Ahhhhhhh!

20
79
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,080
I don't want to hear anything!

21
83
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,320
Did you just see a ghost or something?

22
87
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,460
No.

23
91
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,080
I didn't see anything.

24
95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,120
I really didn't see anything!

25
99
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,520
Let's go.

26
103
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,720
Where?

27
107
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,480
If I leave you alone,

28
111
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
you might jump in the water again.

29
115
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,940
I feel like a fool.  What is wrong with me?

30
119
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
You're not a fool.

31
123
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,240
So,

32
127
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,120
don't scold yourself so much.

33
131
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,980
Why Macau of all places?

34
135
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,940
I'm trying to find someone.

35
139
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,920
Ah, your boyfriend?

36
143
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,480
Uh, well, yeah.

37
147
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,640
<i>I'm leaving first. <b> -Goo Joon Pyo</b></i>

38
151
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,360
Song Woo Bin!

39
155
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,420
You'd better hurry up and get down from there.

40
159
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,340
Hey, So Yi Jung.

41
163
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,280
Why are you still my friend?

42
167
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,420
What?

43
171
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,640
Give me a straight answer.

44
175
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,384
Aren't you embarrassed to be friends with the son of a mafia boss like me?

45
179
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:02,300
Stop talking nonsense. Hurry up and get down from there!

46
183
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:09,840
I'm embarrassed myself, so I can only imagine what it must be like for you guys.

47
187
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,240
It's only because of you guys that I get by.

48
191
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,320
Those from "decent" homes don't even consider me human.

49
195
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,500
Even I know that.

50
199
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,739
Song Woo Bin, why are you...

51
203
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,720
But, I...

52
207
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,380
I'm only embarrassed in front of you guys.

53
211
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,280
My boss...the path I've got to take...

54
215
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,300
I don't care what others say or think, but to you guys...in front of you guys...

55
219
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:45,480
I'm embarrassed sometimes.

56
223
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:52,460
That annoys me and I feel like I'm going to die.

57
227
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,120
Do you know? 
 Do you guys even know?!

58
232
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,077
You jerk!

59
236
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,420
To you,

60
240
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,660
to you, that's all we're worth?

61
244
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,900
Do you think we are any better than you?!

62
248
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,780
If you act like this, what about me? What about us?

63
252
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,000
If, once in a while you're embarrassed, can't you let it out in front of your friends?

64
256
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,940
Huh?

65
260
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:26,031
So then, does that really make us friends? Brothers?! F4?!  Tell me, you bastard!

66
264
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,966
<i>So Yi Jung</i>

67
268
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,407
OMG! F4!

68
272
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,160
Hey, what do you think you're doing, you bastard?!

69
276
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,020
Get lost!

70
280
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,600
Yi Jung!!

71
284
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,500
Why'd you drink so much?

72
288
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,627
Ahh!

73
292
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,500
Yi Jung, are you okay?

74
296
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,540
Young Master, should we take care of this?

75
300
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,300
You guys stay out of it.

76
304
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,340
I'll take care of those bastards on my own.

77
308
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,180
Do you know how much his hands are worth?

78
312
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,960
Even if Rodin could come back to life, I wouldn't trade it for that hand.
 Do you have any idea what you've done?!

79
317
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,740
Hang in there.

80
321
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Good morning!

81
325
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,580
Unni did you sleep well, too?

82
329
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,480
I didn't sleep a wink.

83
333
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,680
Last night was a milestone event for Goo Joon Pyo and Ha Jae Kyung.

84
337
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,860
Joon Pyo was so embarrassed, he took off first.

85
341
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,540
You two looked really good together yesterday, too.

86
345
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,140
See, wasn't it good that I suggested we come here?

87
349
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,420
Just as thread follows the needle, I'm going to take off now, too.

88
353
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,260
You two have fun and take your time coming back.

89
357
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,180
Ji Hoo, you have to make sure Jan Di has a lot of fun okay?

90
361
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,580
Uh, Unni, we, too . . .

91
365
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,962
<i>"Yoon Ji Hoo"</i>

92
369
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,420
<i>"Geum Jan Di"</i>
<i>"Praying for university acceptance"</i>

93
374
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,580
Y<i>"Yoon Ji Hoo"</i>
<i>"Praying for constant happiness."</i>

94
379
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,520
If you drink this, you're supposed to get in.

95
383
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,640
It's a good face.

96
387
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,580
That young lady's face is a lotus flower that can make muddy waters clear.

97
391
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,520
Cherish her.

98
395
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,160
Huh?

99
399
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,580
That girl is going to make a family for you.

100
403
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,700
How  come I didn't see that girl here today?

101
407
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,840
Grandma, she's not a child working here.

102
411
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,800
Of course, she's not a child.

103
415
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,780
She's all grown up, a young lady.

104
419
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,020
- I love her to pieces. 
- Uh-huh, yes.

105
424
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,880
If I had a grandson, I would love to have her for a granddaughter-in-law.

106
428
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,240
No, no, that's not going to work,

107
432
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,200
because she's already been set aside for another.

108
436
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,180
Now, please be careful.

109
440
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,500
Be careful on your way back.

110
444
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,380
I'm back.

111
448
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,119
Mom, what is all this?

112
452
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,040
Is there a war?

113
456
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,380
Jan Di, sit down there.

114
460
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,100
We have an important announcement to make.

115
464
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,740
An announcement?

116
468
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:35,260
Geum Jan Di, my eldest daughter, listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

117
472
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,200
What is it this time?

118
476
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,060
Dad, did you get into trouble again?

119
480
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,720
Do you think your dad is someone who always gets into trouble!?

120
484
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, you're right. 
 So,

121
489
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,420
in order to cut off this horrible problem at its source,

122
493
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,300
I've made a crucial decision.

123
497
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,380
- A decision? 
- Uh-huh.

124
502
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,040
Early tomorrow morning,

125
506
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:05,400
Mom and Dad have decided to move down to where your uncle lives.

126
510
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,580
What?

127
514
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,840
It's been difficult to come out from under the hardship we're in now, 
it seems that there isn't any hope for us here.

128
519
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:20,700
Mom and dad are going to head down and work on the fishing boats there
 that way we can send you money to spend.

129
524
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,960
Our living expenses will be completely covered.

130
528
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,860
But then, what about Kang San and me?

131
532
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,600
You two have to stay here and go to school.

132
536
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,780
Geum Jan Di, take good care of Kang San.

133
540
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,540
From now onwards, you are the head of the family.

134
544
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,660
Was there ever a time when nuna wasn't the head?

135
548
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,320
Ah, Mom!

136
552
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,040
Dad!

137
556
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm sorry, Jan Di.

138
560
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,120
Listen to noona.

139
564
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,340
Make sure to wash properly and...

140
568
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,540
Oh, my poor baby.

141
572
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,143
Hey!

142
576
00:21:13,143 --> 00:21:15,102
- Yes? 
- What's going on?

143
581
00:21:15,102 --> 00:21:18,159
Um, that is...

144
585
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,140
Please set it here.

145
589
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,620
This . . .

146
593
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,740
Hey, monkey.

147
597
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,580
What are you doing at someone else's house!

148
601
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,260
Oh, my husband has woken up?

149
605
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,220
You must be hungry.

150
609
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,540
Let's eat breakfast.

151
613
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,820
Here, have a seat.

152
617
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,440
What... is all of this?

153
621
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,340
What else could they be? Obviously  I prepared all of this be eaten.

154
625
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,140
There are chefs in my house.

155
629
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,900
I know, but I wanted to something for you and this was this only thing I could think of.

156
633
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,880
You and I are the same, there's never anything we need to buy or that we want right?

157
637
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,060
So I thought about what if it was me.

158
641
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,820
I thought, "What is it that I've always longed for?".

159
645
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,300
So what was it?

160
649
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,980
Initially, I wanted a happy, fulfilling breakfast table.

161
653
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,780
I hated eating all by myself at a huge table.

162
657
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,580
Since you've prepared everything, I'll eat it, but...

163
661
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,000
Really?  Then start by eating this.

164
665
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,900
This is really good.  And this is good, too.

165
669
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,780
This one.

166
673
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,540
Try to eat this.

167
677
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,900
<i>All right, eat it before this gets cold . . .</i>

168
681
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,060
You have to eat this when it's warm.

169
685
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:18,640
I was so happy when someone took the flesh off the bones and set the fish on my rice for me.

170
689
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,580
You've never done anything like this, have you?

171
693
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:32,380
Is it good?

172
697
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,180
That's a relief.

173
701
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,940
Eat this as well.

174
705
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,020
And meat too.

175
709
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,500
Do you want to try this?

176
713
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,860
My ambitious work.

177
717
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,900
Have some of these vegetable too.

178
721
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,680
Dessert's after this.

179
725
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,140
Have you tried some soup?  I made it really yummy.

180
729
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,740
Did you find anything?

181
733
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:10,480
No.

182
737
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,580
It's not really possible for there to be any.

183
741
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,960
A place with no deposit, cheap monthly rent, that's decent for a junior high 
and a high school student to live.

184
746
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,840
It's not likely.

185
750
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,240
Can't you just come to my house and live with me?

186
754
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,140
What about Kang San?

187
758
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,540
Ah yes. You have Geum Kang San.

188
762
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,460
There's no solution.

189
766
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:41,580
I'd better get going.

190
770
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,580
You're the one who needs help now.

191
774
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,140
Here's the tea.

192
778
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,228
How's your shoulder?

193
782
00:24:58,228 --> 00:25:03,940
It's better now, but now my knee is aching.

194
786
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,500
I'll get a hotpad for your knee.

195
790
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,100
Where did such a lovely sweetheart come from?

196
794
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,820
What is this?

197
798
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,920
House / Apartment

198
802
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,019
Is cutie looking for a place to stay?

199
806
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:27,660
Yes, I'm looking but it's not easy finding a cheap place.

200
810
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,580
- Wait just a moment. I'll get you a hotpad for your knee. 
- No, no.

201
815
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,260
When did you get here?

202
819
00:26:05,515 --> 00:26:06,820
Here.

203
823
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,460
What's this?

204
827
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,260
Though it's late, it's our engagement gift.

205
831
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,909
- Gift? 
- The one that our parents got is totally not my taste.

206
836
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:25,220
So, I had these made and I wanted to share them with you.

207
840
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,200
J J?

208
844
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,920
Uh-huh, Joon Pyo and Jae Kyung.

209
848
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,280
No, Jae Kyung and Joon Pyo.

210
852
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,260
Even our initials are fated, don't you think?

211
856
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,740
Put it on for me.

212
860
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,700
Where are you going?

213
864
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,960
There's a place I need to go to.

214
868
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,880
Where's that?

215
872
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,380
You're my fiancee, not my wife!

216
876
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,900
Just go home.

217
880
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,620
Don't do that.

218
884
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,900
Straighten it out with that.

219
888
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,620
It's truly fascinating.

220
892
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,300
How can something like this be made from ordinary dirt?

221
896
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:57,200
You're more fascinating. What kind of girl has no other interests apart from pottery?

222
900
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,040
Then, what about you? Is there anything you like more than pottery?

223
904
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,460
- There is. 
- A girl?

224
909
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,500
Ummm, a girl is like a math problem.

225
913
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,940
In the beginning, I wonder how I'm going to solve it.

226
917
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,340
I figured out, if I just study it a bit more, then a solution can be found.

227
921
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,880
It's pretty simple, but there's still a wonder to it.

228
925
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

229
929
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:38,360
To me, you

230
933
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:41,400
are like an unsolveable problem.

231
937
00:31:42,632 --> 00:31:43,680
What?

232
941
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,720
A problem that starts off completely twisted and can't be solved.

233
945
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:54,680
Hey, get back here.

234
949
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,520
Yi Jung!

235
953
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,020
What on earth happened?

236
957
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,560
According to Woo Bin, your hand...

237
961
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,100
It's all over.

238
965
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,740
For real?

239
969
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,080
A swimmer who hurts her shoulder and has to stop swimming...

240
973
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,200
A potter,

241
977
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,280
who ruins his hands and has to give up spinning.

242
981
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,000
Doesn't it seem like a survival documentary?

243
985
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,960
What is that supposed to mean?

244
989
00:32:55,096 --> 00:32:56,240
By any chance...

245
993
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:58,680
are you talking about Geum Jan Di?

246
997
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,960
Do we know any other swimmers besides Geum Jan Di?

247
1001
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,600
So Yi Jung,

248
1005
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,000
Tell me straight.

249
1009
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,840
What do you mean her shoulder's wrecked?

250
1013
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,120
Is this what you were talking about in Macau?

251
1017
00:33:21,526 --> 00:33:28,460
If I think about it now, you really had your wits about you, back in Macau.

252
1021
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,360
People like us can't have anything to do with stuff like...

253
1025
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,360
innocence and love.

254
1029
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,160
I said to tell it to me straight!

255
1033
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:43,640
Do you remember when Jan Di threw herself in front of that chair so you wouldn't get hurt?

256
1037
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,720
When she found out that she could never swim again,

257
1041
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,040
do you know how much Geum Jan Di cried?

258
1045
00:33:56,271 --> 00:34:00,040
Is that true?

259
1049
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,880
No matter how much of a tantrum you throw, it's still the same.

260
1053
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:13,120
People like us,

261
1057
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,680
we do nothing but hurt the women we love.

262
1061
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,360
Here, right here, Kang San.

263
1065
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,880
Is it okay? Just the two of you in living here?

264
1069
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,400
It'll be fine.  The room has a good view and it's kind of cozy, right Noona?

265
1073
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,440
Thanks, Ga Eul.  It's really late.

266
1077
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,160
- I'll go then. 
- Thanks.

267
1082
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,760
- See you, San. 
- Be careful.

268
1087
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,360
Uh-huh.

269
1091
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,860
Kang San,  are you going to be okay?

270
1095
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,240
Noona, you just don't overdo it yourself.

271
1099
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,280
Let's take care not to make our Mom and Dad worried.

272
1103
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,040
Fighting. 
 Fighting.

273
1108
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,920
- Okay, Noona, over there. 
- Let's start cleaning.

274
1113
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,842
You do.

275
1117
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:42,500
Noona, I'll get that first.

276
1121
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,400
I'm going to hang a framed picture on the wall

277
1125
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,080
Here?

278
1129
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,040
<i>Whose fault is it that Geum Jan Di can't swim anymore?!</i>

279
1133
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,440
<i>Why aren't you swimming anymore?</i>

280
1137
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,000
<i>I quit.</i>

281
1141
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,840
<i>Why would a swimmer quit swimming?</i>

282
1145
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,680
<i>It's none of your business.</i>

283
1149
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,400
Watch over Joon Pyo while I'm gone.

284
1153
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,320
You know what I mean, don't you?

285
1157
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,560
I understand.

286
1161
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,600
Get a hold of me right away if anything seems remotely strange.

287
1165
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,800
Don't worry.  Have a good trip.

288
1169
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,560
Hey, delivery girl!

289
1173
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,540
One milk for me, too.

290
1177
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,640
Hurry up and throw it-- one milk.

291
1181
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,940
Big brother Joon Pyo?

292
1185
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,100
Hey! Goo Joon Pyo!

293
1189
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,280
What are you doing here?

294
1193
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,440
So, is there anything weird about me being at my own house?

295
1197
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,600
Your house?

296
1201
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,580
From today on, I've decided to live here.

297
1205
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:55,320
Why?  Why would you live here?

298
1209
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,520
Shall we say it's some kind of preparation for independence?

299
1213
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,360
Why on earth would you do something like that here?

300
1217
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,700
Don't you watch any dramas?

301
1221
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,380
It's pretty standard procedure to toughen up the princely heir, to train him.

302
1225
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,980
Haven't you heard about deliberately throwing the son off a cliff?

303
1229
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:28,440
- Where was that?  Ssss... S...
- Sparta?

304
1234
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,464
Yes, that's right.

305
1238
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:36,720
Hey little bro.  Don't study all by yourself.  Help your sister to study too.

306
1242
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,160
It's hard to communicate when we're on such totally different livers.

307
1246
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,520
Different livers?

308
1250
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,240
Different levels.

309
1254
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,360
Whatever training thing you're doing, I wish you well, but could you get out already?

310
1258
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,720
We are a little busy here.

311
1262
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,480
What?

312
1266
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,520
Regardless, we're neighbors now.

313
1270
00:41:04,702 --> 00:41:06,480
Let's try to be good neighbors.

314
1274
00:41:07,336 --> 00:41:09,317
If you have any difficulties, I'll help.

315
1278
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,800
Can I reject that request?

316
1282
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:54,080
What I've just shown you is the wheel procedure and what you are doing is the coiling procedure...

317
1286
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:02,920
Pay attention to the details, please.

318
1290
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,840
That's it for today.

319
1294
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,560
Thank you.

320
1298
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,720
Confess.

321
1302
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,840
Huh?

322
1306
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,960
Hurry up and confess your feelings to him before it's too late.

323
1310
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,360
The thing is...

324
1314
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:41,320
I'm a little scared.

325
1318
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,360
He's totally different from me.

326
1322
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:52,760
The thing is, love cannot be achieved by patience.

327
1326
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,000
You can't hide it because you want to.

328
1330
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,480
Anyway, why did you break up with your lover, teacher?

329
1334
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,120
I wanted to stay by his side, the way he wanted me to, but...

330
1338
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,400
I wasn't able to do that.

331
1342
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:20,720
Because I kept wanting more, and it was too hard.

332
1346
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,960
Did you confess your feelings?

333
1350
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,240
I wonder... did I confess?

334
1354
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:35,000
If you don't want to regret it later, like I do. 
 Then Ga Eul, you should build up your courage 
and confess your feelings.

335
1360
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,040
What is all this?

336
1364
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,540
Hey! What kind of student comes back so late?

337
1368
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,253
When you're done, you should hurry up and come home..

338
1372
00:43:54,253 --> 00:43:58,880
Hey! By any chance, did you buy all this stuff?

339
1376
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,800
Oh, this?  I couldn't use it all by myself, so I threw it away here.

340
1380
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,160
Threw away?

341
1384
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,720
But...

342
1388
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,400
what's that smell?

343
1392
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,080
Looks yummy.

344
1396
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,680
Kang San, watch out since it's hot.

345
1400
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,880
Why? What?

346
1404
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,480
Yours seems more tasty.

347
1408
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,460
What?  Did I cook mine separately?  It's the same as yours.

348
1412
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,880
Give that to me.

349
1416
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,000
Hurry up and hand it over!!

350
1420
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,760
Mmmmm, hey, don't!

351
1424
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,240
That was really delicious!

352
1428
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,160
Little bro isn't there any more?

353
1432
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:56,380
Because of you, we didn't get more than one mouthful!

354
1436
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,720
All this time, you guys planned to keep this delicious food to yourselves?

355
1440
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,880
That's awfully childish, between neighbors.

356
1444
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,120
Are you done eating?

357
1448
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,640
Then you can leave. Go!

358
1452
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,760
Little bro, don't you have more ramen?

359
1456
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,960
What's up?

360
1460
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,400
I don't like people who come over without a reason.

361
1464
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,400
I do have 
. . . a reason.

362
1469
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,280
With me,

363
1473
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,040
Will you go on a date with me?

364
1477
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,440
A date?

365
1481
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,800
Didn't we already do that last time?

366
1485
00:46:46,636 --> 00:46:50,640
Not a fake one.  A real date.

367
1489
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,960
Ga Eul, did something shocking happen to you?

368
1493
00:46:57,682 --> 00:47:00,860
Or, did you get dumped by some guy?

369
1497
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,880
I'm not kidding.

370
1501
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,680
I . . .

371
1505
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,040
I like you, Yi Jung Sunbae.

372
1509
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,860
Thank you.

373
1513
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,000
Thanks, but...

374
1517
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,080
I have a few rules when it comes to dating.

375
1521
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,760
Rules?

376
1525
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:35,540
One. I don't mess with good girls.

377
1529
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:39,400
Two. I also don't mess with idiotic girls.

378
1533
00:47:40,513 --> 00:47:46,520
Three. Never mess with girls related to my friends.

379
1537
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,160
Ga Eul, you go against all 3 rules.

380
1541
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,760
You know that, right?

381
1545
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,680
Hence, my answer is, "No."

382
1549
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,700
Sunbae.

383
1553
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,800
You know where the exit is, right?

384
1557
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:38,340
Argh!  What the heck is this? Ahhh!

385
1561
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,600
Hey! Aishhh, what is that?

386
1565
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,920
AH~~ What's that!

387
1569
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,200
Help me!!

388
1573
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,200
Hey! Don't come!

389
1577
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,240
Hey! Goo Joon Pyo, what's wrong? Are you okay?

390
1581
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,840
Hey! That thing...

391
1585
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,840
Is this ok?

392
1589
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,780
I couldn't study because you are so noisy.

393
1593
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,520
Such things are a nuisance in this neighborhood.

394
1597
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,200
If you do this one more time, I'm going to call the police!

395
1601
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,680
Hey, Geum Jan Di.

396
1605
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,460
Why! What?!

397
1609
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,520
Wait,

398
1613
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,200
Can you stay for a little while?

399
1617
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,160
Unni!

400
1621
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,720
Jan Di!

401
1625
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,700
Why didn't you tell me you moved?

402
1629
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,200
How did you find out?

403
1633
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,220
I went to your house but no one was there so I asked Ga Eul.

404
1637
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:50,660
I heard about your parents. Are you okay?

405
1641
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,500
But what is all this?

406
1645
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,720
Moving presents!

407
1649
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:58,840
Moving presents?

408
1653
00:53:00,649 --> 00:53:04,460
Chen, wait in the car. 
 Yes, miss.

409
1658
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,240
So this is the neigborhood rooftop house.

410
1662
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,880
It's really romantic.

411
1666
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:21,340
Ah, sorry. If it hurt your feelings, I'm sorry.

412
1670
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,780
I really didn't mean that.

413
1674
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,840
I know.

414
1678
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,880
It's cold. Do you want a cup of tea before you leave?

415
1682
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,060
Is that okay?

416
1686
00:53:31,573 --> 00:53:34,223
Here. Sit here.

417
1690
00:53:34,698 --> 00:53:38,080
Okay. Are you sure its ok?

418
1694
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,440
Is this your new way of waking people up?

419
1698
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,680
I didn't know you were interested in art.

420
1702
00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:45,540
Ah, this?

421
1706
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:50,980
I was supposed to go to a showing and write an art report, but it ended.

422
1710
00:55:51,271 --> 00:55:55,320
But it was so expensive, I probably wouldn't have been able to go anyway.

423
1714
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,418
So I thought I'd look at this book and write it.

424
1718
00:55:58,372 --> 00:56:00,260
When is it due?

425
1722
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,600
Huh?

426
1726
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,800
When is that report due?

427
1730
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,580
There is no exhibition today.

428
1734
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,660
Come in..

429
1738
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,140
Do you want that one?

430
1742
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,800
Uh, no.

431
1746
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,780
This is good enough for me.

432
1750
00:58:21,428 --> 00:58:24,859
Do you know by chance,

433
1754
00:58:24,859 --> 00:58:29,220
why the lotus blooms in the mud?

434
1758
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,580
What?

435
1762
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,500
Never mind.

436
1766
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,300
That girl is like the lotus flower, able to clear a  muddy water.

437
1770
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,809
- Cherish her. 
- Pardon me?

438
1775
00:58:48,809 --> 00:58:52,740
That girl will make a family for you.

439
1779
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,351
Now I've become your model as well?

440
1783
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,240
Did you just wake up?

441
1787
00:59:54,544 --> 00:59:58,880
If I'd only known, then I would have made a book.

442
1791
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,460
What kind of book?

443
1795
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:09,520
An accounting book for all the money I should collect from Geum Jan Di:  transportation fee, coffee,

444
1799
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,880
for this exhibiton, and now modeling fees.

445
1803
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,480
If I add it all up, it should be a big lump sum.

446
1807
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:21,600
Well, here's the modeling fee for a start.

447
1811
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,180
Since it's drawn so well...

448
1815
01:00:35,662 --> 01:00:37,800
I should give you something in return.

449
1819
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,040
Here.

450
1823
01:01:07,578 --> 01:01:09,680
The lotus flower,

451
1827
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,640
clears and refreshes even in the muddiest of waters.

452
1831
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,760
The name is pretty and its function is pretty too.

453
1835
01:01:21,933 --> 01:01:23,600
Just like you.

454
1839
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,040
Huh?

455
1843
01:01:26,209 --> 01:01:27,200
That's it.

456
1847
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,080
The answer to my homework.

457
1851
01:01:29,757 --> 01:01:30,960
Homework?

458
1855
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:40,140
The more I see you, the more I'm reminded of the lotus flower.

459
1859
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,280
Lotus flower?

460
1863
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,200
Do you know why the lotus blooms in mud?

461
1867
01:01:46,153 --> 01:01:46,698
Huh?

462
1871
01:01:46,698 --> 01:01:49,360
That's your homework until next time.

463
1875
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,320
Thanks for the present!

464
1879
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,500
(What homework?)

465
1883
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,940
What about the witch?

466
1887
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,540
She's still in Vancouver.

467
1891
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,720
- Help cover things up for me. 
- I understand.

1896
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,881
Goo Joon Pyo!

469
1900
01:02:13,881 --> 01:02:17,160
Please, you really can't do this.

470
1904
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,700
Goo Joon Pyo!

471
1908
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,760
Hey, you again?

472
1912
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,700
Obviously, the two of us connect.

473
1916
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,360
For some reason, I just felt that if I came by the house, I'd get to see you.

474
1920
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,160
Did you boil your cell phone or put it somewhere?

475
1924
01:02:32,811 --> 01:02:35,720
You're supposed to call and get permission to visit before going to someone's house.

476
1928
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,260
Didn't you learn stuff like that?

477
1932
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,160
Oh, I'm tired!

478
1936
01:02:41,914 --> 01:02:45,480
Now that I think about it, I don't recall ever learning anything like that.

479
1940
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,520
Joon Pyo, do you do that?

480
1944
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,320
Hey, monkey.

481
1948
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,780
Aren't you getting up?

482
1952
01:02:51,206 --> 01:02:53,060
Why are you lying down on my bed?

483
1956
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:56,580
Get up, hurry!

484
1960
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,920
Get up! Hurry!

485
1964
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,640
Get up!

486
1968
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,940
Do you want to make a bet with me?

487
1972
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:41,720
It's so quiet, it's making me antsy.

488
1976
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,760
I have one question for you.  Will you answer?

489
1980
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,820
Love or friendship . . .

490
1984
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:53,000
if you had to pick just one, which would you choose?

491
1988
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,600
You put too much pressure on your wrist.

492
1992
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,380
Yi Jung Sunbae!

493
1996
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,100
This . . .

494
2000
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,380
Isn't it pretty?

495
2004
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,800
It seems like Joon Pyo hyung still likes you, noona!

496
2008
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,334
Is there nothing more you should report to me? 
 No.

497
2013
01:04:13,334 --> 01:04:15,960
Go find out immediately.

498
2017
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,660
This is Geum Jan Di, who will be staying here from today.

499
2021
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:22,020
Where did you get someone who can't even memorize the menu?

500
2025
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,820
Please look favorably on me.

501
2029
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:28,960
My private maid?
