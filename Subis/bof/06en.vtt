1
3
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,367
How did you do this?

2
7
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:36,773
Didn't I tell you? Every day, you'll be able to enjoy things you can't even imagine.

3
11
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:40,745
Jan Di Baht (weed), you're shocked.  Are you that easy to impress?

4
15
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:42,347
This was easy?

5
19
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:47,184
If  you're done being touched, let's get to the point.

6
23
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:49,119
The... the point??

7
27
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:56,594
What are you doing right now?

8
31
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,265
Ddd...don't take off your clothes!!

9
35
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:06,770
Is he up to something?

10
39
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,612
YOU! 
Don't take your clothes off! I'll you do... I'll kill you!!!

11
44
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:23,487
YOU! If you take off your pants, too...I'll really kill you! I told you not to take them off!!

12
48
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:29,494
Pervert! 
 Hey!! I told you not to take them off!

13
53
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:31,796
Dummy!!

14
57
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,908
-Come here, you dummy! 
-Do you want to die? 
 -Surprising people like that!

15
63
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:55,419
Goo Joon Pyo, don't move. Wait there!

16
67
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:59,890
-What's wrong? 
Don't move!!
-What is it? What's wrong?

17
73
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:09,400
There...there's a snake by your leg.

18
77
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,501
What?!

19
81
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:18,342
By your leg...snake!

20
85
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:22,013
Ah! 
I really hate snakes!


21
91
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:31,823
Run fast, Goo Joon Pyo! 
Keep running!

22
96
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:37,529
-What? 
 -Go on! Run farther! 
 You're doing well!

23
102
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:55,546
Madam... the juice you ordered is here.

24
106
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:57,682
Put it over there...

25
110
00:03:57,682 --> 00:04:01,117
Okay..

26
114
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:04,320
Enjoy...

27
118
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,990
Tip..

28
122
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,693
Thank you, madam

29
126
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:16,800
Wait a second. 
Yes ma'am. 
 If you have the time, why don't you rub this on for me?

30
132
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,905
That would be my pleasure, Madam.

31
136
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:27,912
Mom!

32
140
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:35,053
The chicken store's owner said if you are not going to order chicken then to  put the parasol back. WHAT?!

33
144
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:43,661
One whole chicken?! Do you know how much chicken soup you could buy with that? 
Strike! Strike!

34
149
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:45,639
Then how about this...

35
153
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:50,863
Hey, Gang San.

36
157
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:55,005
My sweet Gang San.

37
161
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:56,741
What are you doing to him?

38
165
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:16,761
Do you want me to put it on for you?

39
169
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:18,329
It's ok!

40
173
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:31,175
My baby, your skin is just like a baby's skin.

41
177
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:32,610
What the heck?

42
181
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:40,948
Jan Di! 
Jan Di!

43
186
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:43,721
Hey, that's enough, come out now!

44
190
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:52,962
Jan Di!

45
194
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:58,434
Stop it now!

46
198
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:10,448
Jan Di! 
What's wrong? 
Jan Di!
 - What is it?

47
205
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:16,353
Jan Di! 
Oh, what should I do!?

48
210
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:17,455
What? What's going on?

49
214
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:22,326
Something is wrong with Jan Di.

50
218
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:30,701
Jan Di!

51
222
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:42,040
Jan Di, wake up! 
Wake up!

52
227
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:48,046
Are you okay?

53
231
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:32,889
Madam President.

54
235
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:36,060
Where did Joon Pyo go?

55
239
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,131
From the report from the private plane, he left for New Caledonia at 5.

56
243
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:41,432
Why did he go there?

57
247
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:45,402
He went for some fresh air and for a weekend trip.

58
251
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:48,505
I got it.

59
255
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:51,508
Hold on.

60
259
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:55,377
Did you check on who else went?

61
263
00:08:55,377 --> 00:09:00,217
Yes, I did. 
As usual, he went with F4.

62
268
00:09:00,217 --> 00:09:08,391
F4.  When is he ever going to quit being the leader of that childish group?

63
272
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:10,728
You can leave.

64
276
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:54,706
Help me!  Mom, Dad, Noona, help me!

65
280
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:02,380
For someone who is so well off, how come he doesn't know how to swim?

66
284
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,316
-He was kidnapped when he was 8 years old. 
 -Huh?

67
289
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:11,288
When he was young, there was this guy who looked after him instead of his parents. 
 He was a bodyguard and a driver.

68
294
00:10:11,288 --> 00:10:13,357
So that person was the criminal?

69
298
00:10:13,357 --> 00:10:17,094
The police were chasing after a car, and it crashed into the water.

70
302
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:18,295
No way!

71
306
00:10:18,295 --> 00:10:22,099
Yeah, Jun Pyo was in that car.

72
310
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:53,997
What happened?

73
314
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:56,804
I just gave some extra consideration in preparing something for you guys.

74
318
00:10:56,804 --> 00:10:59,904
Well, I guess this is for someone else though.

75
322
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:01,405
Who cares.

76
326
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:03,174
Looks delicious!

77
330
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:03,641
Come here.

78
334
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:07,510
Why? Let go of me! 
Ah, it hurts!

79
339
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,183
This is all for you.

80
343
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:17,787
Do you see me as some kind of Godzilla?

81
347
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:20,018
It's good for your health, so eat it.

82
351
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:23,722
You're always eating some kind of weird bugs. 
 That's why your legs are so weak

83
356
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:25,657
Weird bugs?

84
360
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:29,661
Anyway, does it make sense for a swimmer to drown?

85
364
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:32,197
If all of the sudden you get a Jui(cramp), then it does make sense.

86
368
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:39,204
Jui(Rat) or cat, I won't allow you to be weak when you're with me. 
So stop talking so much, and just eat it, okay?

87
373
00:12:46,038 --> 00:12:50,576
- How are you?
- You're not here with the pretty unni?

88
378
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:57,482
Give this to the one you love.

89
382
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:36,555
Are you going to eat all of that?

90
386
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:42,326
But Joon Pyo doesn't like plump girls.

91
390
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:43,428
Huh?

92
394
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:48,999
But the pajamas in my luggage will probably be a lot of help.

93
398
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:50,968
Pajamas?

94
402
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:57,409
Right now he is into Jan Di, but with his personality, nobody knows what will happen.

95
406
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:59,411
What are you saying?

96
410
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:06,784
Guys that get rejected become weak...  
 I believe you can compete against it. 
Good luck!

97
416
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:10,655
What in the world are you saying right now?

98
420
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:13,958
Ga Eul, don't you like Joon Pyo?

99
424
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:21,032
Oh my God
 Look here, I have my own tastes too you know.

100
429
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:26,438
Then why were you so upset that an accident was going to happen between Joon Pyo and Jan Di?

101
433
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:35,580
Unless you like Jan Di?

102
437
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,651
Well there's someone Jan Di likes.

103
441
00:14:45,257 --> 00:14:50,896
Hey, So Yi Jung, come over here. 
Hurry.

104
446
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:38,543
Show time!

105
450
00:15:56,895 --> 00:16:02,634
Goo Joon Pyo,  from now on I'll put you on the player's list.

106
454
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:57,421
What is she doing in there?

107
458
00:16:57,421 --> 00:17:03,495
Hey! I thought you passed out in there. Were you scrubbing yourself or something? 
What took you so long?

108
463
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:04,666
You!

109
467
00:17:12,238 --> 00:17:16,341
This jerk wants to die! He's so dead!

110
471
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:20,478
This isn't your room, it's my room!

111
475
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:21,747
Did I say it wasn't?

112
479
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:24,547
Then why are you here?

113
483
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:26,118
Do you really think I'd show up here for no reason?

114
487
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:30,889
Reason? What reason?

115
491
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:43,601
- You're losing something important.
- Important?

116
496
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:46,501
As a woman

117
500
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:49,641
As a woman.
Could it be ...

118
505
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:06,358
Goo Joon Pyo, really, what are you doing!

119
509
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:15,232
Cheap things look good on you.

120
513
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,544
What, did you think I was going to do something to you?

121
517
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:32,550
I wouldn't mess around with a girl that didn't love me.

122
521
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,762
Even though it's cheap, you better not lose it, or else you're dead!

123
525
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:27,439
Ga Eul, are you awake?

124
529
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:32,877
Ga Eul, are you sleeping? 
Ga Eul!

125
534
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:42,912
Do you know the meaning of this flower?

126
538
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:48,386
Without a doubt, happiness will come.

127
542
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:55,660
That is why it's only given to the person you love.

128
546
00:20:57,395 --> 00:21:00,164
You know about it

129
550
00:21:00,164 --> 00:21:02,433
From today, at the market.

130
554
00:21:03,835 --> 00:21:11,776
I came here often with her. She said it was similar to Nice, so she liked it.

131
558
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:14,612
Is she doing well? (talking about Min Seo Hyun)

132
562
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:20,285
I guess she's doing well.

133
566
00:21:23,354 --> 00:21:26,157
Did something happen?

134
570
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:30,628
Why did you tell me to follow her?

135
574
00:21:30,628 --> 00:21:31,364
That 's because. . .

136
578
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:47,311
I found out what a pathetic man I was. 
All day long in an empty apartment.

137
583
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:49,848
There was nothing else to do besides waiting.

138
587
00:21:51,502 --> 00:21:55,707
But, just being able to be together would've been enough.

139
591
00:21:55,707 --> 00:22:01,279
Do you know what it feels like to be a burden to the one you love?

140
595
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:08,687
A no-good, lousy guy.

141
599
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:09,926
What I meant was . . .

142
603
00:22:09,926 --> 00:22:21,598
You're right. 
Besides loving a girl out of habit,

143
608
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:25,470
I'm a pathetic guy who doesn't know how to do anything else.

144
612
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:34,246
Take it.

145
616
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:41,902
I can't accept it.

146
620
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,624
This belongs to SeoHyun unni. 
Sunbae, you should give it to her personally.

147
625
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,934
I'll get going. Sunbae, you'll catch a cold if stay out too long too.

148
629
00:23:05,463 --> 00:23:13,785
I'm cold. 
I'm so cold that I can't handle it anymore.

149
634
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:06,237
Why didn't you tell me where you were going? I was worried!

150
638
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:14,645
Am I a kid? 
 I can take walks by myself!

151
643
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:19,217
I figured the worst that maybe you fell in the water or got bit by a snake!  
How could I not be worried?

152
648
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:25,924
Goo Joon Pyo!

153
652
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:30,595
I'm sorry.

154
656
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:47,846
You. 
From now onwards, don't go swimming alone.

155
661
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:50,081
Don't even take walks alone.

156
665
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:51,916
Understand?

157
669
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,411
What?

158
673
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:16,467
It's hot. Be careful.

159
677
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:18,769
Do you want some?

160
681
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:20,672
No, it's okay.

161
685
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,476
Where is it?

162
689
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:35,512
- What? 
 The thing I gave you.

163
694
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:45,589
Ah, that. I left it in the room. 
You think you'd let me be if I lost it while running around?

164
699
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:48,193
As long as you know, it's fine.

165
703
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:55,099
Grab it tightly.

166
707
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:56,501
Tighter.

167
711
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,749
What is that?
 It doesn't suit you.

168
716
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,352
Is that so?

169
720
00:29:21,352 --> 00:29:23,120
You like it?

170
724
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,426
What is it?
It belongs to Jan Di.

171
729
00:29:28,426 --> 00:29:31,963
She dropped it last night, pass it along to her for me.

172
733
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:46,477
Goo Joon Pyo, why didn't you pass!

173
737
00:29:57,621 --> 00:30:01,959
<i>Am I a kid? 
 I can take walks by myself!</i>

174
742
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:12,870
<i>Ah, that. I left it in the room. 
You think you'd let me be if I lost it while running around?</i>

175
747
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,106
Joon Pyo!  The ball!

176
751
00:30:22,813 --> 00:30:25,750
Joon Pyo! Are you alright?

177
755
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,286
I'm fine. I'm fine.

178
759
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:34,092
I'm fine

179
763
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:39,357
Where did Ji Hoo go?

180
767
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,426
That way.

181
771
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,326
Are you going somewhere?

182
775
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:05,329
Fishing. 
 With this boat?

183
780
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:12,568
With this white sail and the wind, we can go anywhere.

184
784
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:17,673
You wanna go too?

185
788
00:34:17,673 --> 00:34:18,978
Is that okay?

186
792
00:34:18,978 --> 00:34:23,045
If you promise that you won't be noisy and scare the fish away.

187
796
00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:00,316
You let this go.

188
800
00:35:00,316 --> 00:35:01,845
Just let it go like that?

189
804
00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:06,255
For something  that lived here for so long, are you saying that we should make this into sushi or something?

190
808
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:17,897
Bye fish!

191
812
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:19,969
Goodbye!

192
816
00:35:52,462 --> 00:35:54,103
You are putting in a lot of effort.

193
820
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:21,496
Why do you keep following me?

194
824
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:27,003
It will be too much for you. 
Even though your legs look strong enough.

195
829
00:36:35,876 --> 00:36:40,882
So, should we continue our conversation from last night?

196
833
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:43,251
What conversation?

197
837
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:48,790
Is it true that Geum Jan Di, likes another guy?

198
841
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,293
When did I ever say such thing?

199
845
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,563
Who is it?

200
849
00:36:54,563 --> 00:36:59,300
Stop saying nonsense and just peddle!

201
853
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:09,779
It's probably some low-life.  I know a little about women and Geum Jan Di's type is attracted to bad boys.

202
857
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:15,784
Guys like that like to leech off of strong women like Jan Di and suck everything out of them.

203
861
00:37:15,784 --> 00:37:20,356
Nonsense! That guy might be Jan Di's soulmate.

204
865
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:29,731
Soulmate?

205
869
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:32,367
That's why it isn't working out with them.

206
873
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:35,703
Do you actually believe in such a thing?

207
877
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:46,114
Of course! Definitely! 
Playboys like you wouldn't understand, 
but that one person does exist in this universe.

208
883
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:52,020
So, have you met yours Ga Eul?  Your soulmate?

209
887
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,422
Not yet,

210
891
00:37:53,422 --> 00:37:59,760
but if he appears, I'm not letting him go.

211
895
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,601
Because if you lose that person, you will eternally regret it.

212
899
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:15,544
What are you doing just sitting there?
 I have been paddling this whole time alone.

213
904
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:29,692
Hurry up.

214
908
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:51,346
Where are we going?

215
912
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:53,315
I have something to show you.

216
916
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:32,955
Look down.

217
920
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:46,768
Wow, it's a heart!

218
924
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:50,271
It's really shaped like a heart.

219
928
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:56,345
I decided if I ever found a girl I liked, I'd bring her here.

220
932
00:40:03,283 --> 00:40:06,522
Do you see it? My heart?

221
936
00:40:33,782 --> 00:40:34,616
What's the matter?

222
940
00:40:34,616 --> 00:40:35,885
An emergency regarding Ji Hoo.

223
944
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:41,357
Here.

224
948
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:52,267
He's an elite politician. And he might be the next prime minister.

225
952
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:56,939
Ji Hoo seems to have known about this since before he came back from Paris. 
-I didn't see him this afternoon.

226
957
00:40:56,939 --> 00:41:02,344
His stuff is still in his room. 
What should we do?

227
962
00:41:02,344 --> 00:41:05,748
He's going to be fine.
 I know him.

228
967
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:21,830
Your prince, now I understand why he's changed.

229
971
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,667
Ga Eul . . .

230
975
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,269
what should I do?

231
979
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:29,804
What?

232
983
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:38,747
What I said before, it's coming true. 
Ji Hoo sunbae is going to really hate me.

233
988
00:41:48,855 --> 00:41:57,113
<i>I hope she marries someone of royalty or someone who may become president.</i>

234
992
00:41:57,113 --> 00:42:05,508
<i>Like Diana or Audrey Hepburn. To be a princess who contributes to world peace  Something like that.</i>

235
996
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:11,545
<i>She's just a model.</i>

236
1000
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:17,419
<i>Why does that matter? The president of France divorced so he could marry a model.</i>

237
1004
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:24,293
<i>Who knows, a French President or a European prince might pick unnie.</i>

238
1008
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:41,443
How did you get in here?

239
1012
00:42:41,443 --> 00:42:44,913
Have you forgotten who owns this place?

240
1016
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:56,527
Geum Jan Di.

241
1020
00:42:58,163 --> 00:43:05,869
My heart... you understand right?

242
1024
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:07,506
Huh?

243
1028
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:25,257
Don't keep me waiting too long.

244
1032
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:11,335
Is it true?

245
1036
00:44:11,335 --> 00:44:16,441
It's just a rumor, right? 
It's just a false report, right??

246
1041
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:22,813
I'm sorry.

247
1045
00:44:22,813 --> 00:44:24,382
Really ...

248
1049
00:44:24,382 --> 00:44:30,222
I guess you just knew her better than me.

249
1053
00:44:30,222 --> 00:44:32,190
Sunbae.

250
1057
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,693
He is a man fit for Seo Hyun.

251
1061
00:44:35,693 --> 00:44:38,363
I don't hold a candle to him.

252
1065
00:44:38,363 --> 00:44:41,767
That's not true! 
There's no way for it to be true!

253
1070
00:45:04,322 --> 00:45:08,493
Please, be happy.

254
1074
00:45:08,493 --> 00:45:11,463
Tell me that you will be.

255
1078
00:45:17,285 --> 00:45:22,274
Because if you are unhappy, then I'll be unhappy as too.

256
1082
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:27,012
Why couldn't I have fallen for a girl like you?

257
1086
00:46:06,985 --> 00:46:11,959
So, this is how it is?

258
1090
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:23,897
Goo Joon Pyo, don't do this!  This . . .

259
1094
00:46:23,897 --> 00:46:30,241
This what? 
 You didn't know about this either? 
 Did you fall for another trap?

260
1100
00:46:33,344 --> 00:46:42,548
I wanted to believe you, I didn't want to regret later on, so I tried my best.

261
1104
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,660
I'm sorry.  It's...

262
1108
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,530
I showed you my heart

263
1112
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:57,402
But... Is this your answer?

264
1116
00:46:58,637 --> 00:47:01,740
It's not like that.
 It's not...

265
1121
00:47:10,615 --> 00:47:13,185
Now, this time it really is the end.

266
1125
00:47:15,476 --> 00:47:19,891
Geum Jan Di, l don't ever want to see you again.

267
1129
00:47:24,596 --> 00:47:26,364
Joon Pyo!
 Shut up!

268
1134
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:39,845
If I hear one word from you 
 I'll kill you.

269
1139
00:48:06,036 --> 00:48:15,079
Where did he go?  What time did he leave?  Ten o'clock?   I got it.

270
1143
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:17,616
What? 
He really left?

271
1148
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:20,819
Yeah, by a jet at dawn.

272
1152
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:25,624
Crazy fool. 
What is he thinking?

273
1157
00:48:25,624 --> 00:48:28,058
Geum Jan Di.

274
1161
00:48:28,058 --> 00:48:30,028
Do you know anything about this?

275
1165
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:43,742
Jan Di!

276
1169
00:49:21,312 --> 00:49:22,809
I'm home!

277
1173
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,451
Jan Di!

278
1177
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:32,289
Jan Di, you must be exhausted.

279
1181
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:40,732
This was your first vacation overseas, and in a private plane across the Pacific Ocean! 
What kind of blessing was this?

280
1186
00:49:40,732 --> 00:49:45,837
It's been hard on you, my daughter
Seeing that you have this much prospects, I can die in peace!

281
1191
00:49:45,837 --> 00:49:48,540
Why do you have to die? It's only the beginning.

282
1195
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:53,845
If Jan Di becomes part of that house she'll have everything. She'll live without regrets.

283
1199
00:49:53,845 --> 00:49:57,217
I have a lot of regrets. 
  Honey . . .

284
1204
00:49:57,217 --> 00:50:02,284
Noona, does that island really belongs to Joon Pyo Hyungnim?
(*hyungnim = brother-in-law)

285
1209
00:50:02,284 --> 00:50:06,925
Really?  It's theirs?  There's nothing Shin Hwa Group doesn't have!  He's a prince!

286
1213
00:50:06,925 --> 00:50:13,967
-Then if Jan Di got married what would she become?
-A princess.
-Princess? *headache*

287
1219
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:16,000
Please calm down, the prince's mother-in-law.

288
1223
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,435
Will I become the prince's mother-in-law?

289
1227
00:50:17,435 --> 00:50:20,305
Dad, dad, then what would I be?

290
1231
00:50:20,305 --> 00:50:30,114
When you see the historical dramas, the brother of the princess is always causing trouble... 
Geum Gang San, be careful!

291
1236
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:32,250
Well, you don't have to worry about any of that.

292
1240
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,818
Why?

293
1244
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:40,625
That household, no. There's no reason for me to have any relation with Goo Joon Pyo.

294
1248
00:50:44,562 --> 00:50:47,032
Just wake up from your dream!

295
1252
00:50:49,434 --> 00:50:52,939
Hey!

296
1256
00:51:40,818 --> 00:51:44,522
<i>That  . . . 
Isn't it pretty?</i>

297
1261
00:51:44,522 --> 00:51:52,328
<i>I bought it at a shack. You're supposed to give this to the person you want to always be with.</i>

298
1265
00:51:52,328 --> 00:51:55,166
<i>Does it mean not to run away?</i>

299
1269
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:34,906
<i>Don't drink when I'm not around.</i>

300
1273
00:52:34,906 --> 00:52:38,443
<i>If it's snowing, you should go inside somewhere!</i>

301
1277
00:52:38,443 --> 00:52:43,515
<i>I was waiting for you! 
This is the first time I had to wait for someone in my entire life!</i>

302
1282
00:52:52,156 --> 00:52:54,291
<i>Wow, it's a heart!</i>

303
1286
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:56,661
<i>Do you see it? My heart?</i>

304
1290
00:52:59,463 --> 00:53:08,038
Sorry 
I'm sorry, Goo Joon Pyo.

305
1295
00:53:08,038 --> 00:53:10,508
I'm sorry.

306
1299
00:53:16,514 --> 00:53:19,116
Stay.

307
1303
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:23,988
You don't have to worry about me . . .

308
1307
00:53:23,988 --> 00:53:25,556
It seems you're in trouble too.

309
1311
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:32,512
You were always in trouble, weren't you?

310
1315
00:53:35,344 --> 00:53:37,279
I'm sorry for what happened at the island.

311
1319
00:53:37,279 --> 00:53:38,981
Why are you apologizing?

312
1323
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:41,317
If I didn't look for you . . .

313
1327
00:53:41,317 --> 00:53:45,987
I was the one who wanted to do that, and I'm the one who should be apologizing.

314
1331
00:53:45,987 --> 00:53:49,825
I was the one who hurt Goo Joon Pyo.

315
1335
00:54:11,413 --> 00:54:17,384
Joon Pyo must be looking like this right now.

316
1339
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:18,587
Of course not.

317
1343
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:31,899
He's got this dirty look on his face,

318
1347
00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:36,469
and his face is steaming red.

319
1351
00:54:36,469 --> 00:54:41,076
His hair is curly.  Curly, curly, curly . . .

320
1355
00:55:05,768 --> 00:55:07,169
I'm sorry.

321
1359
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:19,615
It's alright.

322
1363
00:55:52,111 --> 00:55:57,551
On behalf of F4, I have an announcement.

323
1367
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:04,493
From now onwards, Yoon Ji Hoo is no longer a part of F4.

324
1371
00:56:04,493 --> 00:56:07,962
- What? 
Joon Pyo!

325
1376
00:56:07,962 --> 00:56:17,339
And. In a week's time, Yoon Ji Hoo and Geum Jan Di will be expelled from this school.

326
1380
00:56:43,764 --> 00:56:44,866
Expelled?

327
1384
00:56:44,866 --> 00:56:46,101
Yes, expelled!

328
1388
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:47,569
Don't you understand what that means?

329
1392
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:48,674
You're being kicked out!

330
1396
00:56:48,674 --> 00:56:52,174
I don't care about you being kicked out but,

331
1400
00:56:52,174 --> 00:56:57,177
because of someone like you, Ji Hoo is being kicked out of F4! What are you going to do about that?

332
1404
00:56:57,177 --> 00:57:02,351
It was the start of bad things happening the moment someone like you stepped foot in this school.

333
1408
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:18,833
This is the first time Ji Hoo and Joon Pyo have come across a commoner. They must have felt bad because they are so pure hearted.
Take responsibility!  A cheap girl like you ripping F4 apart!  Take responsibility for everything!                       .

334
1413
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:21,303
I'll take that responsibility.

335
1417
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:30,112
What do you want me to do?

336
1421
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:33,215
Sunbae, are you in your right mind?!

337
1425
00:57:33,215 --> 00:57:34,950
Aren't you guys the ones who aren't in your right mind?!

338
1429
00:57:37,553 --> 00:57:42,591
Cheap girl? When you guys talk like that it makes it seem like you're the ones who are cheap.

339
1433
00:57:42,591 --> 00:57:49,164
Sunbae!  If you keep siding with her, we can't be on your side anymore!

340
1437
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:51,033
Who asked you to be?

341
1441
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:55,804
You're going to regret this!   Really!

342
1445
00:58:07,582 --> 00:58:10,952
You can quit with that face now.

343
1449
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:18,760
This time, both of us are in trouble.

344
1453
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:29,605
Well for me, it's okay to be expelled or kicked out, but for you, sunbae, this can't happen to you.

345
1457
00:58:29,605 --> 00:58:33,742
Even if he's Goo Joon Pyo, he can't do that, right?

346
1461
00:58:33,742 --> 00:58:35,110
Yes, he can.

347
1465
00:58:36,545 --> 00:58:43,051
There's Shin Hwa Group behind Joon Pyo.  Did you forget whose school this is?

348
1469
00:58:46,855 --> 00:58:49,324
Don't make that face.

349
1473
00:58:49,324 --> 00:58:52,227
I won't sit back and do nothing while being attacked.

350
1477
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:55,629
Do you have a plan?

351
1481
00:58:55,629 --> 00:59:02,237
I'll have to make because now I have a reason to fight.

352
1485
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:05,474
That's right..

353
1489
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:09,778
I can't take the fact that you are being kicked out of F4 like this.

354
1493
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:13,348
You're not too bright.

355
1497
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,284
Huh?

356
1501
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:18,387
Those things don't matter.

357
1505
00:59:26,527 --> 00:59:28,897
Again, that face.

358
1509
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:47,526
I'm home.

359
1513
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,319
Come in.

360
1517
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:55,090
What's all this?

361
1521
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:58,927
Where were you? 
There are so many things to do right now!

362
1526
00:59:58,927 --> 01:00:00,662
Hurry in and change!

363
1530
01:00:00,662 --> 01:00:01,797
Why so suddenly?

364
1534
01:00:01,797 --> 01:00:07,035
When one thing goes well, everything goes well. 
 It's all thanks to you, my daughter!

365
1539
01:00:07,035 --> 01:00:11,540
There's a rumor that if people get their uniforms cleaned here, that they're going to meet handsome guys.

366
1543
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:19,214
What?
-Look, Korean Girls' School, Han Gang Girls' School, 
Mun Hwa Girls' School, they all come from even across Han Gang!

367
1549
01:00:19,214 --> 01:00:25,320
We're striking it rich, rich! 
I've heard about this before but to experience it myself, this is the first time in my life!

368
1554
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,658
Noona, I heard instead of Joon Pyo hyung, you're going out with a different F4 member, Yoon Ji Hoo.

369
1558
01:00:29,658 --> 01:00:32,394
You! 
Where did you hear that from?

370
1563
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:38,733
It's the Shin Hwa girls who brought their uniforms first.

371
1567
01:00:38,733 --> 01:00:47,943
Goo Joon Pyo or Yoon Ji Hoo, it doesn't matter. Your admittance into Shin Hwa High School is like a dream every day!

372
1571
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:53,929
Honey, I won't wake up from this dream tomorrow, right?
Hold on. *pinches*

373
1576
01:00:53,929 --> 01:00:58,387
Ah, sorry. Honey, I told you everything would work out.

374
1580
01:00:58,387 --> 01:01:04,526
Shin Hwa group aren't the only rich ones
We are the Shin Hwa in the dry cleaning business, we can be rich too!

375
1585
01:01:04,526 --> 01:01:11,033
Rich! Rich! 
Rich! Rich!

376
1590
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:37,192
Speak.

377
1594
01:01:38,293 --> 01:01:41,362
I always took your actions into consideration.

378
1598
01:01:41,362 --> 01:01:49,003
However I would question Joon Pyo's, I didn't think I would have to talk to you like this.

379
1602
01:01:49,003 --> 01:01:51,039
It's unlike you not to get straight to the point.

380
1606
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:54,942
Why did you do it?
I just wanted to.

381
1611
01:01:54,942 --> 01:01:57,212
Joon Pyo likes Jan Di.
 I knew that.

382
1616
01:01:57,212 --> 01:01:59,547
Yoon Ji Hoo!

383
1620
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:04,920
If you had seduced my younger sister and dumped her 3 days later, I wouldn't be this mad.

384
1624
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,988
But, you don't have a younger sister.

385
1628
01:02:06,988 --> 01:02:11,693
This isn't a joke. 
I'm saying to take a friend's girl is

386
1633
01:02:11,693 --> 01:02:15,130
crossing the line.
I feel bad for Joon Pyo too, but . . .

387
1638
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,364
But what?!

388
1642
01:02:16,364 --> 01:02:19,700
I can't let him expel her like that.

389
1646
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,737
So what are you going to do?

390
1650
01:02:23,737 --> 01:02:26,474
I will have to do whatever I can.

391
1654
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:34,615
I'm warning you on this, this time there won't be anyone on your side. 
Don't be disappointed.

392
1659
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,404
I know how you feel Joon Pyo,

393
1663
01:02:56,404 --> 01:02:58,273
but expelling is just too much.

394
1667
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:00,842
Too much?

395
1671
01:03:00,842 --> 01:03:04,279
It'll be too much when I kill them all.

396
1675
01:03:09,885 --> 01:03:12,587
Ji Hoo is not in his right mind right now.

397
1679
01:03:12,587 --> 01:03:22,162
You know what Seo Hyun was to him. 
With his personality, he followed her to Paris. 
An unexpected marriage would definitely make him crazy.

398
1685
01:03:22,162 --> 01:03:32,306
You're right.  It's not because he truly liked Geum Jan Di.  
He used her because of Seo Hyun.

399
1690
01:03:32,306 --> 01:03:36,444
That's even more unforgivable. 
You know that?

400
1695
01:03:41,183 --> 01:03:43,783
Joon Pyo . . .

401
1699
01:03:43,783 --> 01:03:48,256
You can't take his side anymore.

402
1703
01:03:48,256 --> 01:03:50,659
Say one more thing and you'll be kicked out as well..

403
1707
01:04:17,337 --> 01:04:20,007
JH: Let her go.
JP: What will you do if I let her go?

404
1712
01:04:20,007 --> 01:04:21,675
I'll protect her.

405
1716
01:04:21,675 --> 01:04:26,446
You were the friend I watched this movie with 11 times, if you remembered, this wouldn't have happened.

406
1720
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:34,087
You're stupid, how am I suppose to go into the water!

407
1724
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:36,656
Whether they win or lose, it isn't your business.

408
1728
01:04:36,656 --> 01:04:38,792
GE: But for Jan Di
YJ: She'll withdraw from school.

409
1733
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,527
How are the kids?

410
1737
01:04:40,527 --> 01:04:44,431
Don't you know how glad I am that JunPyo has such friends?

411
1741
01:04:44,431 --> 01:04:49,903
The heir of Shin Hwa Group doesn't need friends.

412
1745
01:04:49,903 --> 01:04:53,239
It's not too late.

413
1749
01:04:53,239 --> 01:05:00,147
Just say it once.
Say that you like me.

414
1754
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:03,216
I won't regret it.
