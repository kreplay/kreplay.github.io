Yes.

50
203
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,270
My contract with the production company is going to happen sooner than I thought.

51
207
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,410
So I'll be able to rent my own place.

52
211
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,480
And once I find my own place...

53
215
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,430
And if you find your own place...

54
219
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,480
Then you will no longer have reason to pay rent to me.

55
223
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,140
Yes.

56
227
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,190
And in that case,

57
231
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,810
there won't be a reason to maintain our contract.

58
235
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,390
I had that thought.

59
239
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,990
Since we got married because of rent, after all.

60
243
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,260
That's true.

61
247
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,640
It's a good thing this happened.

62
251
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,890
You can write again,

63
255
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,780
and your financial problems are solved, so it is a very good thing.

64
259
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,130

65
263
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,600

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,360
What you were going to say earlier,

68
275
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,560
you haven't said it yet.

69
279
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,210
It wasn't anything important.

70
283

That our

71
287
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,210
recycling, I would take care of it. That's what I was going to say.

72
291
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,070
When you begin working, I thought you would become busier.

73
295
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:55,190
<i>The wife taking care of these things behind the scenes is important, too.</i>

74

<i>Let's get going.</i>

75
303
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,050
<i>Excuse me, Father.</i>

76
307
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,830
<i>There is something I have to tell you.</i>

77
311
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,850
<i>What is it?</i>

78
315
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,610
I'm sorry, but...

79
319
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,150
<i>This...</i>

80
323
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,290
<i>I cannot accept it.</i>

81
327
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,000
<i>There is something I need to be honest with you about.</i>

82
331
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,880
<i>The reason I married Se Hee</i>

83
335
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,190
<i>was because of his house.</i>

84
339
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,290
<i>From the beginning it was not a marriage based on love.</i>

85
343
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,590
<i>Our conditions were satisfactory to each other,</i>

86
347
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,350
<i>and we had similar values.</i>

87
351
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,670
<i>That is why we married.</i>

88
355
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,940
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

89
359
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,900
<i>So what about it? Why is that a problem?</i>

90
363
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,850
<i>What?</i>

91
367
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,070
<i>What are you sorry for? All marriages are like that.</i>

92
371
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,510
<i>Who marries only because of love? They marry because the conditions are compatible.</i>

93
375
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,340
<i>This is an obvious thing so why are you explaining yourself all of a sudden... ?</i>

94
379
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,460
<i>Father,</i>

95
383
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,790
<i>why did you give us your blessing?</i>

96
387
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,670
<i>It was such a sudden marriage.</i>

97
391
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,630
<i>When it comes to marriage, there is a right time.</i>

98
395
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,550
<i>And you happened to appear at the right time as Se Hee's spouse.</i>

99
399
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,370
<i>And you were pleasant, kind, and well-behaved.</i>

100
403
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,040
<i>There was no reason to object.</i>

101
407
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,820
<i>But then you added that you loved each other, so that was fortunate.</i>

102
411
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,630
<i>So it's fortunate.</i>

103
415
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,560
<i>That it exists in marriage...</i>

104
419
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,340
<i>Love...</i>

105
423
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,170
<i>You're being odd today. What a question.</i>

106
427
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,710
<i>At that time, when you asked me why I was marrying Se Hee,</i>

107
431
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,450
<i>I replied that I loved him.</i>

108
435
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,080
<i>That has been bothering me lately.</i>

109
439
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,510
<i>That I lied to you.</i>

110
443
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
<i>But why, suddenly?</i>

111
447
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,910
<i>Because</i>

112
451
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,040
<i>I came to love Se Hee,</i>

113
455

<i>for real.</i>

114
459
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,080
<i>Well, that is indeed fortunate.</i>

115
463
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,340
<i>And that is how love appears within marriage, you know. As you live together as a couple.</i>

116
467
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:38,600
<i>No matter how much they say the world has changed</i>

117
471
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:45,150
<i>it is still proper for the man's family to pay for the house. And things will get harder when you have to keep house after having babies later. So keep it.</i>

I have a question.

133
535
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,650
Not as someone who signed a contract with you as the payor and payee

134

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,040
and not as a man and a woman,

136

please go ahead.

139

marriage?

141
567
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,900
Do you know

571
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,200
what marriage is, Se Hee?

143

<i>Oh, oh Honey!</i>

144
579

<i>Fine, so are you going to eat that love to survive?</i>

153

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,600
<i>Get out of my house! Never return! Get out!</i>

161
647
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,650
<i>Get out right now!</i>

162
651
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,750
<i>Ji Ho...</i>

163
655
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,850
<i>Marriage must be...</i>

164
659
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,030
<i>So that it...</i>

165
663
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,430
<i>Real marriage...</i>

166
667
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,210
<i>Her voice</i>

167
671
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
<i>is trembling.</i>

168
675
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,710
Marriage that people enter into because of love...

169
679
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,110
<i>Her eyes</i>

170
683
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,200
<i>are tearing up.</i>

171
687
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,040
... is a happy marriage, isn't that right?

172
691
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,900
<i>Ji Ho is</i>

173
695
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,070
<i>... crying.</i>

174
699
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
<i>Because of me. </i>

175
703
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,190
<i>Episode 15
 Because It's My First Intermission</i>

176
708
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,470
Did you sleep well?

177
712
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,080
<i>I'm making a trip home.</i>

178
716
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,440
<i>If there are any requests you'd like to add to our contract termination</i>

179
720
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,740
<i>please let me know.</i>

180
724
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,320
<i>Two Year Tenancy Marriage Contract</i>

181
728
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,570
Ack!

182
732
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,940
Bomi-nim, how are you here?

183
736
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,370
Why else?

184
740
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,230
You don't remember? What happened yesterday?

185
744
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,140
What happened yesterday? What . . .  oh, what's this, boxers.

186
748
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,480
Why am I in my underwear?

187
752
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,180
Why are you acting like you're embarrassed?

188
756
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,630
Yesterday, you were stripping your clothes off just fine.

189
760
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,530
You really don't remember, it seems. What happened last night.

190
764
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,150
I've got a sour tummy.

191
768
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,200
Is there something to help me sober up?

192
772
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,130
Why are you hugging this pillow though?

193
776
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,770
Who are you to take someone else's pillow and sleep with it?

194
780
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,520
Do you know what this pillow is? Why are you just taking it carelessly without asking first --

195
784
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,540
Obnoxious.

196
788
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,600
You almost died at the club and I carried you home on my back.

197
792
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,080
What? Carelessly?

198
796
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,840
You took off your own clothes while you were sleeping.

199
800
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,230
Bomi-nim.

200
804
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,940
I'm sorry. I really misunderstood.

201
808
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,840
It's because I'm quite a loser at the moment.

202
812
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,900
I was mad at myself but I took it out on you instead.

203
816
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,980
I'm really sorry.

204
820
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,850
You don't want to get sobered up?

205
824
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,160
Ho Rang, you eat this stuff well too?

206
828
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,710
Yes. I have to eat hangover soup here the day after I drink alcohol to feel sobered up.

207
832
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,860
You are truly my ideal type.

208
836
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,670
What?

209
840
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,100
Deputy Sim.

210
844
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,220
Oh, Bomi, you're here to eat?

211
848
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,820
Yes.

212
852
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,950
Come sit over here.

213
856
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,680
That's regrettable. Thanks to you we got some new regulars.

214
860
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,020
It's regrettable for me as well.

215
864
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,480
Thank you so much

216
868
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,910
for giving me a great job.

217
872
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,830
It's not much.

218
876
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,970
Think of it as retirement pension and congratulatory gift.

219
880
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,590
But where's Bok Nam?

220
884
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,360
Bok Nam? Bok Nam --

221
888
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,350
Where did that kid go again?

222
892
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,640
Ack!

223
896
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,370
Oh, you startled me!

224
900
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,680
What?

225
904
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,220
I ran here thinking I missed the chance to say bye to you.

226
908
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,520
So startled. Why did you run here?

227
912
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,890
Where's your motorcycle?

228
916
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,250
I parted ways with it after a teary farewell ceremony.

229
920
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,110
I put it up for sale, so I can go study at the academy.

230
924
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:31,220
Academy? Oh, that one you talked about before? So you could immigrate as a skilled worker?

231
928
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,490
I think I will croak if I continue to live my lifestyle.

232
932
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,390
What is this? A frame?

233
936
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,760
You don't remember? The wedding picture I directed for you two.

234
940
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,290
Oh.

235
944
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,890
I went to the ceremony hall for part-time work and I got it. You're grateful, right?

236
948
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,950
Thank you, Bok Nam.

237
952
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,520
We've decided to divorce.

238
956
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,430
What?

239
960
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,150
Our marriage. We've decided to end it.

240
964
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,250
What are you talking about?

241
968
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,630
You guys fought? Did you fight?

242
972
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,690
No.

243
976
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,940
It seems it will be hard to live together due to personality differences.

244
980
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,330
So we mutually agreed to end it.

245
984
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,700
What are you talking about?

246
988
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,910
If you disagree, you just try to adjust to each other. That's what married life is.

247
992
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,640
What is this?!

248
996
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,430
Honey. Say something to him.

249
1000
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,710
Ji Ho's friend. How do you and the accountant know each other?

250
1004
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,080
Well, that's . . .

251
1008
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,230
We met on the app. On Gyeolmalrae.

252
1012
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,230
Our app? Heol!

253
1016
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,000
You kept asking me for points. So it was because of her.

254
1020
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,410
This is all thanks to you, Bomi, and Won Seok.

255
1024
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,900
Thanks to such capable developers,

256
1028
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,600
I got to meet my ideal woman. I thought I wouldn't be able to, not in this life.

257
1032
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,030
Your ideal type?

258
1036
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,960
Yes, my wish was to marry someone like Ho Rang.

259
1040
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,710
Positive and meticulous and easy-going.

260
1044
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,920
I was totally shocked when I first met her. There's nothing I dislike about her, at all.

261
1048
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,050
So you're getting married?

262
1052
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,630
Did you two set a date yet?

263
1056
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,530
No. It's not like that.

264
1060
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,580
It's true. It's not like that.

265
1064
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,220
We just in the 'some' (flirting) phase.

266
1068
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,020
But this is something I must put in all my 'best touch' towards the done proposal.

267
1072
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,860
Until Sam Okyere is so shocked he says 'h' (celebrity reference). Agree (said with an aspirated 'h' sound)?

268
1076
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,870
Agree back.

269
1080
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,600
Oh. Alright.

270
1084
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,260
It's going to get cold. Hurry and eat.

271
1088
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,990
He's still using teen slang.

272
1092
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,480
- Totally ruins it.
 - Teen slang?

273
1097
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,390
Did he study abroad?

274
1101
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,980
Ho Rang!

275
1105
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,300
- You need to put this in to make it taste good. Put lots of --
- No, perilla . . .

276
1110
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,760
No, Rang doesn't like perilla seeds.

277
1114
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,370
I'm sorry.

278
1118
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:59,990
It's me. If it's alright, would you like to go on a date with me?

279
1122
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,710
So you're going to part ways?

280
1126
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,330
Yes.

281
1130
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,260
Alright. Since you always live life just as you please.

282
1134
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,040
Getting married as you please, and divorce as you please, too.

283
1138
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,960
Do you really think that way?

284
1142
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,670
That I've been living life as I please?

285
1146
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,600
Do you really think that?

286
1150
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,700
What is this then, if it's not living as you please?

287
1154
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,440
Father.

288
1158
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:55,000
Father, as for me, after that day,

289
1162
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,730
I have not once, even for a second, lived as I pleased.

290
1166
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,060
Do you know why?

291
1170
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,090
Because the person I chose for the first time since I was born,

292
1174
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,360
was rejected.

293
1178
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,340
And by the person I trusted the most...

294
1182
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,650
the person I loved the most.

295
1186
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,560
I liked you so much, Father.

296
1190
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,890
I loved you so much.

297
1194
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,500
But that person I loved

298
1198
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,190
disregarded wholly the life that I chose.

299
1202
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:42,660
Do you know how that had wounded my heart?

300
1206
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,570
But what about you, then?

301
1210
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,810
Do you know with what mindset I've lived my life, since then?

302
1214
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,930
Even if I go back to that time, my choice is the same.

303
1218
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,630
What parent, when their child says he will go into a fire pit,

304
1222
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,800
just sits and watches? If you had married her, back then,

305
1226
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,340
think about just how miserable your life would be now.

306
1230
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,060
So in order to save your own child,

307
1234
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,640
you push another's child into that fire pit?

308
1238
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,930
Because she's a woman, because she was poor.

309
1242
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,130
So you left her to carry all the baggage on her own?

310
1246
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,700
Because my own child is more important to me.

311
1250
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,900
Even if it's childish and loathesome, that is the heart of a parent.

312
1254
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,940
That is love.

313
1258
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:42,450
So... so... how could I let anyone be with me?

314
1262
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,860
How do I have the right?

315
1266
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,590
When I should just be miserable alone.

316
1270
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:38,890
Wow. CEO. I really thought you were some bat.

317
1274
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,720
Thank you, Writer. Using that expression.

318
1278
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,860
So you really won't sign with us?

319
1282
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:08,080
Because of Se Hee? Because you don't want to be involved with me?

320
1286
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,150
If I said it's not, then it would be a lie, right?

321
1290
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,370
I am divorcing.

322
1294
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,060
What?

323
1298
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,680
To be more precise,

324
1302
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,490
our contract, we've decided to end it.

325
1306
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,310
What?

326
1310
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,300
Because it feels like it's because of you?

327
1314
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,150
Yes.

328
1318
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:56,280
You don't have quite that much influence in our relationship.

329
1322
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,300
I see.

330
1326
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,720
I went overboard, then.

331
1330
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,210
I could see things more clearly, actually. Thanks to you.

332
1334
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,550
That I truly

333
1338
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,620
love Se Hee.

334
1342
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,710
I came to know that more clearly.

335
1346
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,540
But . . . why . . .

336
1350
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,730
I want to love.

337
1354
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,960
I want to love to my heart's content, with him.

338
1358
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,940
But I don't know how to do that.

339
1362
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,670
Just...

340
1366
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,900
<i>What about kids then? When will you have a kid then? </i>

341
1370
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,380
<i>That's what all marriages are like.</i>

342
1374
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,690
<i>Who only gets married for love?</i>

343
1378
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,710
<i>The conditions have to be suitable.</i>

344
1382
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,840
It feels like being holed up in Room #19 called marriage, should I say?

345
1386
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,450
It's a bit strange, right? And complicated.

346
1390
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,700
No.

347
1394
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,880
To be honest, I can understand you so well.

348
1398
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,660
Marriage is too many people's

349
1402
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,000
love getting tangled up, it seems.

350
1406
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,750
<i>The issue is that those loves,</i>

351
1410
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,140
<i>each and all</i>

352
1414
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:00,460
<i>are all sincere.</i>

353
1418
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,450
<i>When you get to know it, each and all</i>

354
1422
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,270
<i>have such beautiful hearts.</i>

355
1426
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,220
But even the beautiful hearts, when you tangle them up and mix them,

356
1430
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:21,370
the original beautiful image it once was

357
1434
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,140
becomes unidentifiable.

358
1438
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,470
What kind of a love was it, originally?

359
1442
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,080
That becomes unknowable.

360
1446
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:44,240
That's why they say husband and wife stay together for attachment. They are zero degree kins. They are family.

361
1450
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,310
I suppose they become all of those various relationships.

362
1454
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,720
It's very amazing

363
1458
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,580
and a very scary thing, I think. Becoming spouses.

364
1462
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,780
But I had still wished that you and Se Hee

365
1466
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,010
would have a happy ending.

366
1470
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,140
Why do you think we have

367
1474
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,380
a sad ending?

368
1478
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,450
What?

369
1482
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,140
Because we're divorcing?

370
1486
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,070
Oh...

371
1490
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,110
That's --

372
1494
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:38,460
You can't believe maintaining a marriage equals happy ending.

373
1498
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,150
And divorce is a failure of that happiness?

374
1502
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,900
The production company CEO who is spearheading 21st century media contents --

375
1506
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:55,090
The person who said she was looking forward to a project that exceeds even the experimental, from me.

376
1510
00:31:55,090 --> 00:32:01,770
That person couldn't be someone with such an old-fashioned mindset, right?

377
1514
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,440
I am not, of course.

378
1518
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,060
Definitely not.

379
1522
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,320
Definitely not, Writer.

380
1526
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,130
We are definitely not that kind of a production company.

381
1530
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,340
Signing the contract --

382
1534
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,460
I really should reconsider it.

383
1538
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,270
Did she just f*ck with me?

384
1542
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,440
Who is it, at this hour?

385
1546
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,360
What are you doing here, without telling me?

386
1550
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,230
What else? I came because I missed Mom, of course!

387
1554
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,050
Wow, this tastes so bad.

388
1558
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,570
Jjajjang noodle tastes the best when I eat with my Soo Ji.

389
1562
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,180
But on a golden Sunday, I am here

390
1566
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,760
eating this cozily with you so I really feel like

391
1570
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,790
I will puke.

392
1574
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,730
But she should tell me if she arrived,

393
1578
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,150
or whatever. I mean, why won't she write back?

394
1582
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,680
Hey.

395
1586
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,840
This isn't the kind of liquor you drink like that. At that rate, your liver will melt.

396
1590
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,990
Then what about you? Have you been living life without a liver since college days?

397
1594
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,710
I've been living life while laundering my liver, of course.

398
1598
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,140
Here, give it. Stop drinking it.

399
1602
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,360
You're not someone who even drinks alcohol. What's with you, suddenly?

400
1606
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,250
Did you confess?

401
1610
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,590
You said you were going to confess to Ji Ho.

402
1614
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,330
You were going to choose one out of the three.

403
1618
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,990
<i>CEO Ma, when you're confessing, which sentence is the least cheesy?</i>

404
1622
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:21,120
First, now, should we really marry for real?

405
1626
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,050
Second, should we be a real husband and wife now?

406
1630
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,280
Third, should we really be together now?

407
1634
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,940
Hey, you prepared three so earnestly, unlike your usual self.

408
1638
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,870
So which did you go with, among the three?

409
1642
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,260
All three . . . .

410
1646
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,180
I couldn't do it.

411
1650
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,690
You said all three were cheesy.

412
1654
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,650
You couldn't, or you didn't?

413
1658
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,810
So you didn't do it.

414
1662
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,600
<i>Sleep well warmly.</i>

415
1666
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,610
<i>And I love you.</i>

416
1670
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,880
What are you looking at?

417
1674
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,950
How do you like him? He's totally my style.

418
1678
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,580
Who?

419
1682
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,420
The foreigner?

420
1686
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,810
Why is he so white?

421
1690
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,020
Not my style.

422
1694
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,390
Your oppa isn't my style either.

423
1698
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,750
By looks.

424
1702
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,480
How is your leg so tense?

425
1706
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,850
Hey, Woo Soo.

426
1710
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,730
Why do you hide your oppa from me?

427
1714
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,090
I didn't hide anything.

428
1718
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,920
It's just that there isn't much to say.

429
1722
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,620
So how come there's nothing to say?

430
1726
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,720
The day your oppa came,

431
1730
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,070
I felt really betrayed by you.

432
1734
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,570
Do you know that?

433
1738
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,860
Betrayed? You did?

434
1742
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,770
Yea! I thought you were "mo-sol." (single since birth)

435
1746
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,920
Since you never talk about men.

436
1750
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,010
That's why I felt betrayed.

437
1754
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,400
I worried so much that my daughter was cursed, since you never dated for 30 years.

438
1758
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,850
So I felt cheated for worrying about you daily.

439
1762
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,420
Where did you learn to use those words?

440
1766
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:46,220
You -- you and your boyfriend. Why are you making us compete?

441
1770
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,170
What?

442
1774
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,160
You are.

443
1778
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,920
If Mom says she felt betrayed,

444
1782
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,600
you should be mad and saying, 'why would you feel betrayed'?

445
1786
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,020
But instead, saying "you did?" and

446
1790
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,480
why are you putting on that guilty look?

447
1794
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,530
Do you feel guilty towards me?

448
1798
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,350
Because my leg is a guilt to you?

449
1802
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:23,090
No. What are you talking about?

450
1806
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,930
Then why?

451
1810
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,500
How come I feel like my leg is holding you back?

452
1814
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,300
I said it's not!

453
1818
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,980
Why do you keep on saying strange stuff?

454
1822
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,790
Then why aren't you leaving the company?

455
1826
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,530
When you have to take medicine all the time from the stress.

456
1830
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,290
Last time you even had a hair loss spot from stress.

457
1834
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,500
How can I quit the company when there's so much stuff I need to pay for?

458
1838
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,500
Yea, I'm glad you brought that up.

459
1842
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,990
Your money. Are you spending your money on yourself?

460
1846
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,260
You're shooting it all towards the apartment parcel.

461
1850
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,090
That's for you and me to live together later on!

462
1854
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,420
I'm not going to live there though!

463
1858
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,700
Then?

464
1862
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,460
How are you going to live alone with that leg?

465
1866
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,950
See?

466
1870
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,540
My leg is the obstacle to you.

467
1874
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,290
I told you to stand on my leg to take on the world, instead,

468
1878
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:33,880
my leg, you've been carrying it all alone.

469
1882
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,930
And pinned yourself under it.

470
1886
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,970
<i>#1. Should we really marry now?</i>

471
1890
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,430
<i>#2. Should we be real husband and wife now?</i>

472
1894
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:12,340
<i>#3. Should we really be together now?</i>

473
1898
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,920
<i>I need your help, Soo Ji!</i>

474
1902
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,400
<i>What is the least cheesy line for proposing?</i>

475
1906
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,460
<i>I'm asking because my friend's friend's friend is confessing and asked my opinion.</i>

476
1910
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,980
Excuse me, Mrs. Writer. Would you look at these and tell me what line is the least cheesy?

477
1914
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,460
I'm not sure. I think they're all about the same.

478
1918
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,700
Still, you should choose one.

479
1922
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,420
Since you're going to be the person who will get proposed to.

480
1926
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,530
What?

481
1930
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:51,340
Who could CEO Ma's friend's friend's friend be?

482
1934
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,420
Your husband.

483
1938
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,330
Ah...

484
1942
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,210
Are you not happy?

485
1946
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,980
What?

486
1950
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,470
<i>Why was I not happy?</i>

487
1954
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,720
<i>At times, they were the words I waited for,</i>

488
1958
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,280
<i>At times, they were the words I wanted to hear...</i>

489
1962
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,480
<i>but why was I</i>

490
1966
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,790
<i>scared?</i>

491
1970
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,070
<i>Hey! Come to your senses, Nam Se Hee! We're almost to your house.</i>

492
1974
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,260
- Let's go.
- Let's go in.

493
1979
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,730
<i>- Let's go.
- Hey, we are in front of your place. Come to your senses. Let's go in.</i>

494
1984
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,620
Hey! Hey! Come to your senses!

495
1988
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,820
- Hey!
- Let's go. What's wrong with you?

496
1993
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,760
Oh, Ji Ho..

497
1997
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,890
Ji Ho?!!

498
2001
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,100
Oh my, Se Hee!

499
2005
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,720
- Let's go to your house, Ji Ho. 
- Yeah.

500
2010
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,510
Hey! Hey! Come to your senses!

501
2014
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,360
We arrived at home now. Hey, put in your pass code.

502
2018
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,110
Put your pass code in properly.

503
2022
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,860
Aigoo, seriously...

504
2026
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,250
Let's go in.

505
2030
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,900
Aigoo. We're here.

506
2034
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,340
Hey! Take off your shoes!

507
2038
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,270
Ah, leave it!

508
2042
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:18,470
- Don't speak.
- I am a person who am capable of taking of my own shoes.

509
2047
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,500
Aigoo, put some strength in your body!

510
2051
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,510
Are you a squid or what?

511
2055
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,580
Get up! Go in.

512
2059
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,030
- I'll be getting off here, sir.
- Where's his room, Ji Ho?

513
2064
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,300
- Ji Ho?!!
- Ah, just go on in!

514
2069
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,970
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

515
2073
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:37,090
What do you mean?! This is your home. Lay down!

516
2077
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,260
Please come to your senses. Go to sleep now.

517
2081
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,390
- Aigoo.. give him some blanket.
- Yes.

518
2086
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,990
Aigoo...why did you drink so much?

519
2090
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,020
Did he drink a lot?

520
2094
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,990
He drank the entire bottle of second head liquor.

521
2098
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,010
Second head liquor (50% alcohol by content).

522
2102
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,220
That liquor can get you drunk just by smelling it.

523
2106
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:10,090
I know, right? Like some sparrow, he just kept gulping it down his throat.

524
2110
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,930
Wow, when he drink it like that, how can a person not—

525
2114
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,960
Aigoo, that scared me!!

526
2118
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,370
Are you sleeping?!

527
2122
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,370
What are you doing now?

528
2126
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,320
Nam Se Hee? Are you okay?

529
2130
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,590
Wow, you're really amazing.

530
2134
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,660
In his complete drunk state, he still has his sanity together.

531
2138
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,740
This is indeed an amazing and weird man. That's what I think.

532
2142
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,360
I know, right?

533
2146
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,170
By any chance, are you dead?

534
2150
00:42:53,990 --> 00:43:00,790
One should drink liquor to a proper extent. Second head liquor is over 40% alcohol by content. It burns you in the throat.

535
2154
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,400
Ah, yes. Thank you.

536
2158
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,440
Honestly, Se Hee

537
2162
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,500
was going to confess to you.

538
2166
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,660
Yes...I know.

539
2170
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:29,930
Ah...so you heard from my baby-, I mean Soo Ji.

540
2174
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,050
Yes.

541
2178
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:36,450
I see, Soo Ji is your baby...

542
2182
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,770
He probably was too shy to tell you.

543
2186
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:46,250
He's someone who's never said those words with his own mouth.

544
2190
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:51,490
It's not that he didn't say it?

545
2194
00:43:54,770 --> 00:44:00,340
Have you ever seen Se Hee getting angry?

546
2198
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,950
Of course, I have.

547
2202
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,970
At times, I can tell he's spitting at me with his eyes.

548
2206
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:09,330
He really hates anything that disrupts him while working.

549
2210
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,090
Then, do you know what he's afraid of?

550
2214
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:20,280
Ah, for him... besides cats, he's scared of all animals.

551
2218
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:28,750
Then... you must've seen him cry before.

552
2222
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,450
Ah...about that...

553
2226
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,400
Yes, honestly, I have seen that, too.

554
2230
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,300
I'm jealous of you.

555
2234
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,070
I've never seen that before.

556
2238
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,460
Se Hee's Room #19.

557
2242
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,840
But... Room #19?

558
2246
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:53,920
I need to see that, in order to know what I should do.

559
2250
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,180
However, whatever is in there,

560
2254
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,330
perhaps he himself doesn't know it.

561
2258
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,050
Or...

562
2262
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:13,920
maybe he doesn't know how to open that door. If not, then...

563
2266
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:19,490
he might be afraid to let me see it.

564
2270
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,270
I'm probably saying some weird things right now, correct?

565
2274
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,030
No. I understood everything.

566
2278
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,060
Really?

567
2282
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,430
Of course. That "Room 19."

568
2286
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,930
The fact that he named his (porn) folder, "Room 19."
[T/N: X-rated material are called "Forbidden 19" in Korean]

569
2291
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,050
That is very unique and brave of him.

570
2295
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:43,830
What? Folder?

571
2299
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:48,390
Don't worry. So that he stops watching such videos,

572
2303
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:51,550
I will properly scold him.

573
2307
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,620
Ah, this is embarrassing...

574
2311
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,480
Ah, that punk should've been careful with those things.

575
2315
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,700
He's an adult already. Ah, if he keeps it in the external hard drive. No.

576
2319
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,310
Having it on an external hard drive is easier to carry around, though.

577
2323
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,740
That's not what I'm talking about...

578
2327
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,160
There is no need to deny. Ah, I'm sorry.

579
2331
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,180
Ji Ho.

580
2335
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,290
That's hot.

581
2339
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:18,300
The cup of tea is pretty hot.

582
2343
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,970
<i>Ah...seriously, that's amazing.</i>

583
2347
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:27,920
Ah, if your friend didn't tell me you like perilla seed powder, I would've never known.

584
2351
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,200
I will make sure to use all my power to remember this.

585
2355
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,630
Perilla. Seed. Powder.

586
2359
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,430
Are you cold, Ho Rang?

587
2363
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,930
Ah..no. I'm fine.

588
2367
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:51,430
You don't seem fine. You've been curling up your toes since earlier.

589
2371
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:56,180
I turned on the butt warmer, so you should warm up soon.

590
2375
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,460
<i>Seok!</i>

591
2379
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,270
<i>- Did you waited long?
- No, it wasn't long.</i>

592
2384
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,610
<i>- Let's hurry up and go.
- No. Sit down first.</i>

593
2389
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,290
<i>Let's change this and then leave.</i>

594
2393
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,630
<i>You brought that with you?</i>

595
2397
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:17,830
<i>Of course I brought it, your hands and feet are always cold.</i>

596
2401
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,430
<i>Give it to me.</i>

597
2405
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,020
<i>Let's hurry and wear these before your feet freeze.</i>

598
2409
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,990
<i>I also brought you sneakers.</i>

599
2413
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,630
What do you think about it, Ho Rang?

600
2417
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,860
- What?
- My car.

601
2422
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,330
Don't you think it's best to change it to a SUV?

602
2426
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:40,460
Once I get a bigger family, I think that would be nice.

603
2430
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,380
Also, especially for raising babies.

604
2434
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:52,930
Ah...I must've made you uncomfortable again.

605
2438
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,850
I'm sorry. What's wrong with me today?

606
2442
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:02,190
I don't have a girlfriend right now because I keep going too fast. I'm sorry, Ho Rang.

607
2446
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,330
<i>When I saw her, I was so surprised. There was nothing about her that I didn't like.</i>

608
2450
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:30,440
<i>She's positive, meticulous, and easy going.</i>

609
2454
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,600
<i>Rang.. What's wrong?</i>

610
2458
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,500
<i>Are you crying?</i>

611
2462
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,060
<i>No..did I do something wrong?</i>

612
2466
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,390
<i>You turned away first.</i>

613
2470
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,200
<i>What do you mean?</i>

614
2474
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:05,130
<i>When I was leaving just now and waving goodbye...</i>

615
2478
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:08,520
<i>you didn't even turned back and just left.</i>

616
2482
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,830
<i>You can't do that even when you're dating?</i>

617
2486
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,640
<i>It's not that you can't,</i>

618
2490
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,430
<i>it just makes me sad.</i>

619
2494
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:21,720
<i>I don't want to be like this either, but the more I start to like you,</i>

620
2498
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,990
<i>I don't know why there are more things that makes me sad.</i>

621
2502
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:28,900
<i>I got it. I'm really sorry. I won't do it again.</i>

622
2506
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,420
<i>So, don't cry anymore, Rang. You'll catch a cold.</i>

623
2510
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,160
<i>Tears, stop flowing.</i>

624
2514
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:41,930
Easy going, my ass.. Do you know how easy it is to make her mad?

625
2518
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,420
Ah, this punk should've been more careful.

626
2522
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,280
Why does he like watching those type of movies so much?

627
2526
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,440
What is my baby doing?

628
2530
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:58,530
What is it again?

629
2534
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:03,570
<i>What message is the most natural to send at this time, Hyung?</i>

630
2538
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:08,370
Asleep? Are you asleep? Are you sleeping?

631
2542
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,800
"Are you sleeping"? What the heck is this?

632
2546
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,830
Ah, this punk still has a lot of learn from me.

633
2550
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:20,300
What's wrong with that guy and this guy?

634
2554
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,490
Maybe the property where the company is isn't good (luck)?

635
2558
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,040
Hey, I need to something about it.

636
2562
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,800
<i>Don't do it. Just sleep.</i>

637
2566
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,870
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

638
2570
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,900
He read it.

639
2574
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,530
He read it..What should I do?

640
2578
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:03,530
I shouldn't have sent it at all...

641
2582
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,730
<i>Won Seok</i>

642
2586
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,470
Hello?

643
2590
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:24,690
Yeah, it's me.

644
2594
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:29,150
<i>Yeah...</i> I didn't wake you up, right?

645
2598
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,800
Since this is around the time you go to bed.

646
2602
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,110
No, I haven't gone to bed yet.

647
2606
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:38,600
<i>I see...it's a relief.</i>

648
2610
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:44,800
Is it manageable to stay with Soo Ji? She tends to grind her teeth a lot in her sleep.

649
2614
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,040
She wears a mouthpiece, so it's alright.

650
2618
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,330
That person seemed like a good guy.

651
2622
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,580
Umm

652
2626
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,400
It seems that way.

653
2630
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,580
I'm still getting to know him.

654
2634
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,870
The same with  my heart

655
2638
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,590
Like you said

656
2642
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:21,420
it's possible that there are some things in my heart that I wasn't aware of.

657
2646
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,780
Yeah you did well. That's possible.

658
2650
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,430
That person of yours seems very cool too.

659
2654
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,570
And honest.

660
2658
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,580
Yeah it seems so.

661
2662
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,500
Seok

662
2666
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,630
Hmmm

663
2670
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:45,150
I've given it some thought

664
2674
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,960
and my entire 20's.

665
2678
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,250
A quarter of my life was spent with you.

666
2682
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,410
I'm sorry

667
2686
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:01,190
That I couldn't take responsibility for those time we spent together.

668
2690
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:06,050
No that's not what I'm saying.

669
2694
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:09,290
I didn't say that to get an apology.

670
2698
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,820
What I'm saying is

671
2702
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,430
Is

672
2706
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,360
That is was fortunate.

673
2710
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,470
The best time of my life

674
2714
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:31,930
were spent with you.

675
2718
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:37,850
So...

676
2722
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:43,280
If you're having a tough time and need some help, call me.

677
2726
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,460
We were lovers but

678
2730
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,650
We've also been friends for a long time.

679
2734
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,100
I called you too late

680
2738
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,950
You must be tired, Go to sleep. I'll hang up now.

681
2742
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,400
Ho Rang

682
2746
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,190
Uh?

683
2750
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,560
Be happy.

684
2754
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,820
You must!

685
2758
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,570
Okay?

686
2762
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:21,100
<i>It was a beautiful heart.</i>

687
2766
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:41,050
Soo Ji

688
2770
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,780
You really don't know

689
2774
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,950
your mom's heart, you rascal?

690
2778
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,590
You have to happy

691
2782
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,370
So that I can be happy too.

692
2786
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,760
My daughter who has the kindest heart in the world.

693
2790
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:16,280
Now, go fly up and up.

694
2794
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,150
Fly for mom's share too.

695
2798
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:33,560
<i>In the end, it was all to wish for your happiness.</i>

696
2802
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,980
<i>Those beautiful hearts.</i>

697
2806
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,990
<i>Ho Rang I am sorry about today<i></i></i>

698
2810
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,420
<i>I'll come closer to you more slowly. </i>

699
2814
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,180
<i></i><i>Good night</i>

700
2818
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,190
<i>The hearts that have passed too. </i>

701
2822
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,560
<i>The new hearts too. </i>

702
2826
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:05,410
<i>Someone's clumsy heart too.</i>

703
2830
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:10,410
<i>And also, this aching heart as well. </i>

704
2834
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,810
<i>In the end, it's all </i>

705
2838
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:24,400
<i>hearts that wish for you to be happy. </i>

706
2842
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:36,990
<i>Those beautiful hearts. All of them. </i>

707
2846
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:45,080
<i>Could they be all safeguarded as they are, by me?</i>

708
2850
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:52,260
♫ <i>Please just stay as is quietly</i> ♫

709
2854
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,860
♫ <i>As though we are together by coincidence</i> ♫

710
2858
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,780
Yup, Mom. What happened, at this late night?

711
2862
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:10,510
Really?

712
2866
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:41,600
<i>Please don't drink cold water.</i>

713
2870
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:46,120
<i>The soup in the pot. Warm it first.</i>

714
2874
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,830
<i>Go Jeong Min</i>

715
2878
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,220
Hello?

716
2882
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:30,360
Did you guys fight?

717
2886
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,380
You fought?

718
2890
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,560
Se Hee did something wrong?

719
2894
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,490
No.

720
2898
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:40,990
It's not like that.

721
2902
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:45,060
Yea, it's due to personality differences, right?

722
2906
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:52,350
Se Hee is very taciturn, right? And hard to read.

723
2910
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,220
Right?

724
2914
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,720
So it's very upsetting, right?

725
2918
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,310
Yes.

726
2922
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,930
It's true.

727
2926
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:07,130
There are times when I don't know what he's thinking.

728
2930
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,460
Yea. It would be so.

729
2934
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,100
Husbands are all like that.

730
2938
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,730
Even when they are old, they are kids.

731
2942
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:21,560
So the woman need to coax them and pacify them, or else it's tough.

732
2946
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,570
No.

733
2950
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,560
Not that.

734
2954
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,130
Huh?

735
2958
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,960
Marriage is between an adult and another adult.

736
2962
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,960
Se Hee is already a very accomplished adult.

737
2966
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,970
Just that . . .

738
2970
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,300
He's an adult with rather lots of wounds.

739
2974
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:53,770
Father-in-law said something similar to what you said too.

740
2978
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:59,920
He said it's important for the wife to play the middle role well.

741
2982
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,890
I had thought so at first as well.

742
2986
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:11,020
Since Se Hee was my landlord.

743
2990
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,180
The reason for me to live in that house

744
2994
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:19,530
included me carrying out some tasks.

745
2998
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,860
So I had thought it was right to do so.

746
3002
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,660
But --

747
3006
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:32,120
As my love grew deeper, my disarray became bigger.

748
3010
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:37,290
How much longer could I continue with this disarray?

749
3014
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:40,390
Distribute labor with labor.

750
3018
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:47,580
Pay back memorial ceremony with kimchi making.

751
3022
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:51,150
Whether making up for this disarray is the right thing.

752
3026
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:54,850
What are you talking about?

753
3030
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:57,420
Kimchi making?

754
3034
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:01,770
Can't be. Se Hee went to make kimchi?

755
3038
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:03,620
Mother-in-law.

756
3042
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:12,760
I do not wish to live a married life coaxing and pacifying Se Hee.

757
3046
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:18,720
I do not wish to play the middle role for you and Father-in-law.

758
3050
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:27,770
Se Hee's wounds that haven't healed. I do not wish to remain as the role of a cushion.

759
3054
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:37,220
You've given Se Hee wounds once.

760
3058
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,280
You too. Father too.

761
3062
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:46,930
How long ago was that though!

762
3066
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:53,300
No matter how long ago it was, it happened.

763
3070
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,840
And there are people who got hurt by it.

764
3074
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,310
And also --

765
3078
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:05,320
It is something that can happen again through a different method as well.

766
3082
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,180
Today --

767
3086
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:14,320
We should've had a meal together instead, maybe.

768
3090
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,610
You and I never once ate a meal together alone, it seems.

769
3094
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:23,790
Other than during the memorial ceremony and the formal meeting of the families.

770
3098
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:26,890
Hey. You're seriously . . .

771
3102
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:32,770
I mean, I know kids these days do as they please.

772
3106
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:36,120
But how can you guys just quit a marriage like that to your liking?

773
3110
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,930
Marriage isn't a joke.

774
3114
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:41,590
Marriage is something sacred.

775
3118
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:44,290
I'm very sorry, Mother-in-law.

776
3122
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,060
But as for me --

777
3126
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:54,890
I do not regard marriage as something sacred.

778
3130
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:57,750
It's love

779
3134
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,010
that is sacred.

780
3138
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,790
I'm sorry.

781
3142
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,770
You should know.

782
3146
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,940
I thought.

783
3150
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:04,450
So she knew everything already?

784
3154
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,900
Yea.

785
3158
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:15,190
The two of had rice liquor together and that's what happened.

786
3162
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:17,760
I see.

787
3166
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,560
So she knew about everything.

788
3170
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:30,550
The two of you are close, it seems.

789
3174
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:36,200
A bit, it seems.

790
3178
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:40,740
A bit strange, is it?

791
3182
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,030
The two of being close?

792
3186
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:47,840
Well, it doesn't seem ordinary.

793
3190
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,400
Yea.

794
3194
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,210
I thought so too at first.

795
3198
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:55,610
But Writer said this.

796
3202
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:59,100
Why can't we, exactly?

797
3206
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:04,560
But then it seems like she's messing with me too somehow.

798
3210
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:09,820
She's a bit of a psycho, Writer-nim is.

799
3214
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:15,760
In a good way.

800
3218
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:22,440
She has that unexpected side to her, Ji Ho.

801
3222
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:31,290
Se Hee.

802
3226
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:38,390
That my words would go into your heart

803
3230
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:42,120
and remain in there, like a last will and testament, I had no idea.

804
3234
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,840
I'm sorry.

805
3238
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:55,030
That time... I was having a hard time with my feelings alone...

806
3242
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:59,280
You don't have to say it.

807
3246
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:04,040
It was no one's fault.

808
3250
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,810
That time...

809
3254
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,940
It just happened that way.

810
3258
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,220
Be happy.

811
3262
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:31,190
Be happy, Se Hee.

812
3266
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,480
What about your family?

813
3270
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,530
I should go and see them...

814
3274
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,290
I already told them yesterday.

815
3278
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:20,360
My mom and dad came up to Seoul, briefly, yesterday.

816
3282
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:26,430
So they came up here, Mother and Father.

817
3286
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:31,290
If you told me, I would have gone with you.

818
3290
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:34,610
No, it's okay.

819
3294
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:37,210
I told them well.

820
3298
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:43,730
Did you get your own place?

821
3302
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:54,110
First, I will go travelling.

822
3306
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:57,840
I have never traveled alone

823
3310
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,230
I realized.

824
3314
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:02,380
That's right.

825
3318
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,620
You were very busy.

826
3322
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:10,770
I am very happy for you.

827
3326
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:13,610
That you have found the road that you were looking for.

828
3330
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,150
Is that so?

829
3334
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:19,620
Yes.

830
3338
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:23,690
You found what you wanted to do.

831
3342
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:26,590
And you are able to do the things you weren't able to, before.

832
3346
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:32,600
Because you have found the road that makes you happy,

833
3350
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,410
so I am happy for you.

834
3354
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,250
Then what about you?

835
3358
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:40,880
Yes?

836
3362
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,990
Se Hee...

837
3366
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,280
how will you live now?

838
3370
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:50,920
Well... do you have any plans?

839
3374
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,850
For me... it will be the same.

840
3378
01:08:56,850 --> 01:09:00,470
Going to work, getting off work, watching soccer

841
3382
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:03,480
and being with kitty, just like that.

842
3386
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:08,160
Just like you were, peacefully.

843
3390
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,700
Yes.

844
3394
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:16,430
Are you going to get a new tenant?

845
3398
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,100
Well...

846
3402
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,380
perhaps.

847
3406
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:34,980
Then, should we destroy this?

848
3410
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:38,540
Contracts are usually destroyed to avoid leaving any loose ends.

849
3414
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,770
Yes, if you want to.

850
3418
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:43,830
Yes.

851
3422
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:52,090
♫ <i>those dreams that filled this room</i> ♫

852
3426
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:56,280
♫ <i>have lost their meaning, one sheet at a time</i> ♫

853
3430
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,040
Our contract,

854
3434
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,820
it's really come to an end, like this.

855
3438
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,570
Do you have...

856
3442
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:14,980
anything more to say?

857
3446
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:22,070
<i>That I have a gift that I bought for you,</i>

858
3450
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:24,320
<i>I wanted to say that.</i>

859
3454
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:34,880
<i>The soccer matches that you and I should watch together,</i>

860
3458
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:38,430
<i>that there were so many left, still.</i>

861
3462
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:42,190
<i>That is what I wanted to say.</i>

862
3466
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,250
<i>However...</i>

863
3470
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:51,180
No.

864
3474
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:58,890
♫ <i>and hope again that tomorrow will be different</i> ♫

865
3478
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:02,780
♫ <i>I can't walk even one step</i> ♫

866
3482
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:09,030
♫ <i>for a brief moment, I imagine a day that is fine</i> ♫

867
3486
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:15,920
<i>I bought it as I was passing by. You said you wanted to read this book, right?</i>
♫ <i>that day that is like a movie</i> ♫

868
3491
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,160
<i>If I say these words now...</i>

869
3495
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,620
<i>Those words, too...</i>

870
3499
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:24,400
<i>they will go into her heart</i>

871
3503
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,180
<i>and like a heavy last will and testament</i>

872
3507
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:31,300
<i>they will probably remain.</i>

873
3511
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,830
I will be going.

874
3515
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:38,820
Don't see me out.

875
3519
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,110
Yes.

876
3523
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:50,810
When you watch a soccer match

877
3527
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:54,500
have you ever been curious about this?

878
3531
01:11:56,230 --> 01:12:00,110
During the intermission in the half time...

879
3535
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:02,960
What do the players do?

880
3539
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,650
They evaluate their performance in the first half or plan their play in the last half,

881
3543
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:13,380
or perhaps eat some bananas, I imagine?

882
3547
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:14,790
Hmm.

883
3551
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:18,860
If you think about it, there is a lot they could be doing.

884
3555
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,010
Yes.

885
3559
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:22,800
It seems so.

886
3563
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:27,050
Yes, indeed.

887
3567
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:29,750
Should we shake hands?

888
3571
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:40,150
I wish you the best.

889
3575
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,060
For the both of us.

890
3579
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,920
Because it's our first time getting divorced.

891
3583
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:58,170
Yes.

892
3587
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:02,130
I wish you the best.

893
3591
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,020
You too.

894
3595
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:40,170
<i>Again,</i>

895
3599
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,750
<i>I am</i>

896
3603
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,650
<i>alone.</i>

897
3607
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:09,650
<i>To the middle, a shot </i>

898
3611
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:11,620
<i>It went off to the side. </i>

899
3615
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:14,560
<i>Now, Sanchez. Sanchez!</i>

900
3619
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,140
Yes, good! So good!

901
3623
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:23,890
Sanchez.

902
3627
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:28,090
<i>Cahill made a big mistake here.</i>

903
3631
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:31,880
<i>It seems Sanchez was ready. Here is the replay.</i>

904
3635
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:37,000
<i> Cahill wasn't prepared for this pass.</i>

905
3639
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,250
<i>On the other hand, Sanchez had a clear view and was able to speed up</i>

906
3643
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,280
Kitty.

907
3647
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:57,740
Kitty.

908
3651
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:06,110
Kitty?

909
3655
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:52,950
Where did you go?

910
3659
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:02,400
<i>[Woori</i> (Us/Our)<i>]</i>

911
3663
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:07,540
<i>I named her. It's Woori.</i>

912
3667
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:13,430
<i>Aside from ramyeon, this is the first meal.</i>

913
3671
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:15,170
<i>Us, together.</i>

914
3675
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,800
<i>I also think loving once is enough</i>

915
3679
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,270
<i>in life.</i>

916
3683
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:27,610
<i>Even if it's a sea that you've seen in the past</i>

917
3687
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:31,760
<i>today, this sea is the first.</i>

918
3691
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,920
<i>Just like our marriage.</i>

919
3695
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:40,340
<i>Like the kiss at the bus stop.</i>

920
3699
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,680
<i>Can I kiss you?</i>

921
3703
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,770
<i>Yes.</i>

922
3707
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:15,950
♫ <i>just like today, I endure another day</i> ♫

923
