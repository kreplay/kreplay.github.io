13
54
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,330
Are you going to work tomorrow?

14
58
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,790
What?

15
62
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,980
Of course. I have to.

16
66
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,790
I'm a new employee, I should go in early.

17
70
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,120
How would you feel about not going?

18
74
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,110
If I don't…I'll get fired.

19
78
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,200
Why do you ask?

20
82
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,310
Tomorrow, Cat…

21
86
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,120
Could you take her to the vet?

22
90
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,200
Ah, tomorrow?

23
94
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,720
- Yes, then, I will, tomorrow early afternoon.
- No, in the morning.

24
99
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,660
I'm hoping you could really go in the morning.

25
103
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,810
Ah…ok. I'll do that.

26
107
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,270
I mean, when I offered to go, he said adamantly no.

27
111
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,500
Why is he like that all of a sudden?

28
115
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,390
The cube-formula like brains of those science majors.

29
119
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,870
How would a literature girl like me understand?

30
123
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,840
Could I change my hours for tomorrow?

31
127
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,050
"You only love one."

32
131
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,200
What a random English phrase.

33
135
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,860
This kid really didn't study much.

34
139
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,090
But he's seen a thing or two, I guess.

35
143
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,960
Yes, Bomi-nim. Excuse me for calling so late.

36
147
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,360
The list of of reported people I sent you, Young Bok Nam…

37
151
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,760
The reason for the report is for stalking.

38
155
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,710
Where and how did that report come about?

39
159
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,660
I sent you the veterinary clinic address by text message.

40
163
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,890
It's the usual clinic I always take him to.

41
167
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,620
He should be familiar with it.

42
171
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,950
Yes. I suppose it will be done by around lunch time?

43
175
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,960
I'll tell you the result as I leave.

44
179
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,580
No. Depending on the condition,

45
183
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,140
there could be additional exams.

46
187
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,480
Please take care of those as well.

47
191
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,780
Use this to pay for the bill. Please take a taxi.

48
195
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,380
It's alright. There's a bus that goes there straight.

49
199
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,120
No, I mean…I don't think it will be okay for Cat.

50
203
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,000
He's never been to a place with lots of people.

51
207
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,560
Oh. About the examination . . .

52
211
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,700
How much did you want?

53
215
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,610
Some animal hospitals tend to add on this and that to incur additional costs, it seems.

54
219
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,540
Do all of them. Whatever the doctor says. All.

55
223
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,160
And pay in one single payment, please.

56
227
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,220
Okay.

57
231
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,370
Today… come back safely.

58
235
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,530
Then…see you later.

59
239
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,730
<i>Nope. Because I feel like I will do something wrong.
 </i>

60
244
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,580

61
248
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,550
- What? 
- Oh, and it wasn't 303, it was 304.

62
253
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,400

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,070

- Oh, Bo Mi!

74
304
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Drink up this fresh air of the morning!

75
308
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,400
This isn't the time for you to be filming "500 Days of Summer" in front of the office.

76
312
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,070
Let's go in.

77
316
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,080
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning!

78
321
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,730
<i>Roster of members with reports. </i>

79
325
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,000
Did you call the person who reported him?

80
329
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,860
They used our app's chatting function to chat.

81
333
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,730
They exchanged phone numbers and spoke and became friendly.

82
337
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,400
But she started not to respond much and that's when he started to  text and call like crazy, I think.

83
341
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,990
So she blocked him, and then he called her at work.

84
345
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,860
If this is true, it's really serious.

85
349
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,920
Though people do file false reports, too.

86
353
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,300
We need to verify whether it's true, and be accurate.

87
357
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,860
Could we get the blacklists from other apps?

88
361
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,690
I could get that through Won Seok, I think.

89
365
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,560
Bomi-nim, could you come with me?

90
369
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,050
Yes.

91
373
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,820
He's very dependable, right?

92
377
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,760
- What?
- Se Hee.

93
382
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,700
He's a very manly type.

94
386
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,470
Oh. Well, if I had to pick one thing to say about him, that wouldn't be it.

95
390
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,060
It's ok, you can brag about him in front of us!

96
394
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,730
There's no one in this hospital who doesn't know Se Hee is a man's man.

97
398
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,630
A man's man?

98
402
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,220
I mean, when he first brought her, he was so angry…

99
406
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,860
So our nurses gave him a nickname, "man's man."

100
410
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,130
He got angry? Really?

101
414
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,080
I guess you didn't know.

102
418
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,190
Back then Cat's condition was really bad.

103
422
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,000
I told him it's better to just prepare himself for the worst.

104
426
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,170
And he smacked the table here and was very angry.

105
430
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:24,570
He said that was a very irresponsible thing for me to say and that he didn't care how much it costs, but I had to cure him.

106
434
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,400
Back then he wasn't even the owner, I think.

107
438
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,040
Yup. Someone threw him away. Cat was dying on the street when Se Hee brought him here.

108
442
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,860
He ran here in the middle of the night.

109
446
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,190
You married really well.

110
450
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,160
No man who loves animals is a bad guy. Right?

111
454
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,550
Right. Though the issue is that he only cares about animals.

112
458
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,570
You're not supposed to fall for those words before you marry him, huh?

113
462
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,130
Ah…you two are married to each other?

114
466
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,190
Oh, welcome!

115
470
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,040
It's not lunch time yet. You came early.

116
474
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,970
- Yes, to buy some snacks. 
- Just in time since we got a new menu out today.

117
479
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,630
- Please try it. 
- Yes.

118
484
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,730
Oh, you're here? Ji Ho noona said she will be coming a bit late today.

119
488
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,040
Yes, she will.

120
492
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,840
Have a taste.

121
496
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,400
Wow. Wrap up five of these for me.

122
500
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,870
Okay.

123
504
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,970
I guess you've got stuff that's dropping your sugar level since early morning.

124
508
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,060
Maybe your boss is making you do too much work?

125
512
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,770
They're always giving me a lot of work.

126
516
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,690
Your bag looks like it would be heavy. You have a lot of tools.

127
520
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,030
Well, there are must-haves for people who ride the motorcycle.

128
524
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,730
Since we need them to carry out the work.

129
528
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,490
What kind of work?

130
532
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,750
Well, fixing the motorcycle and fixing a woman's heart too.

131
536
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,250
I'll help you settle the bill.

132
540
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,860
It's $26 dollars.

133
544
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,330
Sign.

134
548
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,920
You changed your signature.

135
552
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,680
This is the first time I signed here. Last time, I paid by cash.

136
556
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,060
Is that right? I guess I mixed you up with someone else.

137
560
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,540
Would you like to try that?

138
564
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,750
Three years ago?

139
568
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,650
He ran holding Cat?

140
572
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,330
My landlord? That neocortex?

141
576
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,420
No.

142
580
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,480
- What's this? 
- Ji Ho!

143
585
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,580
What? You didn't go to work at the cafe?

144
589
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,600
I had something to do so I'm just going to work now. What about you guys? Where are you going?

145
593
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Where else? To your cafe, of course.

146
597
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,370
Tada. Bok Nam gave us a ton of coupons so we can't waste it.

147
601
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,940
You're not busy? You're not going to your work?

148
605
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,880
I've got work outside the company today. I've got a lot of time before the evening.

149
609
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,480
And I have a day off. Let's go.

150
613
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,020
Maybe it's just a false report. He just looks so nice.

151
617
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,110
You also look ordinary from afar.

152
621
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,030
That thing. I looked into how much it costs, and it's really expensive, they say.

153
625
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,020
You must be curious how much it costs, right?

154
629
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,420
Nope. Not really. It's not even my house price, so why?

155
633
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,960
That's true. You're not interested in stuff like this.

156
637
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,170
Well, since you troubled yourself to find out, let's hear it.

157
641
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,850
How much is it?

158
645
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,020
Hey, it's Brother-in-law!

159
649
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,300
- But who's that next to him?
- I know, right?

160
654
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,360
Who is that?

161
658
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,570
That bike is to die for.

162
662
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,290
I only saw it ever displayed in the stores. But I guess someone actually goes around riding it.

163
666
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,140
That's Bok Nam's.

164
670
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,860
Really? That's Bok Nam's, you say?

165
674
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,520
That's got to cost at least as much as a mid-sized car.

166
678
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Really?

167
682
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,770
It's daebak, right?

168
686
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,800
No. Well, not as much as I thought.

169
690
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,630
Shall we go back? I think we've been absent for too long.

170
694
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,510
Be careful, Se Hee. The back mirror is at least a week's worth of our overtime pay.

171
698
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,690
I think it's probably more than that even.

172
702
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,430
Be careful. Or else you'd be paying until 2048,

173
706
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,650
along with your home loan.

174
710
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,470
I think you exaggerate a bit much.

175
714
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,550
To compare a back mirror and a home loan as the same category.

176
718
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,620
This little back mirror, how bad could it actually cost.

177
722
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,740
My motorcycle.

178
726
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,630
Se Hee.

179
730
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,040
Ji Ho! Hey, what do we do about your husband?

180
734
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,100
<i>Episode 8
Because This Is My First Husband</i>

181
739
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,660
Oh my. Smells like poop.

182
743
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,130
What the!

183
747
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,790
So you sleep here. I'm sorry.

184
751
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,110
Oh, Won Seok.

185
755
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,190
How come you came all the way here?

186
759
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,180
To this office... without even a place to sit.

187
763
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,350
I should've come sooner. I'm sorry.

188
767
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,070
And put this somewhere in your office.

189
771
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,210
This is a plant that freshens the air.

190
775
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,330
It's the best for those bad people who don't let any fresh air in.

191
779
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,570
Thank you.

192
783
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,290
Let's see.

193
787
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,790
Byeong Tae, where should I put this? Byeong Tae!

194
791
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,620
Sang Hoon, where should I put this?

195
795
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,230
It's not even food. Put it where?

196
799
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,330
You just hold it and stand there, then.

197
803
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,180
Oh. Alright.

198
807
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,660
- Let's go out, Hyung. 
- Yup, shall we?

199
812
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,110
I'm sorry.

200
816
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,950
Thanks.

201
820
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,100
But what's with the atmosphere in your office?

202
824
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,830
Sang Hoon is about to get dumped by his girlfriend of five years.

203
828
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,900
The scary looking kid who was sleeping on the sofa.

204
832
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,130
I see. That's why he had that look of sting.

205
836
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,570
But why be so petty about it when young people meet and break up all the time?

206
840
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,940
The girlfriend's family told her to break up with him if he keeps on making the 'app' or 'opp' or whatever.

207
844
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,980
Saying something like they won't consent to them marrying if he doesn't get a job by the end of the year.

208
848
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,310
I see.

209
852
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,920
I'm at a crisis too.

210
856
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,150
This is too cruel. Work, and my dating life, too.

211
860
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,790
I've been put on a forced abstinence.

212
864
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,710
- Rang said she doesn't want to do it with me.
- Won't do what?

213
869
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,900
- Why? 
- She says she's uneasy about doing it with a man who isn't thinking of marriage.

214
874
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,420
She said if we do it . . .  ugh this is so embarrassing.

215
878
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,500
She said to do it with two on.

216
882
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,760
It's not as if they are socks. Put two on? What a disaster.

217
886
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,320
So I'm pondering it seriously. This marriage thing.

218
890
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,360
Hey, I can see how it's stressful.

219
894
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,820
It's not just a mountain that you can climb over.

220
898
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,660
The offer I made you before is still valid, so call me when you're interested.

221
902
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,570
Thank you, Hyung.

222
906
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,150
Show me the picture of the guy you mentioned.

223
910
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,170
It's him. Can you find out if he's been blacklisted on other matchmaking sites?

224
914
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,330
I will look into it. But what is your plan though?

225
918
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,090
You said he works with Ji Ho.

226
922
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,690
I know. I mean, if this was just a normal blacklist, I can just kick him out.

227
926
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,990
But I'm worried because of Sister-in-law.

228
930
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,470
Since he works with her, I can't just make any moves too soon either.

229
934
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,490
But it's a relief anyway. The fact that her husband is involved.

230
938
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,530
He's the top 1% brain in the field, too.

231
942
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,650
That's true. Who's our Chief Nam?

232
946
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,560
He's cool-headed and meticulous and even if you poke him with a needle, he probably won't even shed a drop of blood.

233
950
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,560
I had to stitch more than I thought I needed to.

234
954
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,250
Be careful not to get water on it and come back again in a week.

235
958
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,200
- Yes. 
- You hit the ground, right?

236
963
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,630
How did that happen?

237
967
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,230
Huh? Who's his guardian?

238
971
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,390
Oh, me. A motorcycle . . .

239
975
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,500
You did that riding a motorcycle?

240
979
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,860
So, we'll need a full-body x-ray then.

241
983
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,190
So you were a biker! No wonder.

242
987
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,170
Your eyes.

243
991
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:27,360
No, it wasn't that he was riding the motorcycle. He was trying to avoid it.

244
995
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,660
- He was trying to avoid it.
- A motorcycle that was coming towards him?

245
1000
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,730
Then, wouldn't we need to get him a CT scan?

246
1004
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,090
Well, it wasn't a motorcycle that was moving.

247
1008
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,350
So, it happened while I tried to avoid a parked motorcycle by myself.

248
1012
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,110
What? Why?

249
1016
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,630
Why?

250
1020
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,030
Nah. It couldn't be because the motorcycle is super expensive?

251
1024
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,930
So you didn't want it getting scratched so you tried to avoid it and fell to the ground . . .

252
1028
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,150
You're crazy!

253
1032
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,330
It can't be something like that, right?

254
1036
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:04,690
No matter how much expensive a motorcycle is, what crazy punk would switch it with his own life?

255
1040
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,370
Then, I'll see you in a week.

256
1044
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,440
Brother-in-law is so athletic.

257
1048
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,240
Yeah. How did he manage to fly like that.

258
1052
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,300
I think he could totally be a diving athlete.

259
1056
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,210
Athlete, my butt.

260
1060
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,180
JI Ho must be so embarrassed. Wouldn't you say?

261
1064
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,470
Well... I don't think that's necessary.

262
1068
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,370
She should be. How much can a motorcycle back mirror cost?

263
1072
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,760
His wife's friends saw clearly how he tethered on the ground trying to avoid it.

264
1076
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,620
If it were me, I would've pretended like I didn't know him out of embarrassment.

265
1080
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,090
But why did you get in this car? Don't you need to go to work?

266
1084
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,420
I do. But I can't go pegged between a husband and wife.

267
1088
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,480
With the atmosphere already awkward.

268
1092
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,110
Take a left up ahead and drop me off at the intersection, please.

269
1096
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,320
Oh, sure. Since it's on our way.

270
1100
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,780
What do you mean it's on the way?

271
1104
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:17,050
Oh, but the two of you . . . by chance, do you know that Bok Nam well?

272
1108
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,630
Well, not exactly well, but why? You're interested in him?

273
1112
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,480
Can't be. You're one of the matchmaking app creators. You wouldn't not know about his level.

274
1116
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,730
But still. I'm sure my level is higher than yours.

275
1120
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,960
You haven't done this, right? Getting your level on our app?

276
1124
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,770
I don't need to, you see. Since I've got a boyfriend.

277
1128
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,600
Honestly, isn't that for people who are kind of lacking in self-esteem?

278
1132
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,860
Oh. So you've got a boyfriend and you've got self-esteem.

279
1136
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,680
It's just tactfulness that you lack.

280
1140
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,130
What did you say?

281
1144
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,760
What a funny person.

282
1148
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,560
There you go.

283
1152
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,110
It doesn't hurt?

284
1156
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,690
Yes, it's fine.

285
1160
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,130
Why did you do that?

286
1164
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,920
If you just grabbed the motorcycle,

287
1168
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,620
you wouldn't have gotten injured.

288
1172
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,430
If I had grabbed the motorcycle, it would have fallen or broken.

289
1176
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,420
But it's still better that the motorcycle gets broken.

290
1180
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,970
is it better to have a person get hurt?

291
1184
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,220
Well, it's not about which is right or wrong.

292
1188
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,770
In the end, my treatment cost is less than the motorcycle repair cost.

293
1192
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,810
<i>Se Hee. He's a very manly type. </i>

294
1196
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,460
<i>He smacked here and was very angry. </i>

295
1200
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,080
<i>Our nurses gave him a nickname. "Macho man". </i>

296
1204
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,960
What mancho man.

297
1208
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,240
What?

298
1212
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,840
Nothing. They said to come get the cat in the evening.

299
1216
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,060
They still have some exams left.

300
1220
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,750
I see. Thank you.

301
1224
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,380
Shall we go?

302
1228
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,310
You're headed back to your work, right?

303
1232
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,690
Yes. What about you, Ji Ho? Are you heading to that cafe?

304
1236
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,900
Yes. If I skip the afternoon too, I think I might really get sacked.

305
1240
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,870
So I should go in.

306
1244
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,170
Did you have something to say to me?

307
1248
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,350
That cafe . . .

308
1252
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,290
Yes?

309
1256
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:01,810
Until when were you planning on working at that cafe?

310
1260
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,280
Well, unless I get fired,

311
1264
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,470
I think for now, I will continue to.

312
1268
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,530
Why do you ask that?

313
1272
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:16,000
No. I was wondering if there's actually a reason why it had to be that cafe.

314
1276
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,170
There are lots of other places around the home.

315
1280
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,530
So I mean, there are lots of places you could just walk to.

316
1284
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,850
I wonder if you had to go all the way there, I mean.

317
1288
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,960
By chance . . .  is it because it bothers you?

318
1292
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,880
Are you that worried about your company people?

319
1296
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,890
Their coming to the cafe?

320
1300
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,850
- Well, it's . . .
- If it's that, don't worry.

321
1305
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:52,460
As you said, situations where we have to act like husband and wife,

322
1309
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,250
I'm avoiding them as much as I can too.

323
1313
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,120
And also, the cafes around the home. I've been to them all.

324
1317
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,300
None of them hired me.

325
1321
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,690
And in my current situation, a part-time job I can get,

326
1325
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,700
aren't many.

327
1329
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,510
And this cafe, it was thanks to Bok Nam that I got to work there too.

328
1333
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:19,860
So to me, it's actually a job that came to me difficultly.

329
1337
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,710
Please don't say it so lightly.

330
1341
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,830
<i>Pharmacy</i>

331
1345
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,030
Then, see you at home.

332
1349
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,650
Yes.

333
1353
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:43,710
♫ <i>I will entrust my heart in your care briefly. You may pass by, </i> ♫

334
1357
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,870
♫ <i>and just look at it carelessly. </i> ♫

335
1361
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,730
<i>By personal feelings, you mean, the fact that I like you? </i>

336
1365
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,720
<i>When I'm with you, I'm bothered about it and I'm curious about what you're doing then I miss you. </i>

337
1369
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,300
<i>I just don't like it!</i>

338
1373
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,460
<i>Those bastards harassing you. </i>

339
1377
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,960
Oh, Deputy Woo, on cming back from Technobile?

340
1381
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,730
Yes. I stopped by the M Portal main office nearby too.

341
1385
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,940
Oh. Really?

342
1389
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,220
Then.

343
1393
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,230
Hey, did you see it? Not on.

344
1397
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,550
No way.

345
1401
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:07,520
I told you, I saw it more than once or twice. Want to bet?

346
1405
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,990
Did you guys hear about Deputy Woo?

347
1409
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,430
What about her?

348
1413
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:21,390
Oh, how the CEO of Goldbench tried to get close to her at the drink meeting?

349
1417
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,670
Really? How?

350
1421
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,770
- He did this, I heard. 
 -Is he crazy?

351
1426
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,790
So then? What did Deputy Woo do?

352
1430
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,690
From what's said on the chat, it wasn't what she did.

353
1434
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,390
It was Gyeolmalrae CEO that pounced back, with hefty curses.

354
1438
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,700
What? Why? I guess the two have something going on.

355
1442
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,900
Honestly, unless it's that, would he pounce away his future money?

356
1446
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,010
You know how Deputy Woo, when she does business out,

357
1450
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,320
she goes around without a bra, the rumor says.

358
1454
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,900
I guess he fell for that.

359
1458
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,740
Really? No bra? What? It's like she's going out for a hook up.

360
1462
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,800
Was that her style?

361
1466
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,850
I liked Deputy Woo. I'm so disappointed.

362
1470
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,210
What disappointed. Not like you two were close.

363
1474
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Wait for me.

364
1478
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,040
Mr. Heels?

365
1482
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,430
What? Who are you to call me . . .

366
1486
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,360
<i>The CEO and the guy with the heels. Move to the bride's side.</i>

367
1490
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,920
- Oh. 
- You brought the document the CEO asked for, right? Follow me.

368
1495
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,450
Yes. Where's Sang Goo hyung?

369
1499
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:10,560
An urgent meeting with a VIP so he went out. You can just talk with me.

370
1503
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,800
VIP?

371
1507
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,160
<i>Call me when you're done working. I'm at the cafe in front of your company right now. </i>

372
1511
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:41,340
I didn't send the text to ask you to come out. I said I was going to wait until you were off work.

373
1515
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,320
- What are you doing here? 
- What do you mean what?

374
1520
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,590
You saw my text.

375
1524
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:52,100
I came here like this so I could buy dinner for Ms. Woo Soo Jin who's toiling away with work all day.

376
1528
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,800
I'm working late today, since I've got a lot to do.

377
1532
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,760
Do you know what's nice about being the CEO?

378
1536
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,680
No matter how much work there is, I have no reason to worry about what others think about where I do that work.

379
1540
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,530
I'm really fine. I can just wait here while working.

380
1544
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,600
It's true though. I brought my work.

381
1548
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,440
See, the notebook,

382
1552
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,200
and the earphones and the mouse

383
1556
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,790
and the flower.

384
1560
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,560
Since it's day one starting today for us.

385
1564
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,590
So just one stem today. You can be greedy about flowers from now on. Here you go.

386
1568
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,490
What?

387
1572
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,630
Hey.

388
1576
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,790
- CEO Ma, come see me. 
- I'm seeing you this whole time though.

389
1581
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,590
Hurry and take the flower.

390
1585
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,330
Follow me.

391
1589
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,020
What's with this?

392
1593
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,900
Huh? What is? I told you. I'm buying you dinner.

393
1597
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,000
- Why this suddenly? 
- That's what I mean.

394
1602
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,900
Why is CEO Ma buying my dinner?

395
1606
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,560
And after coming suddenly in front of my work place, at that.

396
1610
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:14,560
Well . . . oh, so you're the type that prefer to go with the aloof exterior when you date.

397
1614
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,340
I said I wanted to sleep with you. Did I ever say I wanted to date you?

398
1618
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:25,570
CEO Ma. Are you some youth in your 20s?

399
1622
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,490
What?

400
1626
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,640
I think you're misunderstanding something big time here.

401
1630
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,840
That day, I just threw it out there.

402
1634
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,790
Because my body was craving it.

403
1638
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,060
And I thought,

404
1642
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,140
I thought you and I were the same category.

405
1646
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,370
But you are more innocent than I thought, so this is really throwing me off.

406
1650
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,740
Soo Ji.

407
1654
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,790
You're really so mean and bad!

408
1658
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,280
Yeah.

409
1662
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,570
I'm mean and bad.

410
1666
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,080
I'm so mean and bad and that's how I barely made it to today.

411
1670
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,680
So please stop acting silly, CEO Ma.

412
1674
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,680
Hey, Woo Soo Ji!

413
1678
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,650
What did you just say?

414
1682
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,550
Don't act silly?

415
1686
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,920
Did I say I wanted to something else with you?

416
1690
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,900
Let's eat a meal together.

417
1694
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,810
We have a connection so let's see each other.

418
1698
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:35,030
That's all I asked.

419
1702
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,840
Is that something for you to throw such a fit about?

420
1706
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,730
Look here.

421
1710
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,610
I think you must think the workplace is like some college club.

422
1714
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:48,430
No. School or club, once you date and break up, it's only the woman that loses out.

423
1718
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:52,320
The woman is the one who gets dissed. And it's the woman who has to quit and leave too.

424
1722
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,010
Do you get that?

425
1726
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,510
Why are you so twisted?

426
1730
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,300
I think it's you who's not very aware.

427
1734
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,980
It seems like the world has changed, right?

428
1738
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,800
But it's the same.

429
1742
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,870
So if you want to sleep with me so badly,

430
1746
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:19,210
go and sell off your company and come. Then I'll date you.

431
1750
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,100
<i>App: Shall We Meet? / YOLO Rider, (94) / Report: Stalking</i>

432
1754
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,640
So he was reported on this app, too?

433
1758
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,100
Yes.

434
1762
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,860
They exchanged numbers.

435
1766
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,130
And they chatted before she blocked him.

436
1770
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,600
But he started to stalk her with text and calls and hacked her SNS too.

437
1774
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,930
So it's the same as our report.

438
1778
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,570
But . . .

439
1782
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,650
You know about the Namgang Station rape case, right? It's similar to that pattern.

440
1786
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,400
It's not. How in the world does that face look like a criminal?

441
1790
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,820
Look here. If I sit still, people say that I look like a model too.

442
1794
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,790
I think this case was also after meeting in an online game.

443
1798
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,620
He got mad after getting blocked so he kept stalking her.

444
1802
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,220
You know SNS? He went to the location tagged on it and he kidnapped her.

445
1806
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,130
They haven't caught that criminal yet.

446
1810
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,960
They haven't caught the criminal?

447
1814
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,310
Right. They haven't. That is what I heard.

448
1818
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,190
My friend works at that game company.

449
1822
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,110
Ji Ho works with him, I heard.

450
1826
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,830
Maybe you should hurry and go and tell her?

451
1830
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,680
<i>There aren't many part-time jobs I can get in my current situation.</i>

452
1834
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,870
<i>That cafe too, it was thanks to Bok Nam that I got to work there.</i>

453
1838
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,200
<i>So it was actually a job that was difficult for me to get.</i>

454
1842
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,830
<i>Please don't talk about it so lightly. </i>

455
1846
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:55,270
Even if I let her know, it should be after I confirm the facts.

456
1850
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:59,910
If I rush to tell her and it's not true, it could be troubling for both parties.

457
1854
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,790
Ji Ho could lose her job.

458
1858
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,340
And this person too.

459
1862
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,980
It's just a part-time job, so she could just quit. There's no need to be so serious.

460
1866
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,960
A part-time job is still an important job to some people.

461
1870
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,380
I can't ruin that recklessly.

462
1874
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,760
And I don't want that to be because of me either.

463
1878
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,350
Your friend at the game company.

464
1882
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:26,300
Could you ask him to find out more about the Namgang Station case?

465
1886
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,260
- And information on the suspected member, too.
- Yes, I'll ask.

466
1891
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,190
But how did you injure your forehead?

467
1895
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,730
Oh. This is . . .

468
1899
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,150
an accident.

469
1903
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,960
A type of willful negligence.

470
1907
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,110
Today's coffee, one cup, strong.

471
1911
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,940
Yup.

472
1915
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,010
Here you go.

473
1919
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,580
You're finally having a day off. Why are you going around all day alone?

474
1923
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,470
What about Won Seok? You're not going to see him?

475
1927
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,880
He's got a lot to do today.

476
1931
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,260
It's pretty, right?

477
1935
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,300
This one is yours. It was on sale, so I bought an extra one.

478
1939
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,550
Me?

479
1943
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,150
Wear this?

480
1947
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,030
Why? Don't you like it?

481
1951
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:34,110
Then... do you want this one?

482
1955
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:38,180
No, that one is yours. This one is for Ji Ho Noona.

483
1959
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,820
Is that so?

484
1963
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,360
Little boy, saying all kinds of things.

485
1967
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,180
I know? I guess our Ji Ho looks so innocent and pure to men, huh?

486
1971
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:55,020
She doesn't look just innocent, she is innocent. White looks so good on her.

487
1975
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,770
Especially sleeveless looks. Her shoulders are so pretty, right?

488
1979
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:03,540
What are you saying? It's so cold, why would I wear something sleeveless?

489
1983
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,120
I know, right?

490
1987
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,900
You sound like you saw her shoulders already.

491
1991
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,840
Noona, you look prettier when you wear your hair up.

492
1995
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,430
When did you ever see me with

493
1999
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,980
my hair up? I haven't done that.

494
2003
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,630
Ah, well...

495
2007
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,010
I just meant that I think you would look pretty that way.

496
2011
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,090
Do I have to see it? It's obviously for pretty people.

497
2015
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,420
The cake is one me, Noona.

498
2019
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,640
Should I toss Won Seok out and take him home to raise instead?

499
2023
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,720
Aigoo, don't say things you don't mean.

500
2027
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,130
You bought all this sexy lingerie for Won Seok.

501
2031
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,030
Yes, I did buy it because of him.

502
2035
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,880
Tonight, I'm going to wear nothing but this...

503
2039
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,110
Oh, come on.

504
2043
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:54,190
and not let him lay one finger on my body.

505
2047
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,860
Huh?

506
2051
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,490
When I learn more information, I will contact you.

507
2055
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,320
Yes, we are grateful for all your help so far.

508
2059
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,100
Oh, I haven't had a chance to properly greet you.

509
2063
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,720
This is my business card.

510
2067
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,640
I'm a CEO of a startup myself.

511
2071
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,500
It's called "Awake Others." It's an alarm app.

512
2075
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,680
Oh, Awake Others.

513
2079
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,520
That app where you set alarms for your friends to wake them?

514
2083
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,340
Yes, that one. I made that.

515
2087
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,310
Oh, so you're the developer of Awake Others.

516
2091
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,120
We all used that together the other day, right?

517
2095
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,900
- You used my app?
 - Of course.

518
2100
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,540
We all used that app and we were surprised.

519
2104
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,810
Really?

520
2108
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,940
If we ever met the developer, we had something we really wanted to ask him.

521
2112
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,560
What is it? Please ask me.

522
2116
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,030
Why in the world did you make that app?

523
2120
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,080
Huh? Well,

524
2124
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,070
if you used it, you will know.

525
2128
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,990
There are times when you can't hear your alarm, and you keep sleeping.

526
2132
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,200
Then your friend will be awakened by your alarm.

527
2136
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,350
Then the friend will call you and wake you.

528
2140
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:07,130
Then can't you just set your alarm to repeat at a later time?

529
2144
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,020
Oh...

530
2148
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,820
that is true, but...

531
2152
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,700
Yes, there is that solution.

532
2156
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,560
But our company's motto is to connect people together.

533
2160
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,480
It's not about a regular alarm. It's a social media alarm.

534
2164
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,360
So between couples and close friends, they take care of each other's morning waking times,

535
2168
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,770
and deepen their relationship with each other, shall I say?

536
2172
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,770
But, does that make any money?

537
2176
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,550
What are your monthly sales?

538
2180
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,430
Ah, that...

539
2184
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,690
We don't

540
2188
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,450
make any sales.

541
2192
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:56,330
Sim Won Seok, learn how great the sin of rejecting marriage is, feel it down to your bones.

542
2196
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,520
Stab yourself in your thighs as you stare at this.

543
2200
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,570
You're home?

544
2204
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,440
What's wrong? What is it?

545
2208
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,390
Hey, Sim Won Seok. Lift your head. What's up?

546
2212
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,550
What? He asked why you made that app?

547
2216
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,100
Why would you make an app? So you can sell it, obviously.

548
2220
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,950
What a stupid question. Sheesh.

549
2224
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,600
Rang.

550
2228
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:06,870
I never knew that my app would be treated this way.

551
2232
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:10,130
There are so many dumb apps in this world.

552
2236
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,580
An app that makes your phone vibrate and scratch your back for you.

553
2240
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,460
What's so wrong with my app?

554
2244
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,970
I know. What is wrong with Awake Others?

555
2248
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:28,230
Because they're ranked #1 in the app store, they dare to look down on #257?

556
2252
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,890
I didn't think Brother-in-law was like this, but he is such a weird person.

557
2256
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,650
He's the one who rolled on the ground so he wouldn't have to pay for a back mirror.

558
2260
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,740
Huh?

559
2264
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,970
Really?

560
2268
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,450
This one is here and that is here.

561
2272
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,710
That's right.

562
2276
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,730
How many times do I have to teach you? You also broke a cup earlier.

563
2280
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,110
That was because the customer--

564
2284
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,800
If the customer drops a cup then the part-timer should go catch it before it hits the ground.

565
2288
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,770
Isn't that right?

566
2292
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,150
What?

567
2296
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,550
I will keep it a secret about what happened today from the owner.

568
2300
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,160
You owe me one. Pay me.

569
2304
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,880
Hey!

570
2308
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,000
<i>Landlord.</i>

571
2312
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,920
You have a call.

572
2316
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,420
Oh. Wait a sec.

573
2320
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,820
Yes. What's the matter?

574
2324
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,870
That is...

575
2328
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,720
Yes, what's the matter?

576
2332
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,950
That is...

577
2336
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,290
today, what time will you be home?

578
2340
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,240
I think I will be going home on time.

579
2344
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,560
Why?

580
2348
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,320
That is...

581
2352
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,690
today, Arsenal will be playing. A derby match.

582
2356
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,650
Ahhh... yes.

583
2360
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,260
But then, did you call because of that?

584
2364
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,560
In case you didn't know.

585
2368
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,850
Okay. Thank you.

586
2372
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:17,970
And also today... are you going home riding the bus?

587
2376
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,180
Yes. Probably.

588
2380
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,740
But then, why?

589
2384
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,740
<i>Going home by bus...</i>

590
2388
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,910
why do you keep asking since yesterday?

591
2392
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,210
That...

592
2396
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,870
that...

593
2400
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,260
I think it would be better for you to ride the bus.

594
2404
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:40,420
So... the bus is efficient and safe.

595
2408
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,260
So...

596
2412
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,510
The bus stops in front of the house in just one ride.

597
2416
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,060
Ahhh.

598
2420
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,420
That... I am being very strange right now, right?

599
2424
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,200
Yes.

600
2428
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,050
Yes.

601
2432
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,610
What about Cat?

602
2436
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,440
Did you go and get him?

603
2440
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,930
No, I will be going later.

604
2444
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,030
Is Cat...

605
2448
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,240
coming home riding a taxi just like earlier?

606
2452
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,000
<i>Yes. Since it is the end of the work day, he would be startled if there are so many people.</i>

607
2456
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,290
Ahhh.

608
2460
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,650
Yes.

609
2464
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,310
Then, I will see you for the soccer match.

610
2468
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,850
Yes.

611
2472
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,000
What the? Cat rides a taxi

612
2476
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,750
so why does he insist that I ride the bus and even calling me about it?

613
2480
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,370
What's with him since yesterday?

614
2484
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,730
<i>You have to pick the cat up by 7.</i>

615
2488
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,730
Do well.

616
2492
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,790
Why did you practice?
- I saw in the video.

617
2497
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,140
I really can't solve this.

618
2501
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,940
This is why it won't work for you.

619
2505
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,880
Sir Se Hee try solving this. Youre good at this.

620
2509
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,840
Mr. Se Hee, Mr. Se Hee.

621
2513
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,650
Show us.

622
2517
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,760
I can't do it, how do you do it?

623
2521
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,590
You always leave first.

624
2525
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,200
Get on.

625
2529
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,940
Not today.

626
2533
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,370
Why? Because your husband told you to ride the bus?

627
2537
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,430
What?

628
2541
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:36,260
I heard earlier. Don't you know that you can hear through the window if you talk over there?

629
2545
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,580
Stupid.

630
2549
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,490
Ahhh... Is that so?

631
2553
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,020
Go ahead. I will ride the bus today.

632
2557
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,290
You listen to your husband really well.

633
2561
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,500
A husband who doesn't even come to pick you up.

634
2565
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,510
It's not even a far distance. It's just one bus stop away

635
2569
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:59,280
so how could he not even come and pick you up once?

636
2573
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,560
He's busy.

637
2577
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,310
What? He's picking up the cat?

638
2581
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:10,330
To your husband the cat ranks first than you then.

639
2585
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,250
Get on, let's drink one beer.

640
2589
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,950
You also have a debt today that you have to pay.

641
2593
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,090
Should we? Should we go for a drink?

642
2597
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,790
<i>Private Best Seoul Driver</i>

643
2601
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,260
Really?

644
2605
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,390
He rolled on the floor to avoid the side mirror?

645
2609
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,420
Wow. That's great.

646
2613
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,910
So it's true, according to Hyung Sang Woo he's a loan-cat person.

647
2617
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,940
Huh? Loan-cat?

648
2621
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:34,090
Yeah. In his brain is only his loan and cat so that's what people in the company call him.

649
2625
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,590
All logic is matched with his loan

650
2629
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:39,810
and the little emotion he has is placed on his cat.

651
2633
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,860
He's one who doesn't usually ride taxis but

652
2637
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:48,840
to take the cat to the vet he rides a taxi, surgery fee and he only uses the best cat food.

653
2641
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,910
That brother-in-law is really strange.

654
2645
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,280
That's why.

655
2649
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,960
All the people around him thinks he's like this.

656
2653
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,940
Record? What record?

657
2657
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:05,400
Cube. He went to a cube competition and set a record.

658
2661
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,160
Cube?

659
2665
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,610
Ahhh! The children's toy that the kid downstairs is playing?

660
2669
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:15,050
Don't you just twit and turn that thing?

661
2673
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:16,540
What?

662
2677
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,470
Rang!

663
2681
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,630
Yes, Bomi.

664
2685
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:34,130
<i>Mr. Se Hee, I asked my uncle</i>

665
2689
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,510
<i>about that Namgak station case.</i>

666
2693
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,950
Yes, go ahead.

667
2697
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:42,600
<i>They still have not found the suspect but they have found an evidence that the culprit left behind.</i>

668
2701
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:57,900
Rang, Rang.

669
2705
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,390
This may seem easy but it is actually based on calculations.

670
2709
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:06,850
This has a lesser probability than winning lottery daily within two weeks.

671
2713
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:09,530
Where did you get that? Perhaps is it from the kid downstairs?

672
2717
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,930
Yeah. I borrowed it.

673
2721
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,780
Keep quiet. That's not important. This isn't something that could be matched while just turning it, you know.

674
2725
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,490
If you just recklessly touch this then you won't be able to solve it even if you die.

675
2729
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,520
You move every block, focus now.

676
2733
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,610
Keep quiet! Stop it! We were talking about Se Hee!

677
2737
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:35,900
You've been talking about that cube for 30 minutes. What did I tell you that I hate the most?

678
2741
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,880
I taught you for 7 years but how come you always miss out on that?

679
2745
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:07,350
<i>Why? Do you think I'm a dangerous person?</i>

680
2749
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,710
<i>Your signature has changed.</i>

681
2753
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,490
<i>You know the Namgak station case, right? It's the same as that.</i>

682
2757
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,090
<i>He got mad because he was blocked and kept stalking.</i>

683
2761
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:22,910
<i>He went to the location from the SNS and kidnapped her there.</i>

684
2765
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,210
<i>I think he used it as a weapon.</i>

685
2769
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,260
<i>And also fix a girl's heart.</i>

686
2773
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,100
<i> I must have what I want.</i>

687
2777
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,230
Driver...

688
2781
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,490
<i>Today, Arsenal will be playing.</i>

689
2785
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,500
It's nice.

690
2789
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,240
Why did you marry your husband?
- Huh?

691
2794
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,550
There must be a reason for you to marry him. What did you like about him?

692
2798
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,530
He's frugal.

693
2802
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:28,200
He has strong sense of living.

694
2806
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,580
You saw it too, the side mirror.

695
2810
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,080
Is that all? The reason why you married him?

696
2814
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,510
He has a stable job.

697
2818
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,010
He has a house too.

698
2822
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,380
Is that why you saved your husband as landlord?

699
2826
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,640
It's nice.

700
2830
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,760
Why did you marry your husband?

701
2834
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,930
- Huh?
- There must be a reason why you married him.

702
2839
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:58,010
What did you like about him?

703
2843
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,210
He's frugal. With a strong sense of survival.

704
2847
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:08,090
You saw, the side mirror.

705
2851
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:11,410
Is that all? The reason that you married him?

706
2855
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,980
He also has a stable job.

707
2859
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,690
He has a house too.

708
2863
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,730
Is that why you saved your husband as landlord?

709
2867
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:29,210
I saw when he called earlier, it showed "landlord."

710
2871
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:35,440
It's kind of a nickname.

711
2875
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,920
And not really your landlord?

712
2879
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,630
It is too.

713
2883
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,840
But I am also contributing.

714
2887
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,190
I do part-time work, recycle,

715
2891
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:51,030
and watch over the cat. And sometimes...

716
2895
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,850
I prepare breakfast for my husband.

717
2899
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,110
Well... even though it's really seldom.

718
2903
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,490
That's petty.

719
2907
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:07,400
I thought marriage... would be done for some other reason.

720
2911
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,660
May it be love or fate.

721
2915
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:15,690
Marriage isn't much too. It's just the same as a part-time work.

722
2919
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,850
And exchange between labor and capital.

723
2923
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,390
Are you very mad, Maam?

724
2927
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,090
Never mind. It''s not like it's the first time.

725
2931
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:48,900
I'm sorry. My doctor-illness came back again.

726
2935
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,100
Don't sit while kneeling, it's not good for circulation.

727
2939
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:58,160
I'm already upset as it is. Why go to someone else's company and cause this?

728
2943
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,830
They are very funny people.

729
2947
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:07,140
What is it to them if someone makes an alarm app or a game app?

730
2951
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:10,260
Rang...

731
2955
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,320
why do you want to marry me?

732
2959
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,000
What?
- The truth is, it's a bit...

733
2964
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,350
I can't even get an investor and have been the same for the last 3 years.

734
2968
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:27,820
I don't have money, car or a house. I don't have anything.

735
2972
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,870
Why do you want to marry me?

736
2976
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:34,130
What are you saying? I want to do it because it's you.

737
2980
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:40,180
Because it's me?
- That's right. Because it's you.

738
2985
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,410
Do I need another reason?

739
2989
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,460
<i>Landlord</i>

740
2993
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,710
<i>It's because it's that person.</i>

741
2997
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,600
Because it's him that's why I married him.

742
3001
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,930
His house or his work...

743
3005
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:35,370
though I can't say it's not because of those.

744
3009
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:39,190
Even if for the same conditions

745
3013
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:43,890
if it was not him, I won't do it.

746
3017
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,690
So don't say it that way.

747
3021
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:52,400
Though marriage isn't something so great.

748
3025
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,330
But still to hear that kind of thing from someone I don't know

749
3029
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,650
it's not insignificant.

750
3033
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,670
So I am someone who doesn't know, to you.

751
3037
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,980
So...

752
3041
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:16,710
if something happens here, do you think your husband would come and get you?

753
3045
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:21,130
What?
- No, even if you think of it that way

754
3050
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:24,730
your husband gets the cat riding a taxi and tells you to ride the bus.

755
3054
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,660
He doesn't care about you.

756
3058
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:31,630
Hey.

757
3062
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:37,760
Why aren't you answering? I guess you are not confident that he will come and get you.

758
3066
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:42,880
Yeah. I'm not confident! Satisfied?

759
3070
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,460
That's why... who said to get married to a fake husband?

760
3074
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:52,660
What?

761
3078
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,030
I drank all my beer.

762
3082
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,770
Do you want another one?

763
3086
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:03,760
What did you just...

764
3090
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,470
Why are you so startled?

765
3094
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,060
You think I wouldn't know?

766
3098
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:17,030
I am interested in you much more than you think. So I am not someone who doesn't know.

767
3102
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,790
Let's go and watch soccer.

768
3106
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,360
What are you doing now?

769
3110
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,930
Let go!

770
3114
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,430
What if I don't let go? Will you hit me?

771
3118
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:27,990
No. I don't hit people.

772
3122
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:29,980
It would cause a lot of money.

773
3126
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:44,860
I researched this earlier. Right, it's expensive.

774
3130
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:49,030
I will pay it with my house by 2048.

775
3134
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,820
My motorbike!

776
3138
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,330
Hurry.

777
3142
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,590
So that we can go home to our house.

778
3146
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,990
<i>As long as we don't work hard</i>

779
3150
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,360
<i>we won't be able to understand each other.</i>

780
3154
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:44,090
<i>In this world...</i>

781
3158
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,810
<i>love... exist</i>

782
3162
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:08,200
♫ <i>Even if I don't want love and it passes by </i> ♫

783
3166
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,490
♫ <i>When you're before me</i> ♫

784
3170
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:16,720
♫ <i>Oh, I will want to hold your hands and everything's fine.</i> ♫

785
3174
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,900
♫ <i>And I want to be in love with you.</i> ♫

786

01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:27,000
<i>Timing and Subtitles Brought to You by the Scrimp & Scrape Team @ Viki!</i>

787
3182
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,070
<i>You were at home. But why call?</i>

788
3186
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:32,020
<i>Because you are a trustworthy person, that's why I did it.</i>

789
3190
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,450
<i>You think we're not doing by our contract?</i>

790
3194
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,290
<i>So why did you have to save me as your landlord?</i>

791
3198
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:40,890
<i>You don't tell us about it, but I guess he cherishes his wife a lot.</i>

792
3202
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:45,170
<i>In front of others, call me husband.</i>

793
3206
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:47,130
<i>Why are you looking at me with those eyes?</i>

794
3210
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:50,190
<i>That... how?</i>

795
3214
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,460
<i>Get yourself together! Erase!</i>

796
3218
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:55,030
<i>What's wrong?</i>

797
3222
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,160
<i>Your nails has dead skin on it, take it off.</i>

798
3226
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,860
<i>Look properly! What dead skin?</i>

799
3230
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,600
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

800
3234
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,260
<i>I... have a person that I like. My husband.</i>
