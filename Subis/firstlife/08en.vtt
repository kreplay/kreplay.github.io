13
54
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,330
Are you going to work tomorrow?

14
58
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,790
What?

15
62
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,980
Of course. I have to.

16
66
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,790
I'm a new employee, so I should go in early.

17
70
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,120
How would you feel about not going?

18
74
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,110
If I don't I'll get fired.

19
78
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,200
Why do you ask?

20
82
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,310
Tomorrow, the cat...

21
86
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,120
Could you take her to the vet?

22
90
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,200
Ah, tomorrow?

23
94
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,720
- Yes, then, I will, tomorrow early afternoon—
- No, in the morning.

24
99
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,660
I'm really hoping you can go in the morning.

25
103
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,810
Ah. Okay. I'll do that.

26
107
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,270
I mean, when I offered to go, he adamantly said no.

27
111
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,500
Why is he like that all of a sudden?

28
115
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,390
The cube-formula like brains of those science majors.

29
119
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,870
How would a literature girl like me understand?

30
123
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,840
Could I change my hours for tomorrow?

31
127
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,050
"You only love one."

32
131
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,200
What a random English phrase.

33
135
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,860
This kid really didn't study much.

34
139
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,090
But he's seen a thing or two, I guess.

35
143
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,960
Yes, Bomi-nim. Excuse me for calling so late.

36
147
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,360
From the list of report incidents that you sent me, there is a Young Bok Nam.

37
151
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,760
The reason for the report is for stalking.

38
155
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,710
Where and how did that report come about?

39
159
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,660
I sent you the veterinary clinic address by text message.

40
163
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,890
It's the usual clinic I always take her to,

41
167
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,620
so she should be familiar with it.

42
171
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,950
Yes. I suppose it will be done by around lunchtime?

43
175
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,960
I'll tell you the result as I leave.

44
179
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,580
No. Depending on the condition,

45
183
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,140
there could be additional exams.

46
187
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,480
Please take care of those as well.

47
191
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,780
Use this to pay for the bill and for the transportation. Please take a taxi.

48
195
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,380
It's alright. There's a bus that goes straight there.

49
199
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,120
No, I mean I don't think it will be okay for Kitty.

50
203
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,000
She's never been to a place with lots of people.

51
207
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,560
Oh. About the examination . . .

52
211
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,700
How comprehensive an exam were you thinking of?

53
215
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,610
Some animal hospitals tend to add on this and that to incur additional costs, it seems.

54
219
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,540
Do all of them. Whatever the doctor says. All.

55
223
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,160
And pay in one single payment, please.

56
227
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,220
Okay.

57
231
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,370
Today… come back safely.

58
235
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,530
Then, see you later.

59
239
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,730
<i>Nope. Because I feel like I will do something wrong.

74
304
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Drink up this fresh air of the morning!

75
308
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,400
This isn't the time for you to be filming "500 Days of Summer" in front of the office.

76
312
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,070
Let's go in.

77
316
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,080
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning!

78
321
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,730
<i>Roster of members with reports. </i>

79
325
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,000
Did you call the person who reported him?

80
329
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,860
They used our app's chatting function to chat.

81
333
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,730
They exchanged phone numbers and spoke and became closer.

82
337
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,400
It seems like when she stopped responding as much, that's when he started to text and call like crazy, I think.

83
341
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,990
So she blocked him, and then he called her at work.

84
345
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,860
If this is true, it's really serious,

85
349
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,920
though people do file false reports too.

86
353
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,300
We need to verify whether it's true and be accurate.

87
357
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,860
Could we get the blacklists from other apps?

88
361
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,690
I could get that through Won Seok, I think.

89
365
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,560
Bomi-nim, could you come with me?

90
369
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,050
Yes.

91
373
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,820
He's very dependable, right?

92
377
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,760
- What?
 - Se Hee.

93
382
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,700
He's a very manly type.

94
386
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,470
Oh. Well, if I had to pick one thing to say about him, that wouldn't be it.

95
390
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,060
It's okay, you can brag about him in front of us!

96
394
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,730
There's no one in this hospital who doesn't know Se Hee is a macho man.

97
398
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,630
Macho man?

98
402
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,220
I mean, when he first brought her, he was so angry,

99
406
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,860
so our nurses gave him a nickname, "Macho Man."

100
410
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,130
He got angry? Really?

101
414
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,080
I guess you didn't know.

102
418
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,190
Back then, Kitty's condition was really bad.

103
422
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,000
I told him it's better to just prepare himself for the worst,

104
426
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,170
and he smacked the table here and was very angry.

105
430
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:24,570
He said that was a very irresponsible thing for me to say and that he didn't care how much it costs, but I had to cure her.

106
434
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,400
Back then he wasn't even the owner, I think.

107
438
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,040
Yup. Someone had thrown her away. Kitty was dying on the street when Se Hee brought her here.

108
442
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,860
He ran here in the middle of the night.

109
446
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,190
You married really well.

110
450
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,160
No man who loves animals is a bad guy. Right?

111
454
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,550
Right. Though the issue is when one only cares about animals.

112
458
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,570
You're not supposed to fall for those words before you marry him, huh?

113
462
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,130
Ah. You two are married to each other?

114
466
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,190
Oh, welcome!

115
470
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,040
It's not lunch time yet. You came early.

116
474
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,970
- Yes, to buy some snacks. 
- Just in time since we've got a new menu out today.

117
479
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,630
- Please try it. 
- Yes.

118
484
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,730
Oh, you're here? Ji Ho Noona said she will be coming a bit late today.

119
488
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,040
Yes, she will.

120
492
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,840
Have a taste.

121
496
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,400
Wow. Wrap up five of these for me.

122
500
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,870
Okay.

123
504
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,970
I guess you've got stuff that's dropping your sugar level since this early in the morning.

124
508
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,060
Maybe your boss is making you do too much work?

125
512
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,770
They're always giving me a lot of work.

126
516
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,690
Your bag looks like it would be heavy. You have a lot of hefty metal tools.

127
520
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,030
Well, those are must-haves for people who ride a motorcycle

128
524
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,730
since we need them to carry out the work.

129
528
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,490
What kind of work?

130
532
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,750
Well, fixing the motorcycle and fixing a woman's heart too.

131
536
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,250
I'll help you settle the bill.

132
540
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,860
It's $26 dollars.

133
544
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,330
Sign, please?

134
548
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,920
You changed your signature.

135
552
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,680
This is the first time I've signed here. Last time, I paid with cash.

136
556
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,060
Is that right? I guess I mixed you up with someone else.

137
560
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,540
Would you like to try that one too?

138
564
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,750
Three years ago?

139
568
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,650
He ran, holding Kitty?

140
572
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,330
My landlord? That neocortex?

141
576
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,420
No.

142
580
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,480
- What's this? 
- Ji Ho!

143
585
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,580
What? You didn't go to work at the cafe?

144
589
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,600
I had something to do so I'm just going to work now. What about you guys? Where are you going?

145
593
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Where else? To your cafe, of course.

146
597
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,370
Tada. Bok Nam gave us a ton of coupons so we can't waste them.

147
601
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,940
You're not busy? You're not going to your work?

148
605
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,880
I've got work outside the company today. I've got a lot of time this whole afternoon.

149
609
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,480
And I have a day off. Let's go.

150
613
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,020
Maybe it's just a false report. He just looks so nice.

151
617
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,110
You also look ordinary from afar.

152
621
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,030
That thing. I looked into how much it costs, and it's really expensive, they say.

153
625
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,020
You must be curious how much it costs, right?

154
629
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,420
Nope. Not really. It's not even my house price, so why?

155
633
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,960
That's true. You're not interested in stuff like this.

156
637
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,170
Well, since you troubled yourself to find out, let's hear it.

157
641
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,850
How much is it?

158
645
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,020
Hey, it's Brother-in-law!

159
649
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,300
- But who's that next to him?
 - I know, right?

160
654
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,360
Who is that?

161
658
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,570
That bike is to die for.

162
662
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,290
I only saw it ever displayed in the stores, but I guess someone actually goes around riding it.

163
666
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,140
That's Bok Nam's.

164
670
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,860
Really? That's Bok Nam's, you say?

165
674
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,520
That's got to cost at least as much as a mid-sized car.

166
678
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Really?

167
682
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,770
It's daebak, right?

168
686
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,800
No. Well, not as much as I thought.

169
690
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,630
Shall we go back? I think we've been absent for too long.

170
694
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,510
Be careful, Se Hee. The side mirror is at least a week's worth of our overtime pay.

171
698
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,690
I think it's probably more than that even.

172
702
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,430
Be careful, or else you'll be paying until 2048,

173
706
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,650
along with your home loan.

174
710
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,470
I think you exaggerate a bit much.

175
714
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,550
To compare a side mirror and a home loan in the same category.

176
718
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,620
This little side mirror, how much could it actually cost?

177
722
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,740
My motorcycle.

178
726
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,630
Se Hee.

179
730
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,040
Ji Ho! Hey, what do we do about your husband?

180
734
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,100
<i>Episode 8
 Because This Is My First Husband</i>

181
739
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,660
Oh my. Smells like poop.

182
743
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,130
What the!

183
747
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,790
So you sleep here. I'm sorry.

184
751
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,110
Oh, Won Seok.

185
755
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,190
How come you came all the way here

186
759
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,180
so this office without even a place to sit?

187
763
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,350
I should've come sooner. I'm sorry.

188
767
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,070
And put this somewhere in your office.

189
771
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,210
This is a plant that freshens the air.

190
775
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,330
It's the best for those bad people who don't let any fresh air in.

191
779
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,570
Thank you.

192
783
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,290
Let's see.

193
787
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,790
Byeong Tae, where should I put this? Byeong Tae!

194
791
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,620
Sang Hoon, where should I put this?

195
795
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,230
It's not even food. Put it where?

196
799
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,330
You just hold it and stand there, then.

197
803
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,180
Oh. Alright.

198
807
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,660
- Let's go out, Hyung. 
 - Yes, shall we?

199
812
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,110
I'm sorry.

200
816
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,950
Thanks.

201
820
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,100
But what's with the atmosphere in your office?

202
824
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,830
Sang Hoon is about to get dumped by his girlfriend of five years.

203
828
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,900
The scary looking kid who was sleeping on the sofa.

204
832
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,130
I see. That's why he had that look of death.

205
836
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,570
But why be so petty about it when young people meet and break up all the time?

206
840
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,940
The girlfriend's family told her to break up with him if he keeps on making the 'app' or 'opp' or whatever,

207
844
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,980
saying something like they won't consent to them marrying if he doesn't get a job by the end of the year.

208
848
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,310
I see.

209
852
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,920
I'm in a crisis too.

210
856
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,150
This is too cruel. Work, and my dating life, too.

211
860
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,790
I've been put on a forced abstinence.

212
864
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,710
- Rang said she doesn't want to do it with me.
 - Won't do what?

213
869
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,900
- Why? 
- She says she's uneasy about doing it with a man who isn't thinking of marriage.

214
874
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,420
She said if we do it . . . Ugh, this is so embarrassing.

215
878
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,500
She said to do it with two on.

216
882
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,760
It's not as if they are socks. Put two on? What a disaster.

217
886
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,320
So I'm pondering it seriously, this marriage thing.

218
890
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,360
Hey, I can see how it would be stressful for you.

219
894
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,820
It's not just a mountain that you can climb over.

220
898
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,660
The offer I made you before is still valid, so call me when you're interested.

221
902
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,570
Thank you, Hyung.

222
906
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,150
Show me the picture of the guy you mentioned.

223
910
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,170
It's him. Can you find out if he's been blacklisted on other matchmaking sites?

224
914
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,330
I will look into it. But what is your plan though?

225
918
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,090
You said he works with Ji Ho.

226
922
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,690
I know. I mean, if this was just a normal blacklist, I can just kick him out.

227
926
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,990
But I'm worried because it's Sister-in-law Ji Ho.

228
930
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,470
Since he works with her, I can't just make any moves too soon either.

229
934
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,490
But it's a relief anyway, the fact that her husband is involved.

230
938
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,530
He's the top 1% brain in the field, too.

231
942
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,650
That's true. Who's our Chief Nam?

232
946
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,560
He's cool-headed and meticulous and even if you poke him with a needle, he probably won't even shed a drop of blood.

233
950
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,560
I had to stitch more than I thought I needed to.

234
954
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,250
Be careful not to get water on it and come back again in a week.

235
958
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,200
- Yes. 
- You hit the ground, right?

236
963
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,630
How did that happen?

237
967
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,230
Huh? Who's his guardian?

238
971
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,390
Oh, me. A motorcycle . . .

239
975
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,500
You did that riding a motorcycle?

240
979
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,860
So, we'll need a full-body x-ray then.

241
983
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,190
So you were a biker! No wonder.

242
987
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,170
Your eyes.Yep.

243
991
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:27,360
No, it wasn't that he was riding the motorcycle. He was trying to avoid it.

244
995
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,660
- He was trying to avoid it.
 - A motorcycle that was coming towards him?

245
1000
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,730
Then, wouldn't we need to get him a CT scan?

246
1004
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,090
Well, it wasn't a motorcycle that was moving.

247
1008
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,350
So, it happened while I tried to avoid a parked motorcycle by myself.

248
1012
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,110
What? Why?

249
1016
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,630
Why?

250
1020
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,030
Nah. It couldn't be because the motorcycle is super expensive?

251
1024
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,930
So you didn't want it getting scratched so you tried to avoid it and fell to the ground?

252
1028
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,150
You're crazy!

253
1032
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,330
It can't be something like that, right?

254
1036
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:04,690
No matter how expensive a motorcycle is, what crazy punk would switch it with his own life?

255
1040
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,370
Then, I'll see you in a week.

256
1044
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,440
Brother-in-law is so athletic.

257
1048
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,240
Yeah. How did he manage to fly like that?

258
1052
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,300
I think he could totally be a diving athlete.

259
1056
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,210
Athlete, my butt.

260
1060
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,180
JI Ho must be so embarrassed. Wouldn't you say?

261
1064
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,470
- Well... 
 - I don't think that's necessary.

262
1069
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,370
She should be. How much can a motorcycle side mirror cost?

263
1073
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,760
His wife's friends saw clearly how he tumbled on the ground trying to avoid it.

264
1077
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,620
If it were me, I would've pretended like I didn't know him out of embarrassment.

265
1081
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,090
But why did you get in this car? Don't you need to go to work?

266
1085
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,420
I do. But I can't go pegged between a husband and wife

267
1089
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,480
with the atmosphere already awkward between them.

268
1093
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,110
Take a left up ahead and drop me off at the intersection, please.

269
1097
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,320
Oh, sure. Since it's on our way.

270
1101
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,780
What do you mean it's on the way?

271
1105
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:17,050
Oh, but the two of you. By chance, do you know that Bok Nam well?

272
1109
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,630
Well, not exactly well, but why? You're interested in him?

273
1113
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,480
Can't be. You're one of the matchmaking app creators. You wouldn't <i>not</i> know about your own level.

274
1117
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,730
But still, I'm sure my level is higher than yours.

275
1121
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,960
You haven't done this, right? Getting your level on our app?

276
1125
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,770
I don't need to, you see, since I've got a boyfriend.

277
1129
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,600
Honestly, isn't that for people who are kind of lacking in self-esteem?

278
1133
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,860
Oh. So you've got a boyfriend and you've got self-esteem.

279
1137
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,680
It's just tactfulness that you lack.

280
1141
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,130
What did you say?

281
1145
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,760
What a funny person.

282
1149
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,560
There you go.

283
1153
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,110
It doesn't hurt?

284
1157
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,690
No, it's fine.

285
1161
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,130
Why did you do that?

286
1165
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,920
If you'd just grabbed the motorcycle,

287
1169
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,620
you wouldn't have gotten injured.

288
1173
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,430
If I had grabbed the motorcycle, it would have fallen or broken.

289
1177
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,420
But it's still better if the motorcycle gets broken.

290
1181
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,970
Is it better to have a person get hurt, instead?

291
1185
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,220
Well, it's not about which is right or wrong.

292
1189
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,770
In the end, my treatment cost is less than the motorcycle repair cost.

293
1193
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,810
<i>Se Hee. He's a very manly type. </i>

294
1197
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,460
<i>He smacked the table here and was very angry. </i>

295
1201
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,080
<i>Our nurses gave him the nickname, "Macho Man."</i>

296
1205
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,960
"Macho man" my butt.

297
1209
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,240
What?

298
1213
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,840
Nothing. They said to come get Kitty in the evening.

299
1217
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,060
They still have some exams left.

300
1221
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,750
I see. Thank you.

301
1225
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,380
Shall we go?

302
1229
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,310
You're headed back to your work, right?

303
1233
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,690
Yes. What about you, Ji Ho? Are you heading to that cafe?

304
1237
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,900
Yes. If I skip the afternoon too, I think I might really get sacked,

305
1241
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,870
so I should go in.

306
1245
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,170
Did you have something to say to me?

307
1249
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,350
That cafe . . .

308
1253
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,290
Yes?

309
1257
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:01,810
Until when were you planning on working at that cafe?

310
1261
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,280
Well, as long as I don't get fired,

311
1265
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,470
I think for now, I will continue to.

312
1269
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,530
Why do you ask that?

313
1273
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:16,000
No. I was wondering if there is a reason why it had to be that particular cafe.

314
1277
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,170
There are lots of other places near home.

315
1281
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,530
So I mean, there are lots of places you could just walk to.

316
1285
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,850
So I was wondering if you had to go all the way there, I mean.

317
1289
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,960
By chance, is it because it bothers you?

318
1293
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,880
Are you that worried about your company people?

319
1297
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,890
Their coming to the cafe?

320
1301
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,850
- Well, it's—
 - If it's that, don't worry.

321
1306
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:52,460
As you said, situations where we have to act like husband and wife,

322
1310
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,250
I'm avoiding them as much as I can, too.

323
1314
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,120
And also, the cafes near home. I've been to them all.

324
1318
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,300
None of them hired me.

325
1322
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,690
And in my current situation, a part-time job I can get,

326
1326
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,700
there aren't many.

327
1330
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,510
And this cafe, it was thanks to Bok Nam that I got to work there at all.

328
1334
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:19,860
So to me, it's actually a job that came to me with difficulty.

329
1338
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,710
So please don't speak of it so lightly.

00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,650

Oh, Deputy Woo, coming back from Techno Valley?

340
1382
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,730
Yes. I stopped by the M Portal main office nearby too.

341
1386
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,940
Oh. Really?

342
1390
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,220
Then...

343
1394
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,230
Hey, did you see it? She didn't have one on.

344
1398
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,550
No way.

345
1402
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:07,520
I told you, I saw it more than once or twice. Want to bet?

346
1406
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,990
Did you guys hear about Deputy Woo?

347
1410
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,430
What about her?

348
1414
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:21,390
Oh, how the CEO of Gold Venture tried to get close to her at the drink meeting?

349
1418
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,670
Really? How?

350
1422
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,770
- He did this, I heard. 
 - Oh! Is he crazy?

351
1427
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,790
So then? What did Deputy Woo do?

352
1431
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,690
From what's said on the chat, it wasn't what she did.

353
1435
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,390
It was the startup CEO that pounced back in the end and totally cussed him out.

354
1439
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,700
What? Why? I guess the two have something going on.

355
1443
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,900
Honestly, unless it's not that, would he crush his own money lifeline?

356
1447
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,010
You know how Deputy Woo, whenever she does business out of the office,

357
1451
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,320
she goes around without a bra, the rumor says.

358
1455
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,900
I guess he fell for that.

359
1459
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,740
Really? No bra? What? It's like she's going out for a hook up.

360
1463
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,800
Was that her style?

361
1467
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,850
I liked Deputy Woo. I'm so disappointed.

362
1471
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,210
Disappointed? Were you two even close?

363
1475
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Wait for me.

- You brought the materials that the CEO asked for, right? Follow me.

Yes. Where's Sang Goo Hyung?

00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,800
VIP?

<i>Call me when you're done working. Let's eat dinner together. I'm at the cafe in front of your company right now. </i>

373
1516
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:41,340
I didn't send the text to ask you to come out. I said I was going to wait until you were off work.

374
1520
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,320
- What are you doing here? 
- What do you mean?

375
1525
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,590
You saw my text.

376
1529
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:52,100
I came here like this so I could buy dinner for Ms. Woo Soo Ji who's toiling away with work all day.

377
1533
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,800
I'm working late today since I've got a lot to do.

378
1537
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,760
Do you know what's nice about being the CEO?

379
1541
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,680
No matter how much work there is, I have no reason to worry about what others think about where I do that work.

380
1545
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,530
I'm really fine. I can just wait here while working.

381
1549
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,600
It's true though. I brought my work.

382
1553
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,440
See, the notebook,

383
1557
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,200
and the earphones and the mouse

384
1561
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,790
and the flower.

385
1565
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,560
Since starting today, it's day one for us.

386
1569
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,590
So just one stem today. You can be greedy about flowers from now on. Here you go.

387
1573
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,490
What?

388
1577
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,630
Hey.

389
1581
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,790
- CEO Ma, come see me. 
- I'm looking at you already.

390
1586
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,590
Hurry and take the flower.

391
1590
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,330
Follow me.

392
1594
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,020
What's with this?

393
1598
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,900
Huh? What is? I told you. I'm buying you dinner.

394
1602
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,000
- Why are you like this, suddenly? 
- That's what I mean.

395
1607
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,900
Why is CEO Ma buying my dinner?

396
1611
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,560
And after appearing suddenly in front of my workplace, at that.

397
1615
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:14,560
Well... Oh, so you're the 'tsundere' type when you date, huh?

398
1619
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,340
I said I wanted to sleep with you. Did I ever say I wanted to date you?

399
1623
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:25,570
CEO Ma. Are you some youth in your 20s?

400
1627
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,490
What?

401
1631
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,640
I think you're misunderstanding something big time here.

402
1635
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,840
That day, I just threw it out there

403
1639
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,790
because my body was craving it.

404
1643
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,060
And I thought,

405
1647
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,140
I thought you and I were in the same category.

406
1651
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,370
But you are more innocent than I thought, so this is really throwing me off.

407
1655
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,740
Soo Ji.

408
1659
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,790
You're really so mean and bad!

409
1663
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,280
Yeah.

410
1667
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,570
I'm mean and bad.

411
1671
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,080
I'm so mean and bad and that's how I barely made it to today.

412
1675
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,680
So please stop acting silly, CEO Ma.

413
1679
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,680
Hey, Woo Soo Ji!

414
1683
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,650
What did you just say?

415
1687
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,550
Don't act silly?

416
1691
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,920
Did I say I wanted to something else with you?

417
1695
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,900
Let's eat a meal together.

418
1699
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,810
We have a connection so let's see each other.

419
1703
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:35,030
That's all I asked.

420
1707
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,840
Is that something for you to throw such a fit about?

421
1711
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,730
Look here.

422
1715
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,610
I think you must think the workplace is like some college club.

423
1719
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:48,430
No. School or club, once you date and break up, it's only the woman that loses out.

424
1723
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:52,320
The woman is the one who gets dissed, and it's the woman who has to quit and leave too.

425
1727
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,010
Do you get that?

426
1731
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,510
Why are you so twisted?

427
1735
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,300
I think it's you who's not very aware.

428
1739
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,980
It seems like the world has changed, right?

429
1743
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,800
But it's the same.

430
1747
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,870
So if you want to sleep with me so badly,

431
1751
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:19,210
go and sell off your company and come. Then I'll date you.

432
1755
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,100
<i>App: Shall We Meet? / YOLO Rider, (94) / Report: Stalking</i>

433
1759
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,640
So he was reported on this app, too?

434
1763
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,100
Yes.

435
1767
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,860
They exchanged numbers,

436
1771
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,130
and they chatted before she blocked him.

437
1775
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,600
But he started to stalk her with texts and calls and hacked her SNS too.

438
1779
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,930
So it's the same as our report.

439
1783
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,570
But . . .

440
1787
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,650
You know about the Namgang Station confinement case, right? It's similar to that pattern.

441
1791
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,400
No way. How in the world does that face look like a criminal?

442
1795
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,820
Look here. If I sit still, people say that I look like a model too.

443
1799
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,790
I think this case was also after meeting in an online game.

444
1803
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,620
He got mad after getting blocked so he kept stalking her.

445
1807
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,220
You know SNS? He went to the location tagged on it and he kidnapped her.

446
1811
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,130
They haven't caught that criminal yet.

447
1815
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,960
They haven't caught the criminal?

448
1819
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,310
Right. They haven't. That is what I heard.

449
1823
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,190
My friend works at that game company.

450
1827
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,110
Ji Ho works with him, I heard.

451
1831
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,830
Maybe you should hurry and go tell her?

452
1835
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,680
<i>There aren't many part-time jobs I can get in my current situation.</i>

453
1839
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,870
<i>That cafe too, it was thanks to Bok Nam that I got to work there.</i>

454
1843
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,200
<i>So it was actually a job that was difficult for me to get.</i>

455
1847
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,830
<i>Please don't talk about it so lightly. </i>

456
1851
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:55,270
Even if I let her know, it should be after I confirm the facts.

457
1855
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:59,910
If I rush to tell her and it's not true, it could be troubling for both parties.

458
1859
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,790
Ji Ho could lose her job

459
1863
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,340
Aand this person too.

460
1867
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,980
It's just a part-time job, so she could just quit. There's no need to be so serious.

461
1871
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,960
A part-time job is still an important job to some people.

462
1875
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,380
I can't ruin that recklessly.

463
1879
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,760
And I don't want that to be because of me either.

464
1883
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,350
Your friend at the game company.

465
1887
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:26,300
Could you ask him to find out more about the Namgang Station case?

466
1891
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,260
- And information on the suspected member, too.
 - Yes, I'll ask.

467
1896
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,190
But how did you injure your forehead?

468
1900
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,730
Oh. This is . . .

469
1904
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,150
an accident.

470
1908
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,960
A type of willful negligence.

471
1912
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,110
Today's coffee, one cup, mild.

472
1916
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,940
Yup.

473
1920
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,010
Here you go.

474
1924
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,580
You're finally having a day off. Why are you going around all day alone?

475
1928
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,470
What about Won Seok? You're not going to see him?

476
1932
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,880
He's got a lot to do today.

477
1936
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,260
It's pretty, right?

478
1940
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,300
This one is yours. It was on sale, so I bought an extra one.

479
1944
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,550
Me?

480
1948
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,150
Wear this?

481
1952
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,030
Why? Don't you like it?

482
1956
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:34,110
Then, do you want this one?

483
1960
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:38,180
No, that one is yours. This one is for Ji Ho Noona.

484
1964
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,820
Is that so?

485
1968
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,360
Little boy, saying all kinds of things.

486
1972
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,180
I know? I guess our Ji Ho looks so innocent and pure to men, huh?

487
1976
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:55,020
She doesn't look just innocent, she is innocent. White looks so good on her.

488
1980
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,770
Especially sleeveless looks. Her shoulders are so pretty, right?

489
1984
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:03,540
What are you saying? It's so cold, why would I wear something sleeveless?

490
1988
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,120
I know, right?

491
1992
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,900
You sound like you saw her shoulders already.

492
1996
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,840
Noona, you look prettier when you wear your hair up.

493
2000
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,430
When did you ever see me with

494
2004
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,980
my hair up? I haven't done that.

495
2008
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,630
Ah, well...

496
2012
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,010
I just meant that I think you would look pretty that way.

497
2016
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,090
Do I have to see it? It's obviously for pretty people.

498
2020
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,420
The cake is on me, Noona.

499
2024
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,640
Should I toss Won Seok out and take him home to raise instead?

500
2028
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,720
Aigoo, don't say things you don't mean.

501
2032
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,130
You bought all this sexy lingerie for Won Seok.

502
2036
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,030
Yes, I did buy it because of him.

503
2040
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,880
Tonight, I'm going to wear nothing but this...

504
2044
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,110
Oh, come on.

505
2048
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:54,190
and not let him lay one finger on my body.

506
2052
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,860
Huh?

507
2056
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,490
When I learn more information, I will contact you.

508
2060
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,320
Yes, we are grateful for all your help so far.

509
2064
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,100
Oh, I haven't had a chance to properly greet you.

510
2068
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,720
This is my business card.

511
2072
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,640
I'm a CEO of a startup myself.

512
2076
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,500
It's called "Awake Others." It's an alarm app.

513
2080
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,680
Oh, Awake Others.

514
2084
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,520
That app where you set alarms for your friends to wake them?

515
2088
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,340
Yes, that one. I made that.

516
2092
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,310
Oh, so you're the developer of Awake Others.

517
2096
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,120
We all used that together the other day, right?

518
2100
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,900
- You used my app?
 - Of course.

519
2105
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,540
We all used that app and we were surprised.

520
2109
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,810
Really?

521
2113
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,940
If we ever met the developer, we had something we really wanted to ask him.

522
2117
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,560
What is it? Please ask me.

523
2121
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,030
Why in the world did you make that app?

524
2125
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,080
Huh? Well,

525
2129
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,070
if you used it, you will know.

526
2133
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,990
There are times when you can't hear your alarm, and you keep sleeping.

527
2137
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,200
Then your friend will be awakened by your alarm.

528
2141
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,350
Then the friend will call you and wake you.

529
2145
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:07,130
Then can't you just set your alarm to repeat at a later time?

530
2149
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,020
Oh.

531
2153
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,820
That is true, but...

532
2157
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,700
Yes, there is that solution,

533
2161
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,560
but our company's motto is to connect people together.

534
2165
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,480
It's not about a regular alarm. It's a social media alarm.

535
2169
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,360
So between couples and close friends, they take care of each other's morning waking times,

536
2173
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,770
and deepen their relationship with each other, shall I say?

537
2177
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,770
But, does that make any money?

538
2181
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,550
What are your monthly sales?

539
2185
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,430
Ah, that...

540
2189
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,690
We don't

541
2193
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,450
make any sales.

542
2197
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:56,330
Sim Won Seok, learn how great the sin of rejecting marriage is, feel it down to your bones.

543
2201
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,520
Stab yourself in your thighs as you stare at this.

544
2205
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,570
You're home?

545
2209
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,440
What's wrong? What is it?

546
2213
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,390
Hey, Sim Won Seok. Lift your head. What's up?

547
2217
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,550
What? He asked why you made that app?

548
2221
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,100
Why would you make an app? So you can sell it, obviously.

549
2225
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,950
What a stupid question. Sheesh.

550
2229
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,600
Rang.

551
2233
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:06,870
I never knew that my app would be treated this way.

552
2237
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:10,130
There are so many dumb apps in this world.

553
2241
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,680
Hand-warmer apps, apps that confirm your wealth at birth,

554
2245
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,580
even an app that makes your phone vibrate and scratch your back for you.

555
2249
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,460
What's so wrong with my app?

556
2253
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,970
I know. What is wrong with Awake Others?

557
2257
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:28,230
Because they're ranked #1 in the app store, they dare to look down on #257?

558
2261
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,890
I didn't think Brother-in-law was like this, but he is such a weird person.

559
2265
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,650
He's the one who rolled on the ground so he wouldn't have to pay for a back mirror.

560
2269
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,740
Huh?

561
2273
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,970
Really?

562
2277
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,450
This one is here and that is here.

563
2281
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,710
That's right.

564
2285
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,730
How many times do I have to teach you? You also broke a cup earlier.

565
2289
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,110
That was because the customer--

566
2293
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,800
If the customer drops a cup then the part-timer should go catch it before it hits the ground.

567
2297
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,770
Isn't that right?

568
2301
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,150
What?

569
2305
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,550
I will keep what happened today a secret from the owner.

570
2309
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,160
You owe me one. Pay me.

571
2313
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,880
Hey!

572
2317
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,000
<i>Landlord.</i>

573
2321
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,920
You have a call.

574
2325
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,420
Oh. Wait a sec.

575
2329
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,820
Yes. What's the matter?

576
2333
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,870
That is...

577
2337
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,720
Yes, what's the matter?

578
2341
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,950
That is...

579
2345
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,290
Today, what time will you be home?

580
2349
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,240
I think I will be going home on time.

581
2353
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,560
Why?

582
2357
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,320
That is,

583
2361
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,690
today, Arsenal will be playing. A derby match.

584
2365
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,650
Ahhh. Yes.

585
2369
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,260
But then, did you call because of that?

586
2373
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,560
In case you didn't know.

587
2377
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,850
Okay. Thank you.

588
2381
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:17,970
And also today, are you going home on the bus?

589
2385
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,180
Yes. Probably.

590
2389
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,740
But then, why?

591
2393
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,740
<i>Going home by bus.</i>

592
2397
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,910
Why do you keep asking since yesterday?

593
2401
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,210
That...

594
2405
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,870
That...

595
2409
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,260
I think it would be better for you to ride the bus.

596
2413
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:40,420
So, the bus is efficient and safe.

597
2417
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,260
So...

598
2421
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,510
The bus stops in front of the house in just one ride.

599
2425
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,060
Ahhh.

600
2429
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,420
That... I am being very strange right now, right?

601
2433
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,200
Yes.

602
2437
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,050
Yes.

603
2441
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,610
What about Kitty?

604
2445
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,440
Did you go and get her?

605
2449
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,930
No, I will be going later.

606
2453
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,030
Is Kitty

607
2457
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,240
coming home riding a taxi just like earlier?

608
2461
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,000
<i>Yes. Since it is the end of the work day, she would be startled if there are so many people.</i>

609
2465
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,290
Ahhh.

610
2469
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,650
Yes.

611
2473
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,310
Then, I will see you for the soccer match.

612
2477
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,850
Yes.

613
2481
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,000
What the? Kitty rides a taxi,

614
2485
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,750
so why does he insist that I ride the bus and even calls me about it?

615
2489
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,370
What's with him since yesterday?

616
2493
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,730
<i>You have to pick the cat up by 7.</i>

617
2497
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,730
Do well.

618
2501
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,790
- Why did you practice?
- I saw this in the video.

619
2506
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,140
I really can't solve this.

620
2510
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,940
This is why you're useless.

621
2514
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,880
Se Hee try solving this. You're good at this.

622
2518
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,400
You even set a record before.

623
2522
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,840
Mr. Se Hee, Mr. Se Hee.

624
2526
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,650
Show us.

625
2530
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,760
I can't do it. How do you do it?

626
2534
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,590
You always leave first.

627
2538
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,200
Get on.

628
2542
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,940
Not today.

629
2546
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,370
Why? Because your husband told you to ride the bus?

630
2550
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,430
What?

631
2554
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:36,260
I heard earlier. Don't you know that you can hear everything through the window if you talk over there?

632
2558
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,580
Silly.

633
2562
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,490
Ah. Is that so?

634
2566
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,020
Go ahead. I will ride the bus today.

635
2570
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,290
You listen to your husband really well.

636
2574
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,500
A husband who doesn't even come to pick you up.

637
2578
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,510
It's not even a far distance. It's just one bus stop away,

638
2582
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:59,280
so how could he not come and pick you up even once?

639
2586
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,560
He's busy.

640
2590
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,310
What? He's picking up the cat?

641
2594
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:10,330
To your husband, the cat ranks ahead of you then.

642
2598
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,250
Get on, let's drink one beer.

643
2602
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,950
You also have a debt today that you have to pay.

644
2606
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,090
Should we? Should we go for a drink?

645
2610
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,790
<i>Private Best Seoul Driver</i>

646
2614
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:52,940
The animal hospital near the Sang-bong station, please.

647
2618
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,260
Really?

648
2622
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,390
He rolled on the ground to avoid the side mirror?

649
2626
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,420
Wow. That's great.

650
2630
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,910
So it's true. Like Hyung Sang Gu said, he's a "left-loan, right-cat" person.

651
2634
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,940
Huh? "Left-loan, right-cat?"

652
2638
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:34,090
Yeah. His left brain is filled only with his loan and his right brain is filled only with his cat. So that's what people in the company call him.

653
2642
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,590
All his logic is taken up by his loan,

654
2646
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:39,810
and what little emotion he has is poured into his cat.

655
2650
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,860
Usually, he doesn't even ride taxis to save money to pay his loan.

656
2654
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:48,840
But to take the cat to the vet he rides a taxi, pays all surgery fees, and he only buys the best cat food.

657
2658
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,910
Brother-in-law is really strange.

658
2662
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,280
I know, right?

659
2666
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,960
People who work in this industry are all a little nuts.

660
2670
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,020
But even among them, he is the top 1%. He even set a record.

661
2674
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,940
Record? What record?

662
2678
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:05,400
Rubik's Cube. He went to a cube competition at his company and set a record.

663
2682
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,160
Cube?

664
2686
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,610
Ahhh! The children's toy that the kid downstairs is playing?

665
2690
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:15,050
Don't you just twist and turn that thing?

666
2694
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:16,540
What?

667
2698
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,470
Rang!

668
2702
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,630
Yes, Bo Mi.

669
2706
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:34,130
<i>Mr. Se Hee, I asked my uncle</i>

670
2710
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:36,510
<i>about that Namgak station confinement case.</i>

671
2714
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,950
Yes, go ahead.

672
2718
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:42,600
<i>They still have not found the suspect but they have found an evidence that the culprit left behind.</i>

673
2722
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,650
<i>What was that thing called? That thing that tightened bolts and nuts?</i>

674
2726
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,990
- "Spinner?"
 - You mean, a spanner?

675
2731
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:51,100
<i>Yes, that thing. A spanner. ("wrench" in North America)</i>

676
2735
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,490
<i>He just left that behind and fled. He used it as a weapon.</i>

677
2739
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:57,900
Rang, Rang.

678
2743
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,390
This may seem easy but it is actually based on calculations.

679
2747
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,890
Depending on the situation, there are 4000 possible moves you can make.

680
2751
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:06,850
This has a lower probability of success than winning the lottery daily for two weeks straight.

681
2755
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:09,530
Where did you get that? Perhaps is it from the kid downstairs?

682
2759
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,930
Yeah. I borrowed it.

683
2763
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,780
Keep quiet. That's not important. This isn't something that could be matched just by turning it willy-nilly, you know.

684
2767
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,490
If you just recklessly touch this then you won't be able to solve it even if you die.

685
2771
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:20,670
So someone who understands engineering must concentrate

686
2775
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:24,610
and find the clue and turn it one by one, like this, to solve the puzzle.

687
2779
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,520
You move every block, focus now. Listen.

688
2783
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,610
Keep quiet! Stop it! We were talking about Se Hee!

689
2787
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:35,900
You've been talking about that cube for 30 minutes. What did I tell you that I hate the most?

690
2791
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,260
When I talk about games or engineering, or games and engineering.

691
2795
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,880
I trained you for 7 years but how come you cannot quit?

692
2799
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,750
In my next life, I will never date an engineer.

693
2803
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:07,350
<i>Why? Do you think I'm a dangerous person?</i>

694
2807
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,710
<i>Your signature has changed.</i>

695
2811
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,490
<i>You know the Namgak station confinement case, right? The pattern is the same as that case.</i>

696
2815
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,090
<i>He got mad because he was blocked and kept stalking.</i>

697
2819
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:22,910
<i>He went to the location tagged from her SNS and kidnapped her there.</i>

698
2823
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,730
<i>Yes, that thing. A spanner.</i>

699
2827
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,210
<i>I think he used it as a weapon.</i>

700
2831
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,260
<i>And also fix a girl's heart.</i>

701
2835
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,100
<i> I must have what I want.</i>

702
2839
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,230
Driver.

703
2843
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,490
<i>Today, Arsenal will be playing.</i>

704
2847
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,500
It's nice.

705
2851
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,240
- Why did you marry your husband?
 - Huh?

706
2856
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,550
There must be a reason for you to marry him. What did you like about him?

707
2860
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,530
He's frugal.

708
2864
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:28,200
He has a strong sense of maintaining his livelihood.

709
2868
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,580
You saw it too, the side mirror.

710
2872
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,080
Is that all? The reason why you married him?

711
2876
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,510
He has a stable job.

712
2880
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,010
He has a house too.

713
2884
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,380
Is that why you saved your husband as "landlord" in your phone?

714
2888
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,640
It's nice.

715
2892
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,760
Why did you marry your husband?

716
2896
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,930
- Huh?
 - There must be a reason why you married him.

717
2901
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:58,010
What did you like about him?

718
2905
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,210
He's frugal. He has a strong sense of maintaining his livelihood.

719
2909
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:08,090
You saw the side mirror.

720
2913
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:11,410
Is that all? The reason that you married him?

721
2917
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,980
He also has a stable job.

722
2921
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,690
He has a house too.

723
2925
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,730
Is that why you saved your husband as "landlord" in your phone?

724
2929
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:29,210
I saw when he called earlier, it showed "landlord."

725
2933
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:35,440
It's kind of an affectionate nickname.

726
2937
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,920
So he's not really your landlord?

727
2941
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,630
Well, actually he is.

728
2945
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,840
But I am also contributing.

729
2949
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,190
I do part-time work, recycle,

730
2953
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:51,030
and watch over the cat. And sometimes...

731
2957
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,850
I prepare breakfast for my husband.

732
2961
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,110
Well, even though it's not very often.

733
2965
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,490
That's lame.

734
2969
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:07,400
I thought marriage would be done for some other reason.

735
2973
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,660
Like love, or fate.

736
2977
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:15,690
I guess there isn't much to marriage, after all. It's just the same as part-time work.

737
2981
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,850
An exchange between labor and capital.

738
2985
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,390
Are you very mad, Ma'am?

739
2989
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,090
Never mind. It's not like this is the first time.

740
2993
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:48,900
I'm sorry. My know-it-all disease came back again.

741
2997
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,100
Don't kneel, it doesn't look good.

742
3001
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:58,160
I'm already upset as it is. Why go to someone else's company just to get beat up?

743
3005
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,830
These people, they really are ridiculous.

744
3009
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:07,140
What is it to them if someone makes an alarm app or a gong app?

745
3013
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:10,260
Rang.

746
3017
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,320
Why do you want to marry me?

747
3021
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,000
- What?
 - The truth is, come on.

748
3026
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,350
I can't even get an investor and have been like this for the last 3 years.

749
3030
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:27,820
I don't have money, car or a house. I don't have anything.

750
3034
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,870
So why do you want to marry me?

751
3038
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:34,130
What are you saying? I want to do it because it's you.

752
3042
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:40,180
- Because it's me?
 - That's right. Because it's you, Sim Won Seok. So I want to.

753
3047
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,410
Do I need another reason?

754
3051
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,460
<i>Landlord</i>

755
3055
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,710
<i>It's because it's that person.</i>

756
3059
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,600
Because it's him, that's why I married him.

757
3063
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,930
His house or his job,

758
3067
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:35,370
though I can't say those weren't contributing factors.

759
3071
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:39,190
But even with those same conditions,

760
3075
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:43,890
if it had not been him, I wouldn't have married.

761
3079
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,690
So don't say it like that.

762
3083
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:52,400
Marriage may not be so great,

763
3087
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,330
but still, to hear a stranger speak of it that way,

764
3091
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,650
it's not that insignificant.

765
3095
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,670
So I am a stranger, to you, Noona.

766
3099
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,980
So...

767
3103
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:16,710
if something happens here, do you think your husband would come and get you?

768
3107
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:21,130
- What?
 - No, even if you think of him that way,

769
3112
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:24,730
your husband goes to pick up his cat and tells you to ride the bus.

770
3116
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,660
He doesn't care about you.

771
3120
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,300
Hey.

772
3124
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,600
Why are you dissing him so much?

773
3128
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:37,760
Why aren't you answering? I guess you are not confident that he will come and get you?

774
3132
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:42,880
Yeah. I'm not confident. Satisfied?

775
3136
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,460
That's why. Who told you to marry a fake husband?

776
3140
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:52,660
What?

777
3144
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,030
I drank all my beer.

778
3148
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,770
Do you want another one?

779
3152
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:03,760
What did you just...

780
3156
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,470
Why are you so startled?

781
3160
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,060
Did you think I didn't know?

782
3164
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:17,030
I am interested in you much more than you think, so I am not a <i>stranger.</i>

783
3168
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,790
Let's go and watch soccer.

784
3172
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,360
What are you doing now?

785
3176
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,930
Let go!

786
3180
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,430
What if I don't let go? Will you hit me?

787
3184
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:27,990
No. I don't hit people.

788
3188
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:29,980
It costs a lot of money.

789
3192
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:44,860
I researched this earlier. Yes, it's expensive.

790
3196
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:49,030
I will pay for it along with my house loan until 2048.

791
3200
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,820
My motorcycle!

792
3204
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,330
Hurry and come.

793
3208
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,590
So that we can go to our home.

794
3212
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,990
<i>Without effort</i>

795
3216
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,360
<i>we won't be able to understand each other.</i>

796
3220
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:44,090
<i>In such a world...</i>

797
3224
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,810
<i>this thing called love...</i>

798
3228
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,000
<i>exists.</i>

799
3232
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:08,200
♫ <i>Even if I don't want love</i> ♫

800
3236
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,490
♫ <i>When you're before me</i> ♫

801
3240
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:16,720
♫ <i>Oh, I want to hold your hands and everything's fine.</i> ♫

802
3244
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,900
♫ <i>And it makes me want to love.</i> ♫

803

<i>Timing and Subtitles Brought to You by the Scrimp & Scrape Team @ Viki!</i>

804
3252
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,070
<i>You were at home. But why call?</i>

805
3256
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:32,020
<i>Because you are a trustworthy person, that's why I did it.</i>

806
3260
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,450
<i>You think they know about our contract?</i>

807
3264
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,290
<i>So why did you have to save me as "Landlord" on your phone?</i>

808
3268
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:40,890
<i>He just doesn't say it, but I guess he cherishes his wife a lot?</i>

809
3272
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:45,170
<i>In front of others, call me "Husband," please.</i>

810
3276
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:47,130
<i>Why are you looking at me with those eyes?</i>

811
3280
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:50,190
<i>That... how... ?</i>

812
3284
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,460
<i>Get yourself together! Erase it! You must!</i>

813
3288
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:55,030
<i>What's wrong?</i>

814
3292
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,160
<i>Your nails have dirt on them, so dirty.</i>

815
3296
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,860
<i>Look properly! What dirt... ?</i>

816
3300
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,600
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

817
3304
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,260
<i>I... have a person that I like. My husband.</i>
