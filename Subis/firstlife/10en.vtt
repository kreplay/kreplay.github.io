Hello.

13
53
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,200
Hi.

14
57
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,620
I'm Yang Ho Rang. We were in the same class in middle school. In second year.

15
61
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,440
Yeah. I know.

16
65
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,420
Actually, I wanted to be in the same class as you.

17
69
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,570
You got the highest scores in our whole grade.

18
73
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,200
Starting today I'll be your desk partner. Help me out so I can get my grades up, so I could be admitted to a university in Seoul, okay?

19
77
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,800
But, how come

20
81
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,950
you speak in Seoul dialect?

21
85
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,330
What?

22
89
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,670
I transferred here from Seoul. You didn't know?

23
93
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,860
I know, but didn't you come when you were in kindergarten?

24
97
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,980
Hey, teacher! Teacher's here.

25
101
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,060
Look here, you girls, let's get our wits together here.

26
105
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,660
You guys are 18 now, okay? Juniors!

27
109
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,210
And as you can see, we've got a transfer student. Woo Soo Ji.

28
113
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,430
She just transferred today from Jinju. Say hi.

29
117
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,210
That's the end?

30
121
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,050
Yes.

31
125
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,430
Go and sit in that empty seat.

32
129
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,010
What the heck? Is she a volleyball player?

33
133
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,560
Make sure to get your parent's signature on your report cards.

34
137
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,210
Oh no!

35
141
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,070
Ji Ho, you are first in our grade again, of course?

36
145
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,970
<i>2 out of 147</i>

37
149
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,890
You're second?

38
153
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,370
If you're second, then who's first?

39
157
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,570
Wow, she's ranked first.

40
161
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,340
What? Is this true?

41
165
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,130
- Soo Ji, teach us how to study. 
 - Me, too.

42
170
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,180
- Teach me, too. 
 - Get in line, I asked her first.

43
175
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,260
Why get in line? Let's all do it together.

44
179
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,980
Wow, that volleyball is ranked first in our grade?

45
183
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,000
She only looks like she'd be good in volleyball. How can she be first in our grade?

46
187
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,260
Looks like she always ranked first back in Jinju, too.

47
191
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,770
Hey, do you know why Volleyball transferred here to Namhae?

48
195
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,440
I don't know. Why?

49
199
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,490
Her mom ran a fancy restaurant in Jinju, but with a married man...

50
203
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,880
I hear that she doesn't even have a dad.

51
207
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,800
Or she has one, but she doesn't know who he is, some people say.

52
211
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,600
Don't say such things to anyone, okay?

53
215
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,980
Of course not. Why would I?

54
219
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,870
Aish, look at these stars.

55
223
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,090
So many, like a pack of dogs.

56
227
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,880
This place sucks. Out in the boonies.

57
231
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,610
What's your problem?

58
235
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,010
Do you want to die?

59
239
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,050
No, why would I?

60
243
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,310
What's wrong?

61
247
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,200
I heard that you said my mom had a fancy restaurant?

62
251
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,750
That's just what I heard.

63
255
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,580
Oh, really?

64
259
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,610
So saying my mom had an affair with a married man and ran away here? You just heard that, too?

65
263
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,580
Let's go. Let's see who wins.

66
267
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,330
Let go of her and talk.

67
271
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,450
Jinju, let me go!

68
275
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,710
Hey, let go!

69
279
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,860
I was boasting so much that the first and second ranked students were both in my class.

70
283
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,010
This is so embarrassing. Come to your senses already.

71
287
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,910
Oh, what happened, Ji Ho?

72
291
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,250
Hey, you're the one who picked the fight, huh?

73
295
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,290
Look at this mess. Aigoo!

74
299
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,900
Can't you do better?

75
303
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,000
Hey, aiyoo.

76
307
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,220
Why were they only hitting me? Why only me?!?

77
311
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,100
So I don't study well. Does that mean I'm not human?

78
315
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,820
What's so great about you two?

79
319
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,570
You guys look like stuffed pancakes!

80
323
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,110
You ugly girls!

81
327
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,830
Ho Rang, don't cry.

82
331
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,580
What's with that?

83
335
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,020
You're great at the local dialect.

84
339
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,930
If you think it's so unfair, then do better studying.

85
343
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,960
If I could be good at studying just by wanting to do it,

86
347
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,900
then I would be already good at it!

87
351
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,150
What is she saying?

88
355
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,710
Stop acting like you're so great! It's obnoxious!

89
359
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,910
Yang Ho Rang, I heard you came to my house?

90
363
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,370
What is this pathetic thing?

91
367
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,800
Huh?

92
371
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,030
Thanks for the apples. (apple = sa-gwa, is an homonym for apology)

93
375
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,410
The ones I circled in red, solve those problems three times.

94
379
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,590
Those will be in the mid term exams.

95
383
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,760
By the way, stop using Seoul dialect in front of me.

96
387
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,530
It's obnoxious.

97
391
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,510
You're ridiculous, really.

98
395
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,540
<i>And just like that, we became friends.</i>

99
399
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,320
Look at this. I got a 70 on the math test.

100
403
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,310
How's that?

101
407
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,130
- Is that right? Your scores went up by a lot. 
- You did well.

102
412
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,790
You only got three problems wrong.

103
416
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,200
♫ <i>I smile quietly</i> ♫

104
420
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,600
♫ <i>So no one knows, no one at all</i> ♫

105
424
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,360
<i> Woo Soo and Ji Ho</i>

107
433
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,420
I will get you girls this time! How dare you?

108
437
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,630
- Oh, I got one. I hooked one!
 - What is it?

109
442
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,250
- I got one!
 - What is it?

110
447
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,250
Wow, it's huge! A Black Porgy!

111
451
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,380
Wow!

112
455
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,540
I'm going to be president of my own company.

113
459
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,170
You study so well, why would you become a merchant?

114
463
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,520
Become a professor, or go work at a huge conglomerate and become a career woman.

115
467
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,230
Hey, I could do that for 100 years, but I'd still be nothing but a wage-worker.

116
471
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,600
We only live once. Why spend it working under someone else?

117
475
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
I want plenty of money, to my heart's content.

118
479
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,290
Of course, with that personality, how could you work for anyone else?

119
483
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:11,770
I want to marry a self-made rich man and become a homemaker.

120
487
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,670
A self-made rich man?

121
491
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,250
Why? Why not just marry a rich man?

122
495
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,550
No way. If he inherits the wealth, I will have to be a slave to my in-laws. It's part of the price.

123
499
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,200
But if a man is a self-made success, then it all becomes ours.

124
503
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,390
Then among us, there will be a madam with a "-sa?"

125
507
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,540
Doctor or lawyer's wife? (eui-SA = doctor, byeon-ho-SA = lawyer)

126
511
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,350
These days, the trend is engineering. An engineering major turned venture capitalist.

127
515
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,620
That is the perfect self-made rich man I'm dreaming of.

128
519
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,780
What about you, Ji Ho?

129
523
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,910
It's obvious. Becoming a writer, right?

130
527
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,050
No.

131
531
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,380
Then, what is it?

132
535
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,600
It's true that I want to become a writer because I like to write, but

133
539
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,560
that isn't my dream.

134
543
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,730
My dream

135
547
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,220
- is love. 
 - Love?

136
552
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,030
What kind of dream is love?

137
556
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,850
Min Kook who lives next door to you, he likes you. Go date him.

138
560
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,800
No, he's ugly. Date Seung Won instead.

139
564
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,310
No, I don't mean that sort of thing.

140
568
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,460
That once-in-a-lifetime love.

141
572
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,350
Meeting a man who is my fate,

142
576
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,990
that is my dream.

143
580
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,770
<i> I have someone I like.</i>

144
584
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,930
<i> What are you saying?</i>

145
588
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,230
<i> What? Who?</i>

146
592
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,830
<i> My husband.</i>

147
596
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,460
<i> Hey, are you joking around?</i>

148
600
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,090
<i>What's with you, Ji Ho? Are you rubbing it in?</i>

149
604
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,740
<i> Then, I'm going to confess my love for Won Seok here.</i>

150
608
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,250
<i> You guys... Just sleep!</i>

151
612
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,810
♫ <i>please be a shelter for my tired soul</i> ♫

152
616
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,290
<i>Actually what marriage really is,</i>

153
620
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,600
<i>I'm still not sure.</i>

154
624

Is Kitty better?

168
680
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,490
Yes. I think it's like the clinic said, just temporary.

169

What?

170

This is pickled deodeok roots, and this is braised mackerel.

183
741
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,520
He really loves braised fish.

184
745
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,940
I see.

185
749
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,740
What brings you here without even calling first.

186
753
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,860
It's my son's home. Why would I call first?

187
757
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,080
I came because I thought you guys would be home for sure since it's the weekend.

188
761
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,500
Let's put these in the fridge.

189
765
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,920
Oh, yes.

190
769
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,000
Let me do it.

191
773
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,150
It's alright. Like you know anything about kitchen stuff.

192
777
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,920
Homemaking is done by the experts.

193
781
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,500
Right, Ji Ho?

194
785
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes.

195
789
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,450
- This. 
- Yes, give to me, please.

196
794
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,390
You remember Vice Principal Hwang, right? He sent a box of apples.

197
798
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,390
I tried them with your father-in-law and they're so delicious.

198
802
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,090
Yes.

199
806
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,790
Does our daughter-in-law like apples too?

200
810
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,410
Yes, I like them.

201
814
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,820
Well, actually, I'm not picky about any food.

202
818
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,600
That's great.

203
822
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,930
Let me take it, plea--

204
826
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,730
Give to me. I'll do it.

205
830
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,130
I hear our Ji Ho works at a cafe?

206
834
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,580
Yes. I thought I should do some work.

207
838
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,860
In case it's hard for Oppa to have to do all the work?

208
842
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,140
Oh, you're so lovely.

209
846
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,970
Where did he find such a nice girl to bring home?

210
850
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,250
You know tomorrow's the memorial, right?

211
854
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,260
- If you get off work early--
 - I don't get off early.

212
859
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,720
And did I ever go to the memorial before? Why suddenly--

213
863
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,810
Alright. I know you're busy.

214
867
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,100
I mean, if you have time, try to come, that's all I'm saying.

215
871
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,270
Let me have that.

216
875
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,360
Like you're really going to peel an apple.

217
879
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,920
This is also for people who have experience doing it.

218
883
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Right?

219
887
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,450
Yes.

220
891
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,980
Please give it to me. I'll do it.

221
895
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,100
Will you?

222
899
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,630
<i>Ji Ho, we're here already. When are you coming? </i>

223
903
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,160
You said you had an appointment, right? With your friends.

224
907
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,610
Oh.

225
911
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes.

226
915
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,750
Go on. Hurry before you're late.

227
919
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,700
Is that right? You should hurry and go.

228
923
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,420
Then.

229
927
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,230
I'll peel it, I suppose.

230
931
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,380
So so sorry.

231
935
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,090
- You're here. 
- You waited a long time, huh?

232
940
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,640
Nope. It's fine.

233
944
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,580
My mother-in-law came over suddenly.

234
948
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,890
It's alright, I said.

235
952
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,060
Oh, why do I have this sudden headache?

236
956
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,670
Your head hurts? Suddenly, why?

237
960
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
What's the ring for?

238
964
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,150
Won Seok gave it to you?

239
968
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,390
Getting married?

240
972
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,870
Yes, Ji Ho! I'm getting married!

241
976
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,810
Ah! I'm getting married.

242
980
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,590
- What do we do? 
- Ji Ho, I'm getting married.

243
985
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,040
You're not going to make a trip home?

244
989
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,710
We'll see.

245
993
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:27,700
Your father says he will pay off your mortgage.

246
997
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,620
No, thanks.

247
1001
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,670
How long are you going to keep that up with your father?

248
1005
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,360
You're married now too, and it's time you bury it and forget it.

249
1009
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,700
Bury it and forget it?

250
1013
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,330
About what? Bury what and forget what?

251
1017
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,020
And what's this marriage got to do with Father?

252
1021
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,640
Se Hee. Your father's very sorry too.

253
1025
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,830
Your father's getting old too now.

254
1029
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,120
Please go. I have things to do.

255
1033
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,240
And please don't come like this again without calling first.

256
1037
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,140
It's not proper courtesy to the person I live with.

257
1041
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,960
And go home in a cab.

258
1045
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,310
A person he lives with?

259
1049
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,690
He's talking about his wife like she's some tenant.

260
1053
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,060
So, I said, "Where the heck is dirt on my nails?"

261
1057
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,320
I looked at my hand and instead of dirt, I see this! Ta-da!

262
1061
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,990
Wow, I guess you grind Won Seok (raw stone) enough, you can turn it into a jewel too.

263
1065
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,190
I guess you finally got rewarded for the work you put in for seven years, Yang Ho Rang.

264
1069
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:45,820
Yeah, even seven years ago, Won Seok would buy her a flashlight if she said the road home was scary at night.

265
1073
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,760
What did I say? I would make my Won Seok a 'Mark Jukebox.' (Mark Zuckerberg)

266
1077
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,740
He's working at Brother-in-law's company now so all that's left is all the good things to come.

267
1081
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,400
Hey, it's not Mark Jukebox. It's Mark--

268
1085
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,980
But what do you mean your mother-in-law came suddenly? Why?

269
1089
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,990
She came to drop off food.

270
1093
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,800
To the newlywed's home on a weekend morning?

271
1097
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,740
Huh? Yeah.

272
1101
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,580
Hey, it's not like she pressed the security code and went, 'surprise,' right?

273
1105
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,580
Can't be.

274
1109
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,660
Ji Ho, now your life in the "sea" (in-law's) world is starting, too?

275
1113
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,000
She just came to the home once.

276
1117
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,690
Yeah, from the mother-in-law's perspective, it could be a given.

277
1121
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,080
It's the home her son bought so of course she's got the right to come and go, too.

278
1125
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,990
Hey! Why does she have any right to the home her son bought?

279
1129
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,080
Once he's an adult and on his own, he's independent.

280
1133
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,500
If there's any right to speak of, that should belong to the partner that the son himself chooses.

281
1137
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,160
Yeah, that's right.

282
1141
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,360
But that's true for 'Tom' or 'James,' Unni, and we're not in America.

283
1145
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,460
To a Korean mother, a home paid for all with her son's money, would she think Ji Ho has any rights?

284
1149
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,090
It's not like Ji Ho pays rent to live there.

285
1153
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,230
Right? If the wife paid rent, then I guess she couldn't barge in.

286
1157
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,850
Rent?

287
1161
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,080
Hey, you are too much.

288
1165
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,880
And that mother-in-law. She's not someone so scary.

289
1169
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,020
She's nice to me too.

290
1173
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:21,170
So I am nice to her too and I want to look favorable to her too.

291
1177
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,620
We've got another newbie daughter-in-law about to get the disease here.

292
1181
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,660
- What disease? 
- 'Good daughter-in-law' disease.

293
1186
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,350
Was it because of this?

294
1190
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,920
Just trim like your usual style?

295
1194
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,790
Yes.

296
1198
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,560
But do I look strange somewhere?

297
1202
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,650
Where?

298
1206
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,110
Nope. You look the same.

1210
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,990
This discount coupon. Can it still be used?

300
1214
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,490
Yes.

301
1218
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,730
<i> 'Good daughter-in-law' disease?</i>

302
1222
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,980
<i>The disease that newbie daughter-in-laws tend to get easily after they are married.</i>

303
1226
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,420
<i>The disease that gets them to overwork for the sake of looking like a good and well-mannered daughter-in-law.</i>

304
1230
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,200
<i>But I get it.</i>

305
1234
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,160
<i>A bride would want to look lovable to the husband and to his family. </i>

306
1238
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,480
<i>Lots of people get that disease after they get married. That good daughter-in-law disease.</i>

307
1242
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:52,460
<i>Do I have early onset 'good daughter-in-law' disease? How come I just can't say no to my in-laws?</i>

308
1246
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,230
That's not it.

309
1250
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,130
Why can't she say no? I would just...

310
1254
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:14,470
<i>It's that man, who I can't say no to.</i>

311
1258
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:26,020
♫ <i>So in love. I feel like I am not myself</i> ♫

312
1262
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,150
♫ <i>When we are together</i> ♫

313
1266
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,500
You changed your hairstyle.

314
1270
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,840
Oh, yes.

315
1274
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,440
It was bothering me for this and that reason.

316
1278
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,630
Does it look strange?

317
1282
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,770
No, I like it.

318
1286
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,520
Your hair.

319
1290
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,210
I like your hairstyle.

320
1294
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,480
Yes.

321
1298
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:05,320
♫ <i>I'm in love in love in love with you. Every day. </i> ♫

322
1302
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,240
Your mother left safely?

323
1306
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,660
Yes.

324
1310
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,780
I'm really sorry about my mother.

325
1314
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,940
I already told her firmly, many times.

326
1318
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,980
It's alright. It's just a parent coming to her child's home.

327
1322
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,100
No. That's still not okay. Suddenly, like that.

328
1326
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,210
I think it's best I change the security code.

329
1330
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,020
You don't have to go that far.

330
1334
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,090
If it's because of me, I'm okay.

331
1338
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,970
I'm the one who's not okay.

332
1342
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,030
Oh, okay.

333
1346
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,470
<i>It's complete.</i>

334
1350
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,910
<i>Just know that I am taking it easy on you because your fake husband was dashing. To think I'd fall for those words!</i>

335
1354
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,020
<i>You got yourself a good landlord, Noona.</i>

336
1358
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,590
<i>What words? </i>

337
1362
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,610
<i>I asked him when he came to settle the side mirror cost, why he married you. </i>

338
1366
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,090
<i> And? What did he say?</i>

339
1370
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,600
<i>What else? He said to get monthly rent.</i>

340
1374
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,470
<i>And he said he respected you. </i>

341
1378
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,320
<i>He said what?</i>

342
1382
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,240
<i>He said he respected you as a defender.</i>

343
1386
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,920
<i>I'm what...?</i>

344
1390
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,710
<i>Respects me as a defender?</i>

345
1394
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,030
<i>It gets deflected by the defense and the ball is kicked off.</i>

346
1398
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,760
<i>That was a great chance for Arsenal.</i>

347
1402
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,980
Respect me as a defender?

348
1406
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,220
What does that mean?

349
1410
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,680
Is it a re-broadcast?

350
1414
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,560
Yes. I think so.

351
1418
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:21,520
<i>It's on the left. Rose is going in. Koscielny on the low.  </i>

352
1422
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,270
<i>Arsenal deflects.</i>

353
1426
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,710
Arsenal's iron wall is Koscielny indeed, right?

354
1430
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,210
Yes. He's an excellent defender.

355
1434
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:39,070
Then, since it's the weekend, I'll make a trip to the market.

356
1438
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,300
I'll come too.

357
1442
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,690
I need to get some groceries too.

358
1446
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,800
Yes. Sure.

359
1450
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:58,220
I am curious about something.

360
1454
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,310
I heard from Bok Nam

361
1458
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:07,280
that you respected me as a defender, he said.

362
1462
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,880
Oh. Yes.

363
1466
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,540
He asked me why I married you.

364
1470
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,820
What does that mean? May I ask you that?

365
1474
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,340
Well, just as the words mean.

366
1478
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,650
You were the first tenant I respected.

367
1482
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,160
You never missed recycling day, even once.

368
1486
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,300
And of course, you never missed giving Kitty food.

369
1490
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,520
And more than anything, no matter the circumstance,

370
1494
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,790
you are someone who knows how to play proper defense.

371
1498
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,590
<i>Shall I flip this over then?!</i>

372
1502
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,030
<i>Oppa. </i>

373
1506
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,630
<i>I love him.</i>

374
1510
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,140
So that was the meaning of me as a defender?

375
1514
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,630
Since marriage isn't an issue for just two people.

376
1518
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:11,920
It's a system where the surrounding interests are more important than the feelings of the two.

377
1522
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,410
Even this morning, you defended my mother perfectly.

378
1526
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,080
So we were able to get through it well, I think.

379
1530
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,810
I am getting a lot of benefits, due to you.

380
1534
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,040
I am grateful.

381
1538
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:31,990
I need to go buy Kitty's snacks.

382
1542
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,510
Yes. I need to buy rice.

383
1546
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,050
Yes.

384
1550
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,130
<i>Ji Ho, do you know what Brother-in-law's nickname at work is?</i>

385
1554
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,700
<i>Nope. What is it? </i>

386
1558
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,160
<i>Mortgage-Left, Kitty-Right. Since Brother-in-law's left brain is filled only with the loan, and his right brain is filled only with his cat.</i>

387
1562
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,610
<i>Really? </i>

388
1566
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,850
<i>Hey, is this something to laugh about?</i>

389
1570
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,400
<i>Then where are you? </i>

390
1574
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,130
<i>I mean, if he's only got the loan on his left brain and the cat in his right brain, where in his brain are you?</i>

391
1578
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,200
<i>Well I guess--</i>

392
1582
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,650
<i>Oh. His heart? </i>

393
1586
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,790
<i>Thank you. </i>

394
1590
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,130
<i>I know that it cannot be.</i>

395
1594
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,210
<i>That in that man's heart</i>

396
1598
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,590
<i>I am not there. I know that.</i>

397
1602
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,080
<i>Oh, I didn't enter my rewards card information.</i>

398
1606
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,760
<i>Yes, I'll help you enter it.</i>

399
1610
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,380
<i>I am just</i>

400
1614
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,030
<i>a stable tenant that guarantees a monthly income.</i>

401
1618
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:59,420
<i>I am just</i>

402
1622
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,370
<i>an excellent defender who can maintain his anti-marriage.</i>

403
1626
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,110
<i>In this man's heart,</i>

404
1630
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,720
<i>what exists there?</i>

405
1634
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:29,500
Um. Se Hee.

406
1638
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,370
Do you have a dream?

407
1642
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,950
What?

408
1646
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,960
I mean, like a goal in life?

409
1650
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,080
Goal?

410
1654
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,840
I...

411
1658
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:56,420
I just want nothing to happen in my life.

412
1662
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,850
What?

413
1666
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,540
Nothing?

414
1670
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,030
Yes.

415
1674
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,430
I would like every day to be the same, just like this.

416
1678
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,840
Go to work and pay back the loan.

417
1682
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,140
Get off work and watch soccer while drinking beer and fall sleep.

418
1686
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,840
That's your dream?

419
1690
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,320
Yes.

420
1694
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:24,570
Living like that and dying in my home is my goal.

421
1698
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,100
Dream...

422
1702
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,750
I suppose that is my dream.

423
1706
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:45,100
<i>A road into that man's heart.</i>

424
1710
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,740
<i>Does it actually exist? </i>

425
1714
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,780
Why the tie, too? It's casual attire there. I don't need to dress like this.

426
1718
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,730
Still. It's your first day at work so you should do this much. Don't you know the first impression is everything?

427
1722
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,500
Now, it's done.

428
1726
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,260
But you know, Sang Won quit being my facebook friend.

429
1730
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,950
Oh, he did?

430
1734
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,690
By chance, did the Wake Alarm app not end on good terms?

431
1738
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,250
No, it was settled nicely.

432
1742
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,120
Really?

433
1746
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,030
Of course. Sang Won and the boys even told me congrats, for getting the job.

434
1750
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,720
Really?

435
1754
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:36,630
With our Seok dressed like this, he really looks like Mark Jukebox.

436
1758
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,760
Rang.

437
1762
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,810
Are you happy?

438
1766
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:43,730
Yeah, very very happy.

439
1770
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,170
That's all that matters then, if you're happy.

440
1774
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,530
- I'm going to work. 
- Bye. Have a good day at work.

441
1779
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,830
I need you do that for me. The peck.

442
1783
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,010
- Bye. 
- Bye.

443
1788
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,550
So I don't need to sell the company?

444
1792
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,860
So we're dating now?

445
1796
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,380
Sure, let's do it.

446
1800
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,780
If you keep a few conditions.

447
1804
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,020
Conditions?

448
1808
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,440
<i>Dating Contract</i>

449
1812
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,960
What is this?

450
1816
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,330
Keep our relationship a secret.

451
1820
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,780
This. Is this sane?

452
1824
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,470
What is this, really?

453
1828
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,690
What else? A contract

454
1832
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,360
for our dating.

455
1836
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,160
We're going to make a contract? On what?

456
1840
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,440
Our dating?

457
1844
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,040
Okay. I've got the diagnosis.

458
1848
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,330
So my Soo Ji has watched too many dramas, that's why. What this contract dating is, you see,

459
1852
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:13,490
this is something done by those next generation chaebeols with nothing else to do or those Hallyu stars.

460
1856
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,820
Why would we do contract dating when we are just regular salary-earners?

461
1860
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,700
It's because it's us. That's why we need a contract all the more.

462
1864
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,960
People like us, who don't have a lot of time

463
1868
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,940
from working so hard, shouldn't we use our time and energy resourcefully?

464
1872
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,420
That's right, that is correct. However,

465
1876
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:33,210
dating is not some kind of business to write a contract about.

466
1880
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,200
So? You don't want to?

467
1884
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,730
What? Who said I didn't want to?

468
1888
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,910
Right, then look. First,

469
1892
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,440
we only meet outside our homes, be it weekends or weekdays.
 - I'm okay with that.

470
1897
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,730
I also like going out. And in order to get some vitamin D, sunlight is the best thing.

471
1901
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,220
Second, we should never ask about each other's personal lives.

472
1905
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,100
Personal lives? How could we not ask?

473
1909
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,420
Us dating is personal life in itself.

474
1913
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:06,270
Well... Just because we are dating, sharing trivial information and being nosy,

475
1917
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,930
I think it's a a form of violence.

476
1921
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,050
Don't you think so?

477
1925
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,190
Just... If you don't want to date me then say so!

478
1929
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,560
Why do you keep on beating around the bush? Darn it. Aigoo.

479
1933
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,200
No... I like you, CEO Ma. I want to date you.

480
1937
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,540
That's why I'm talking about this.

481
1941
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,690
My usual rule is to not sleep with guys I work with.

482
1945
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,870
So to even consider dating you, it is a big deal for me.

483
1949
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,890
Oh, is that so?

484
1953
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:44,020
No. I understand now, about everything.

485
1957
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,210
But considering this is between lovers, this contract lacks affection.

486
1961
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:52,000
The last item, if we meet once...

487
1965
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,150
we do it twice.

488
1969
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:01,050
Hey, this is a contract overflowing with affection, after all.

489
1973
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:06,520
Twice? Three times? Four times? I can do it. I can do it all.

490
1977
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,770
And we should renegotiate the contract every 100 days.

491
1981
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,480
- Why every 100 days?
 - Why?

492
1986
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,770
Is it hard?

493
1990
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,020
<i>Dating Contract</i>

494
1994
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,750
She's totally bad. She's a wild fox (vixen).

495
1998
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,910
Right. If we came this far then that's it. Let's end it here.

496
2002
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:55,190
Ma Sang Goo, your mother always warned you. You should never date a bad woman.

497
2006
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,470
Before I sink lower than this, it ends here. Stop.

498
2010
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,390
<i>Can I kiss you?</i>

499
2014
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,430
What am I doing now? Is there a lag my right brain?

500
2018
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,040
Erase it! Erase!

501
2022
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,150
Erase. Delete. I should delete it.

502
2026
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:29,060
<i>And the last item, when we meet once, we do it twice.</i>

503
2030
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:36,260
Ma Sang Goo! Is your mind controlled by your body? What is wrong with you?

504
2034
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,100
Get yourself together! She's bad! Ouch! I hit myself too hard!

505
2038
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,070
- Hello.
<i>These days, the world is a scary place. Get a grip.</i>

506
2043
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,010
No! But still no! You can't!

507
2047
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,990
Oh, my goodness? Why...?

508
2051
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,520
What's wrong with him?

509
2055
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
I wouldn't know.

510
2059
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,950
Coming to this company, are you sure you will be okay?

511
2063
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,690
<i>This can't be happening unless my brain has left my body! Get yourself together Ma Sang Goo!</i>

512
2067
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:06,720
You should listen to your mom! Oh, shut the... ugh!

513
2071
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,140
This is the meeting room and that is the CEO's room.

514
2075
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,150
And that is the employee's break area.

515
2079
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,680
- Yes.
 - And this...

516
2084
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,010
is Won Seok-nim's work desk.

517
2088
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,610
Yes.

518
2092
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,250
Then, Hyungnim are you going to be my supervisor?

519
2096
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:31,600
No. First, it's not hyungnim but Se Hee-nim.

520
2100
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,920
Ahhh. Yes.

521
2104
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,090
And your supervisor will be

522
2108
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,910
that person.

523
2112
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,950
Your supervisor will be

524
2116
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,760
that person.

525
2120
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,600
First, your desk has been set-up with the basics.

526
2124
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,330
But that thing is missing.

527
2128
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,970
Perhaps, do you have a test earphone you have been using?

528
2132
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,030
- Yes.
 - Then do you have the mechanical keyboard too?

529
2137
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,550
Yes. I also have one.

530
2141
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,830
- Then what about a girlfriend?
 - Pardon?

531
2146
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,770
Yeah, I do have a girlfriend too.

532
2150
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:25,600
Oh, so you have one. How long have you been using Slack?

533
2154
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,060
Slack, I used that since it was launched. So for about four years?

534
2158
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,500
Then how long have you been with your girlfriend?

535
2162
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,700
I have been dating her for 7 years.

536
2166
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,130
No, but why do you keep on asking those things?

537
2170
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,990
It's necessary for our business, that's why.

538
2174
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:44,810
If you have anything you are curious about then ask me right away. Then...

539
2178
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,430
Delete. But wait.

540
2182
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,940
Do I have indigestion?

541
2186
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,180
So refreshing.

542
2190
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,830
Won Seok, can you see me for a bit?

543
2194
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,360
Yes.

544
2198
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,640
Who was that? Woo Ji Soo? Oh Soo Soo? Who was it?

545
2202
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,520
- Soo Ji? 
- Ah, Soo Ji.

546
2207
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,300
- So her name was Soo Ji. Did you say you were college friends?
 - Yes.

547
2212
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,170
The truth is, I met Rang because of Soo Ji and Ji Ho.

548
2216
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,900
Rang came to our school more than her own school, to see them.

549
2220
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,210
Ah, so that's how it was.

550
2224
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:03,330
Was she popular back in school and such?

551
2228
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,670
- Well, there were a lot of guys who made a move on her.
 - Is that so?

552
2233
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,260
What about you? Didn't you?

553
2237
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,830
What? Me?

554
2241
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,230
How can you put me with her? No way.

555
2245
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,000
Why not? You are college friends

556
2249
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,990
and you met her before your girlfriend. I saw her and she's kind of pretty and looks cool.

557
2253
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:25,800
She is. But I can't tame a scary program like her.

558
2257
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,500
She's not a source code that a dummy nerd like me can handle.

559
2261
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,590
She's on a different level.

560
2265
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,330
Then, what about me? Will I do? Will we match?

561
2269
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,700
Hyung and Soo Ji?

562
2273
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,530
It would be like being hit with ransomware (malicious software), shall I say?

563
2277
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:48,160
Total "unrecoverable application error," and a feeling like your life will be ruined.

564
2281
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,520
Thanks. Go ahead and work.

565
2285
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,230
My life will be ruined?

566
2289
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,890
Excuse me.

567
2293
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,440
Yes, Ma'am.

568
2297
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,200
This one. It's too bland. It doesn't taste like anything.

569
2301
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,180
Can I give it a try?

570
2305
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,380
I think it's okay.

571
2309
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,800
I think you don't understand what I'm saying.

572
2313
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,690
How am I supposed to eat this? I said it's not tasty to me.

573
2317
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:56,140
Huh? So either make me a new one or give me a refund.

574
2321
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,400
I can do that, Ma'am.

575
2325
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,870
But I think you eat food that is too salty.

576
2329
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:08,620
What? No, who do you think you are? Blabbering like that?

577
2333
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,740
Manager Yang, what kind of attitude is that towards a customer?

578
2337
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,590
- I'm sorry.
 - You usually don't do this. What happened?

579
2342
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,310
Is it that time of the month?

580
2346
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,410
- Manager.
 - What?

581
2351
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,100
I really wanted to tell you this.

582
2355
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:33,090
Why do you always ask if it's that time of the month and diss my innocent uterus whenever something goes wrong?

583
2359
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,830
- What?
 - Well,

584
2364
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:41,830
I was the one who did wrong and not my uterus. And that goes for all the other girls, too.

585
2368
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,370
Manager Yang, did you drink in broad daylight?

586
2372
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:51,300
No. I didn't and my period has ended, too.

587
2376
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:56,010
Break time is almost over so I will go and rest for a bit.

588
2380
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,700
Aigoo.

589
2384
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,660
Manager, why did you do that?

590
2388
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,400
What if you get fired?

591
2392
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,060
It's okay. I will quit before I get fired.

592
2396
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,430
What? Are you perhaps going somewhere?

593
2400
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,400
Yeah. I will go to a new place one of these days.

594
2404
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,830
Really? Where?

595
2408
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,530
- Hyeon-Mo-Yang-Chuh (good wife and wise mother).
 - Hyeon-Mo-Yang-Chuh ?

596
2413
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:36,800
Ahh, you are moving to some traditional Korean cuisine restaurant?

597
2417
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,200
Rang, I'm here.

598
2421
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,290
Oh my, you're here Honey? Give it to me.

599
2425
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,690
Huh?

600
2429
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,490
What was that? It's weird.

601
2433
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,980
What's weird about it? We have to practice it now so that it won't be awkward when we're married.

602
2437
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,240
What's all of this?

603
2441
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,280
I took half a day off and went to the wedding fair.

604
2445
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,290
Getting ready for the wedding, booking a venue, and wedding photoshoot, wedding dress and make up, there is so much to do.

605
2449
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,510
Sit down, I'll explain everything. Come here.

606
2453
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,070
We should register for wedding mileage.

607
2457
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,740
Wedding mileage?

608
2461
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,810
To pay for our wedding attire and gifts, we will spend a bundle, so we should sign up for that.

609
2465
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:28,410
But we have to reserve the wedding hall before they will do it.

610
2469
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,400
A wedding hall?

611
2473
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,630
Then, we have to reserve a wedding hall quickly. Right?

612
2477
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,970
Oh no, the good ones will be booked until next year.

613
2481
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,680
Next year?

614
2485
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:49,950
If not next year, then if we do it the year after that, it's nice to prepare everything early on.

615
2489
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,120
Ho Rang, what do you mean the year after next year?

616
2493
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,240
How could we get married two years from now?

617
2497
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,400
Huh?

618
2501
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,290
<i> The door's open, come in.</i>

619
2505
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,720
What's this reaction?

620
2509
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,600
Is it a rejection?

621
2513
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,870
I bought this while coming here.

622
2517
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:46,480
It's a bling-bling newest model.

623
2521
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,160
Like you.

624
2525
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,360
My phone's fine, though.

625
2529
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,190
Use that for official matters.

626
2533
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:00,050
Use this one only with me. Okay?

627
2537
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:08,170
Okay, I got it. Let's date.

628
2541
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:12,220
I'll listen to all three of your conditions!

629
2545
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,300
Instead, you can't give this number to anyone else.

630
2549
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,020
This phone is for contacting me only.

631
2553
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,730
This is my condition.

632
2557
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,760
As expected, you know how to negotiate.

633
2561
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,720
Did you save your number already?

634
2565
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,280
<i>Oppa Sang Goo♡</i>

635
2569
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,500
This is you.

636
2573
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,170
<i>My baby♡</i>

637
2577
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,770
What's with that laugh?

638
2581
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,570
Sang Goo Oppa,

639
2585
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,460
why aren't you showering already, wasting time?

640
2589
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,570
We have a lot to do.

641
2593
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,820
You punk, I ought to punish you properly today.

642
2597
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,720
As the adult, I will properly educate you! You just wait!

643
2601
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,990
I'll shower and return in 10 minutes, no 5 minutes.

644
2605
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:32,900
Yirgacheffe coffee, two cups.

645
2609
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,500
Okay.

646
2613
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,220
Unrequited love is tough, right?

647
2617
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,600
What?

648
2621
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,720
Unrequited love with your husband must not be easy, Noona.

649
2625
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,050
What are you saying? Who said anything about unrequited love?

650
2629
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,180
Is it obvious?

651
2633
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,720
Of course it is.

652
2637
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,330
Your gaze is different from your husband's.

653
2641
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:07,030
What's mine like, and what's his like?

654
2645
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:13,760
Your gaze says, "I'll do everything for you,"

655
2649
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,530
and your husband's gaze says,

656
2653
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,390
"Whatever."

657
2657
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,170
Good impression of him, right?

658
2661
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:28,190
Don't worry too much. You'll strain and wear yourself out.

659
2665
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:31,890
A heart should be given and taken, not just given away.

660
2669
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,250
Hello?

661
2673
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,600
Oh, yes.

662
2677
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,720
Yes, Mother-in-law.

663
2681
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:17,750
Come in! You had a rough day, right?

664
2685
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,080
No, I'm fine.

665
2689
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,520
I thought that you coming here would be nice so I called you.

666
2693
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,680
If both of you miss this, it's a bit sad.

667
2697
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,480
This is your first ancestral rite after your wedding, after all.

668
2701
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,350
Yeah.

669
2705
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,760
What about Father-in-law?

670
2709
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,140
He'll come soon.

671
2713
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,110
Come in.

672
2717
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,900
This way.

673
2721
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,590
How do you cook all of this by yourself?

674
2725
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:43,940
Oh, I'm an expert.

675
2729
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,400
I've been the wife of the oldest son for 40 years.

676
2733
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,010
Wow, you're amazing.

677
2737
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:54,460
My daughter-in-law is so precious, how can I make her work?

678
2741
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,950
Wow, this has always been a wish of mine,

679
2745
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,810
matching clothes with my daughter.

680
2749
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:05,670
- Daughter? 
 - Of course. My daughter-in-law is like my child. She's my daughter.

681
2754
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:12,190
Having been around curt men until now, I love that you're here, Ji Ho.

682
2758
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,020
What should I start with, Mother-in-law?

683
2762
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,650
Oh, all of this.

684
2766
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:47,350
<i> Have you not left work yet?</i>

685
2770
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,670
<i>I came to your family's ancestral rites.</i>

686
2774
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,720
<i>Like last time.</i>

687
2778
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,630
<i>Seriously. Oppa.</i>

688
2782
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,400
Come back next year for the ancestral rites.

689
2786
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,830
Okay.

690
2790
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,210
Ah, that brother of mine.

691
2794
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,620
Should I give you more apples?

692
2798
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:26,850
Yeah, the apples are really good.

693
2802
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,840
Ah, yes.

694
2806
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,690
Come here, Sang Mi.

695
2810
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:38,050
She really grew, didn't she?

696
2814
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:40,150
Aww.

697
2818
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:44,410
Your hands are really skilled.

698
2822
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:47,260
Sang Mi, watch Aunt carefully.

699
2826
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,260
She graduated from Seoul National University.

700
2830
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,400
You should grow up smart and skilled like her, okay?

701
2834
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,150
Yes.

702
2838
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:58,130
Ah, you speak well.

703
2842
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:03,200
Now it finally feels like I'm at our family home. You always make me do all the work.

704
2846
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,930
Oh Auntie, I never did that.

705
2850
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,330
It's a joke, Unni.

706
2854
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:14,520
If I had sons, I could have fun having a daughter-in-law, like this.

707
2858
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,890
I'm so jealous.

708
2862
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:17,860
<i>Fun?</i>

709
2866
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:23,850
I was so jealous that you have a daughter, but not anymore.

710
2870
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:27,740
I have a daughter-like daughter-in-law.

711
2874
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:32,340
Your mother-in-law must really be happy to have you.

712
2878
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,150
Of course. I got a daughter for free.

713
2882
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,910
Dear, take care of this, too.

714
2886
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:40,410
Yes.

715
2890
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,560
Oh, right. You also have to wash the dishes used for the ancestral rites.

716
2894
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,210
Where did they go? Let's go find them.

717
2898
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,150
Se Hee, how did you get here?

718
2902
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,260
Se Hee, how did you get here?

719
2906
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,940
Oh, Se Hee, I thought I wasn't going to see you today.

720
2910
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:19,390
But how did you get a wife like that?

721
2914
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:21,250
Really.

722
2918
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,280
Let's do this.

723
2922
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:02,240
Father, isn't the food offering more delicious today?

724
2926
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:07,770
Your granddaughter-in-law is very good with her hands.

725
2930
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,610
You should also bow.

726
2934
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:13,170
You should leave now.

727
2938
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:31,720
Be careful of the dishes, Sang Mi.

728
2942
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,750
Get along well.

729
2946
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,160
I'll take care of these.

730
2950
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:50,330
Oh, you're just in the way. Stay out of here.

731
2954
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,400
I will do this.

732
2958
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,320
Yes, I know. Everyone knows you adore her.

733
2962
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,420
I appreciate your willingness to help

734
2966
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,090
but you're just making things complicated, Mister.

735
2970
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:05,680
Yeah, if you do that for Ji Ho, she'll get embarrassed.

736
2974
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,850
- What does that mean...?
 - Please stay outside.

737
2979
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,930
Eat well.

738
2983
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:41,010
There you go.

739
2987
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,070
The house loan,

740
2991
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,200
did you pay it back?

741
2995
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,270
I am paying it back.

742
2999
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:02,400
I'll pay it back the rest for you as I promised.

743
3003
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,970
Why would you pay back my loan?

744
3007
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:07,570
I heard your wife has a part-time job.

745
3011
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,320
That's not something your in-laws would like.

746
3015
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:15,810
And I promised to buy you a home when you married.

747
3019
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,810
A promise.

748
3023
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,620
A promise is between two people.

749
3027
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:26,970
A promise made by one party isn't a promise, it's a notification or a delusion.

750
3031
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:31,350
A father wants to pay for his married son's house.

751
3035
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:34,850
How is that a notification or a delusion?

752
3039
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:39,500
Did we have a father-and-son relationship?

753
3043
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:44,080
I thought we had a landlord-and-tenant relationship.

754
3047
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:50,740
Twelve years ago, you said, "Get out my house."

755
3051
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,680
"Don't step into my house again."

756
3055
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,800
Whose fault was it that I had to buy a house?

757
3059
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:04,190
That's because I'm a parent.

758
3063
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:07,990
You should try becoming a parent. That time, as a parent, I had no other choice.

759
3067
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:13,170
No. You weren't a parent at that time. You were a landlord.

760
3071
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:16,190
You said, "my house."

761
3075
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:20,480
Then, do you not have parents now?

762
3079
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:27,630
Even as a parent, if you act like a landlord, you can only be treated as one.

763
3083
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,680
Have this.

764
3087
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,920
Oh, why'd you pack so much food?

765
3091
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,430
It's just us two in my house.

766
3095
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:46,800
<i> Thank you for the food, I'll eat it well.</i>

767
3099
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:53,280
Why did you come today?

768
3103
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:57,540
Why are you asking?

769
3107
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:01,290
Mother-in-law called me, so I went.

770
3111
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:04,560
You should've called me first.

771
3115
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:11,370
I mean, you were too busy to come.

772
3119
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:14,430
So, she was asking me, at least, to come.

773
3123
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:16,710
How could I call you?

774
3127
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:21,900
Then you should have made some excuse. Say you have work or something.

775
3131
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:26,350
Why would a person who's good at defending...

776
3135
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:36,050
<i>The 'good daughter-in-law' disease.</i>

777
3139
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,190
<i>I didn't think it would happen to me.</i>
[Dear wives, when both you and your husband work, do you go to the in-laws family memorial ritual by yourself?]

778
3144
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:45,590
<i>I thought to myself, "I'm not going to be like this."</i>

779
3148
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:50,860
<i>But, today,</i>

780
3152
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,970
<i>why did I do that?</i>

781
3156
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:14,640
Do you know

782
3160
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,410
the saying,

783
3164
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,220
good daughter-in-law disease?

784
3168
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,850
Pardon? What disease?

785
3172
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,640
After marriage, girls

786
3176
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:32,260
want to be nice and pleasant to their in-laws.

787
3180
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:38,610
They want to become an obedient daughter-in-law, and they overdo it.

788
3184
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:47,890
That's what they call it good daughter-in-law disease.

789
3188
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,610
A type of need to be acknowledged, then.

790
3192
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,230
Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs that I mentioned before.

791
3196
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,860
If the low-ranking needs are fulfilled,

792
3200
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,990
the next level needs will naturally appear.

793
3204
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:05,960
Through marriage, your sense of belonging was fulfilled

794
3208
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,700
so the next level of needing to be acknowledged has appeared.

795
3212
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,530
It is a natural psychological phenomenon.

796
3216
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:18,390
Especially, wanting to be acknowledged by others is

797
3220
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:21,100
the most basic need of a human.

798
3224
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,990
Is this the only way

799
3228
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:28,130
you can interpret this?

800
3232
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,470
Pardon?

801
3236
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:35,100
That it's not about a hierarchy of human's animalistic needs,

802
3240
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:40,290
it could be one's feelings.

803
3244
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:45,360
Because it's the family of the person you like,

804
3248
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:52,990
you feel like being good to them. To the person you like,

805
3252
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:59,490
you want to make him comfortable and happy. That feeling.

806
3256
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,490
Have you never thought about

807
3260
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:10,160
how it could be due to such feelings?

808
3264
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,470
I'll shower first today.

809
3268
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:22,050
Wait...

810
3272
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,770
Ji Ho.

811
3276
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:36,240
Even though it wasn't in our contract,

812
3280
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:43,240
the unfair labor you endured today, I hope that this takes care of it.

813
3284
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:51,570
I'm sorry for making a tenant endure such an event.

814

Oh yes, she is so pretty to us.

- Yes.
 <i>- This money you gave me,</i>

841
3397
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,480
how did you calculate it?

842
3401
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,170
By any chance, is it not enough?

843
3405
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:12,360
I calculated what you earn at the cafe, and added some overtime, too.

844
3409
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:17,230
Yes. It is not enough. Not nearly enough.

845
3413
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:21,560
Ah, I see. Then how much more...?

846

I don't need the money, but I want something else.

Something else?

848
3425
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:32,030
You can pay me back by doing physical labor like I did.

849
3429
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,300
What?

850
3433
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:38,940
You can pay for it by doing physical labor at my family's home, just like I did.
