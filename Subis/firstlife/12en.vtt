What else would I do by the ocean? I'm watching the ocean.

36

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,930
Yeah. Alright. I'm coming. Okay.

37
149
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,790
Should we go back?

38
153
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,420
Yes.

39
157
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,510
But don't you think you were too angry at your mother?

40
161
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,280
I was? When was I angry?

41
165
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,320
Oh. When you speak in dialect, you usually talk louder.

42
169
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,530
Back when I was in college too. When I would be on the phone with  my mom, the girls thought I was mad at Mom.

43
173
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,650
I see how that's possible.

44
177
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,570
From what I experienced today, here,

45
181
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,810
people change the lax consonants to hard consonants or to aspirated consonants.

46
185
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,560
For example, handal (one month) to handaru.

47
189
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,080
Haebeorinda (did it) to haebbundaru.

48
193
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,390
So you analyzed that in that short time?

49
197
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,290
Yes. I needed to understand them to make kimchi.

50
201
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,650
Oh, yeppuda (pretty) is said as yibbida.

51
205
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,120
When did you . . .

52
209
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Why? Did the ahjummas tease you, saying you're pretty because you're a Seoul man?

53
213
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,360
Nope. Not me, but you.

54
217
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,370
They asked me if you were pretty to me.

55
221
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,410
Let's go. Before she calls again.

56
225
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
What? Why won't he finish his sentence?

In case something happens, come straight here. Alright?

62
249
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,350
If a war breaks out, Seoul is the first target.

63
253
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,460
So don't linger there and come straight down here.

64
257
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,470
Go now. You've got to work tomorrow.

65
261
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,830
Hey, this family's son-in-law. Where are you going?

66
265
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,710
Yes, I need to get going now.

67
269
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,860
Hey, stop already. They are busy.

68
273
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,890
Are you the only one busy? I'm busy too.

69
277
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,410
If you're going to leave, then accept a drink from me first, or else you can't go.

70
281
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,310
No. I think I shouldn't drink anymore.

71
285
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,580
So you're refusing a drink from an elder right now?

72
289
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,020
Oh...

73
293
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,830
Here. Happy?

74
297
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,770
Hey, did I say for you to drink it?

75
301
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,960
Ajae, if you try to bully my groom again,

76
305
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,990
Ajae, when your son-in-law comes down, I'll just!

77
309
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,580
drown him in a barrel of wine.

78
313
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,520
Got that?!

79
317
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,960
When did I ever bully him?

80
321
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,220
Go in now.

81
325
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,260
- We're going. 
- We'll be going.

82
330
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,850
- Go now. Being careful is Number One.
- I'll drop them off.

83
335
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,710
- I'll be back. 
- Go.

84
340
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,220
Bye.

85
344
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,640
Mister Ddo Ri got a punch from you after a long absence.

86
348
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,850
What? Did this happen before?

87
352
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:58,060
Yeah. Before, there was a wandering dog in the neighborhood that Noona would look after.

88
356
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,200
But that mister took it away saying he was going to eat it.

89
360
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,190
What? Can't be. Dog stew?

90
364
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,200
Yea, that's it.

91
368
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,060
So then? What happened?

92
372
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,770
What else? So Noona dragged their tiller out.

93
376
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,390
And she turned on the engine right at the wharf.

94
380
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,640
She said if he didn't give the dog back alive, she would sink the tiller in the water.

95
384
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,070
Unni, daebak!

96
388
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,660
Why are you talking about the past?

97
392
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,780
My noona goes all the way once she's gives her heart to someone.

98
396
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,180
Now you've got yourself shackled for life, Brother-in-law.

99
400
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,400
Drive looking forward, punk.

100
404
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,240
Alright.

101
408
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,720
Thank you. And take care of yourself. Bye.

102
412
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,130
Yeah. Go carefully, Brother-in-law.

103
416
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,550
Yes. Good bye.

104
420
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,100
Then...

105
424
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,400
Shall our baby go now too?

106
428
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,290
What?

107
432
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,540
Unni and Brother-in-law are a little strange.

108
436
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,050
What is?

109
440
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,860
They are too ... 'fresh' (new love).

110
444
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,530
Of course they are, since they're newlyweds.

111
448
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,460
No, not that new feel among newlyweds.

112
452
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,530
The flirting atmosphere from when you and I were just starting to have feelings for each other.

113
456
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,130
What are you talking about? They are married. Why would they flirt?

114
460
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,590
Let's go. It's cold.

115
464
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,830
That expression couldn't happen between husband and wife, though.

116
468
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,730
I'm here. You're in the back, right?

117
472
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,480
Yes.

118
476
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,830
It's over there.

119
480
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,650
Um. Should I ask the person next to my seat

120
484
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,630
to switch for us?

121
488
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,990
No. I think it's best to just sit in our assigned seats.

122
492
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,460
Asking someone to switch seats could be a discourtesy.

123
496
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,190
Though it seems like nothing, it's requesting something that's difficult to say no to.

124
500
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,790
Yes. Now that I think about it, it's true.

125
504
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,290
<i>In the dramas or movies that filled my early childhood,</i>

126
508
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,720
<i>a kiss was always the symbol of a happy ending.</i>

127
512
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,630
<i>However, the reason why a kiss had to be the ending,</i>

<i>now I finally know.</i>

129
520
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,000
<i>Because reality starts after that.</i>

130
524
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,460
<i>Be well.  Go back and act like nothing happened. But instead, don't ever love again. You don't deserve it.</i>

131
528
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,690
<i>And people . . .</i>

132
532
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,460
<i>they don't want to see reality.</i>

133
536
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,440
<i>Because reality could be very painful,</i>

134
540
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,260
<i>or very dark. </i>

135
544

136
548
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,760
<i>in reality, neither</i>

137

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,450
Were you well? Still, came back pretty early, right?

156
631
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,110
Maybe you should've stayed there overnight? It was a first visit home in a long time.

157
635
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,680
No, I need to go to work. Bok Nam switched the weekend shift with me.

158
639
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,620
But still, you should hurry and get some sleep, even just a few hours.

159
643
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,260
Yes.

160
647
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,460
I enjoyed making kimchi.

161
651
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,290
The trip to the ocean too.

162
655
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,550
Yes, me too.

163
659
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,150
You should head in first.

164
663
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,860
No. You should head in first.

165
667
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,850
No, still, I'll go after I see you go in.

166
671
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,800
Then...

167
675
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,020
Ah...

168
679
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:42,190
Now that I think about it, we don't have any proper pictures together.

169
683
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,890
<i>Husband</i>

170
687
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,240
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

171
691
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,750
<i>No. Not yet.</i>

172
695
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,600
<i>I have something I want to ask you.</i>

173
699
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,980
Ah, why did you do that? Why would you ask him that?

174
703
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,610
Ah...

175
707
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,310
<i>When all the ahjummas asked if I was pretty...</i>

176
711
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,730
<i>What did you say?</i>

177
715
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,480
Oh.

178
719
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,050
<i>I said that you were pretty.</i>

179
723
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:11,160
♫ <i>The things I need to do are overfilling</i> ♫

180
727
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,030
♫ <i>And I don't want to spend emotion</i> ♫

181
731
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:24,160
♫ <i>To someone like me love is an emotion that is useless</i> ♫

182
735
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,260
♫ <i>Though love passes by and I say no</i> ♫

183
739
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,570
♫ <i>when you are in front of me</i> ♫

184
743
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:41,220
♫ <i>I become wanting to hold your hands and everything's fine</i> ♫

185
747
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,170
It would be nice if we could sleep together.

186
751
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,900
In the same bed.

187
755
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,730
What did I just say? What's wrong with me?

188
759
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,470
I am trash.

189
763
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,230
<i>I need to go to work. Heat the soup before you eat.</i>

190
767
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,420
Here! Where are you going?

191
771
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,120
Zoo.

192
775
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,390
Say, "I'm going to the zoo."

193
779
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,690
I'm going to the zoo.

194
783
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,240
Thank you. Say thank you.

195
787
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,250
Thank you.

196
791
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,240
Hello, Teacher.

197
795
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,000
Hello.

198
799
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,770
Have fun.

199
803
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,160
Listen to the teacher well.

200
807
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,220
Bye.

201
811
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,820
Yoona.

202
815
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,690
Have fun! Play well.

203
819
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,300
<i>My honey honey</i>

204
823
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,630
- Yeah. 
- <i>Are you on the way? </i>

205
828
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,400
Yeah. I'm on the bus.

206
832
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,350
You're working the early shift today, right?

207
836
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,930
Yup.

208
840
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,090
Where should I go later?

209
844
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,480
It's a seven o'clock performance,

210
848
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,400
so let's meet at Daehakro then.

211
852
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,460
Okay, see you later.

212
856
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,550
Rang.

213
860
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,200
Huh?

214
864
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,840
I love you.

215
868
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,650
Yeah. Me too.

216
872
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,690
I love you.

217
876
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,200
Okay.

218
880
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,920
Comfortable, my foot.

219
884
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,950
And what's with his taste? Bleh.

220
888
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,660
<i>Tailor-made underwear</i>

221
892
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,330
<i>Tailor-made underwear</i>

222
896
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,970
How did you go around wearing it with it being so uncomfortable?

223
900
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,930
Well, half the time I wore it and half the time I took it off.

224
904
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,020
Strangely, it's always uncomfortable around the armpits.

225
908
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,270
It's because the shape of your chest is different than others.

226
912
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,190
- It is?
 - Yes.

227
917
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,640
Just like facial appearance are different from individual to individual, chest shapes are different as well.

228
921
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,650
In terms of size and in terms of volume and position.

229
925
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,170
Everyone's different in how narrow or wide but people tend to not know that.

230
929
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:49,100
They just put on ready-to-wear underwear based on size only so of course, it can't be comfortable.

231
933
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,780
So I guess a lot of people come and get theirs tailor-made?

232
937
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,460
Yes.

233
941
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,930
I just do this as a side job after I got married, but somehow people find their way here.

234
945
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,190
Yes and you have quite a lot of materials.

235
949
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,600
These materials.

236
953
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,940
How about making them into a database and make them different patterns according to chest shapes?

237
957
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,550
A database?

238
961
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,950
Yes. Well, for example . . .

239
965
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,330
Bird chest type, flat type, drooping type. Make these various patterns,

240
969
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,230
and recommend the underwear that fits that pattern.

241
973
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,820
So people could do this online without coming here,

242
977
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,160
and you could get the transaction done like that.

243
981
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,660
I don't know that stuff well.

244
985
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,320
I just didn't want my skills I learned before I got married go to waste.

245
989
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,860
And I like meeting people like this and making them one stitch at a time.

246
993
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,600
That's why I do this.

247
997
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,840
I see. I think I was too materialistic sounding. I'm ashamed.

248
1001
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,670
No, you gave me good advice.

249
1005
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,820
It's just that I'm not really talented for business.

250
1009
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,870
How much is it?

251
1013
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,830
Yes. It's $250 dollars.

252
1017
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,060
Se Hee-nim?

253
1021
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,200
Se Hee-nim?

254
1025
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,370
I fell asleep briefly.

255
1029
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,280
What are you doing here at the company on a weekend?

256
1033
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,480
Oh. I came to get a massage.

257
1037
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,190
I see. You went to do kimjang yesterday, right? Ji Ho's.

258
1041
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:01,260
Yes. It turns out that this isn't something that can be fixed with pain relieving patches.

259
1045
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,870
But what are you doing here at the company on a weekend?

260
1049
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh. For massage?

261
1053
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,800
No, nope. I came out to go on a date but I just stopped by briefly for some work.

262
1057
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,690
I see. Then, enjoy your date.

263
1061
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,210
Yes.

264
1065
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,000
Um, Se Hee-nim.

265
1069
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,240
Se Hee-nim, you must love Ji Ho a lot.

266
1073
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,350
Well, that's . . .  No, I shouldn't have asked that question.

267
1077
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,310
Then, enjoy your massage.

268
1081
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,570
Would you like to have

269
1085
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,660
a cup of coffee with me?

270
1089
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,610
Getting married isn't working out well?

271
1093
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:17,170
I don't know whether this is about marriage not working out well,

272
1097
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,250
or if it's the dating that's not going well.

273
1101
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,350
If it's not that either, then is it love that's not working out?

274
1105
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,650
It seems like you're fighting more often.

275
1109
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,620
We've always fought often.

276
1113
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,020
We've fought shouting at each other on the roadside.

277
1117
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,970
We've even thrown ribs at each other in a restaurant.

278
1121
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,840
For 7 years, we fought as if we were MMA fighters, basically.

279
1125
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,820
But now...

280
1129
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,090
Do you know what we're like?

281
1133
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,510
We don't fight.

282
1137
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:57,880
We know that our thoughts differ,

283
1141
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,810
but we still don't fight.

284
1145
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:04,510
- If we fight... 
 - You think you might not be able to go back.

285
1150
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,870
That's right.

286
1154
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,910
Truthfully, Ji Ho and I

287
1158
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,850
didn't get married because we loved each other.

288
1162
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,810
We just got married because everything was compatible.

289
1166
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,630
We decided to live together because there were no uncomfortable aspects.

290
1170
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,130
- But then... 
 - Did you develop feelings?

291
1175
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,640
Yes.

292
1179
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,760
Because I became comfortable as myself, in my heart

293
1183
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,510
there was room. I learned that through this marriage.

294
1187
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,110
It seems that love and marriage are two separate problems, indeed.

295
1191
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,550
That isn't what I meant, exactly. I just meant that you two need to be more honest with yourselves.

296
1195
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,670
Humans naturally want what is best for themselves. And marriage is

297
1199
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:15,120
one of the institutions in which that desire expresses itself most clearly.

298
1203
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,400
Desire?

299
1207
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,860
Se Hee-nim, I don't have that sort of thing.

300
1211
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,640
I just like to see Rang smile.

301
1215
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,240
I want to make Rang happy.

302
1219
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,760
And most of all, without Rang,

303
1223
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,180
it just won't do. I can't live.

304
1227
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,400
We already both know that. How much more honest can we get?

305
1231
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,450
'I... like to see you smile.'

306
1235
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,350
'I... want to make you happy.'

307
1239
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,540
'I... can't live without you.'

308
1243
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,480
The subjects of your sentences

309
1247
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,060
are all Won Seok, yourself.

310
1251
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,550
There are no sentences in which she is the subject.

311
1255
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,100
Well then, have a good date.

312
1259
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:36,720
But, what do young people nowadays do

313
1263
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,410
on a date?

314
1267
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,430
Why are you like this?

315
1271
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,670
What?

316
1275
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,490
Dirty. The table

317
1279
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,330
is so dirty.

318
1283
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,860
Are you coming back from somewhere?

319
1287
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,050
Yeah, I got fitted for a bra.

320
1291
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:51,160
Ahh. The custom place you mentioned last time?

321
1295
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,110
That's interesting. Should I try it, too?

322
1299
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,550
It's expensive though, right?

323
1303
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,980
Yes, it's stupidly expensive.

324
1307
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,660
Hey, show me your chest.

325
1311
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,620
What? Show you what?

326
1315
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,160
- Online business? 
 - Yeah.

327
1320
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,640
If we just build a system that people can use to figure out their chest type,

328
1324
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,860
I think we can make customized lingerie popularized. Don't you think so?

329
1328
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,970
That's right. There's no reason it wouldn't work.

330
1332
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,960
But are you planning to do that yourself?

331
1336
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,500
How would I do that? I have to go to work at the company.

332
1340
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,370
I just think it might be fun, so I want to try it as a hobby.

333
1344
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,250
I can give the idea to the designer lady, too.

334
1348
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,800
You should try it yourself.

335
1352
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,870
You've always wanted to run your own business.

336
1356
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,880
What do you think about just going for it?

337
1360
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,800
Hey, how can I quit such a prestigious company?

338
1364
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,040
Even if it's terrible, they pay the best in my industry.

339
1368
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:09,500
Also, as you know, my life isn't just mine.

340
1372
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,280
I...

341
1376
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,620
This unni has a different situation than you guys.

342
1380
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,260
Sorry, I just...

343
1384
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,390
I noticed that your eyes were sparkling when you were telling me your idea.

344
1388
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,060
My eyes sparkled?

345
1392
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,600
Yes.

346
1396
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,940
Did they sparkle as much as your eyes sparkled when you talk about your landlord.

347
1400
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,870
Why change the subject to that?

348
1404
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:46,550
I have something that I'm really curious about.

349
1408
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,910
You don't want to do it with your landlord?

350
1412
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,130
- Do what? 
 - What do you mean? He's a man you like

351
1417
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,660
whom you live with in one house. Is your body... okay?

352
1421
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,450
You don't get hot and bothered when he's in the room right next to yours?

353
1425
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:04,790
I don't get hot and bothered. What gets heated? It's not like that. No way. What are you saying?

354
1429
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,770
For real? This is fascinating.

355
1433
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:12,640
Is it because you've been single since birth? Because you don't know anything?

356
1437
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:25,140
But be careful, Ji Ho. If you're not planning to sleep with him, don't even touch him.

357
1441
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,690
- Why? 
 - What do you mean why?

358
1446
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,530
Don't you remember my first boyfriend in college?

359
1450
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,160
Ahhh. The boyfriend you only held hands with for six months?

360
1454
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,230
Yes, I became depressed because he didn't move things along.

361
1458
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:41,160
So, if you're not planning to go all the way, don't even start skin contact.

362
1462
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,070
The first feelings of desire are the scariest, especially for people who've been single their whole life, like you.

363
1466
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,960
It's like opening Pandora's box. Got it?

364
1470
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,620
<i>That's right. In this contract marriage,</i>

365
1474
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,590
<i>I had overlooked a very important truth.</i>

366
1478
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,890
<i>I went to all-girl's middle and high schools</i>

367
1482
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,160
<i>and never got to date in college.</i>

368
1486
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,370
<i>The fact that I've been single since birth. (mo-tae solo)
 [mo-tae = since the womb] + [solo]</i>

369
1491
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:22,000
<i>I can't believe that such a person like me ended up living together with a man.</i>

370
1495
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,960
- Hey, it started. 
 - Oh, daebak!

371
1500
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,860
<i>Wow, he is so good!</i>

372
1504
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,390
<i>And with the man that opened my Pandora's box, of all people.</i>

373
1508
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,830
Why is he so good? Isn't this your first time?

374
1512
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,470
Hey, the beginners are the scariest because they don't know anything.

375
1516
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,490
I know, right? Beginners are scary.

376
1520
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:47,120
Ahhh, how many times a day are you thinking of the kiss, you mo-sol (single since birth)!

377
1524
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,830
Does your head hurt?

378
1528
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,040
No, but how are you here?

379
1532
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,560
Ah, I was at the company for a bit and decided to drop by.

380
1536
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,900
I thought it was about time you got off work, Ji Ho.

381
1540
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,260
It's the weekend. Is there anything you want to do?

382
1544
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,500
What I want to do?

383
1548
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,730
What I want to do.

384
1552
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:33,820
Yes, is there anything you want to do?

385
1556
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,530
No, there's nothing.

386
1560
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,620
There's nothing at all I want to do!

387
1564
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:04,060
Then, shall we do something I want to do?

405
1637
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,730
Cats can choose what is important to them

406
1641
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,530
and can choose to only remember those things.

407
1645
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,190
That means they can easily forget what they don't need to remember.

408
1649
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,650
That is the reason why I like cats.

409
1653
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,880
- What about you, Ji Ho? 
 - Pardon?

410
1658
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,880
Do you have an animal you like?

411
1662
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,170
Oh, an animal I like?

412
1666
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,060
For me, snails.

413
1670
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,980
Snails?

414
1674
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:17,640
Yes, snails. They carry around their home for their whole life.

415
1678
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,030
Oh, that's very true.

416
1682
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,520
Snails have their own home from birth.

417
1686
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,980
Well, that is a new interpretation for me.

418
1690
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,300
Should we go do that?

419
1694

Pardon? Where now?

420
1698

Oh, you guys said you were watching a performance today, right?

432

433
1753
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,790
I'm not sure. He suddenly asked me to come here.

434

00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,330
Oh, a dating course. <i> (T/N: Similar to a date schedule.)</i>

00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:22,150
- Huh? 
 - He asked me earlier what people these days do on dates.

436
1766
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:25,160
So, I told him our dating course.

437
1770
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,050
A date?

438
1774

I'll do another round, ₩10,000 ($10) worth.

439
1778
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,760
- He must be a chaebol. (very rich)
 - Again?

00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,600
No, this is yours, so you have to hold onto it.

455
1844
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,530
Gosh, why isn't she picking her phone up?

456
1848
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,000
Oh, I'm sorry! Did you wait a long time?

457
1852
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,780
- Yeah. 
 - I'm really sorry.

458
1857
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,890
I was working at home and I lost track of time.

459
1861
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,430
Why was your phone turned off?

460
1865
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,390
You called me?

461
1869
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,320
Oh, I left it at home.

462
1873
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,560
I told you that I'd go to the front of your home. Why do we keep coming here?

463
1877
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,600
I'm sorry.

464
1881
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,590
Are you, by any chance, not wearing a bra today?

465
1885
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:41,680
No, not today. It's not "no bra," but "no panty."

466
1889
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,610
You really...

467
1893
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,020
Is it true?

468
1897
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,560
You can check for yourself.

469
1901
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,780
Woo Soo Ji, you bad girl.

470
1905
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,820
If it's true, you'll be punished by me!

471
1909
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:03,290
It is cold today. If possible, you should try to wear one more layer. I must check!

472
1913
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:08,290
Come here! I'm going to check if it's really a lie or not.

473
1917
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,780
What's this? Do you carry a hair dryer around?

474
1921
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,650
Yeah, the one here is pretty weak. I like using mine better.

475
1925
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,670
So, why are we meeting outside our homes and going through all of this trouble?

476
1929
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,360
If we meet at home, you don't have to carry these things around.

477
1933
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,460
In all honesty, is there anyone who hasn't visited their girlfriend's home?

478
1937
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,190
Why are we here instead of your home?

479
1941
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:45,790
Oh, just give me that. You can't dry it like that.

480
1945
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,310
I'm an expert.

481
1949
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,450
- Hey, do it properly. 
 - I am.

482
1954
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,560
Your hair's just weird. It's getting tangled up. Is it a wig?

483
1958
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,960
It's pretty.

484
1962
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,800
Really?

485
1966
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,290
Yes. It's so pretty.

486
1970
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,920
But, why'd you suddenly get me this?

487
1974
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,930
Oh, after thinking about it,

488
1978
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,030
I realized I never gave you a gift.

489
1982
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:43,360
Even for our wedding, there were no rings.

490
1986
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:48,670
So, I always wanted to do something for you, at least once.

491
1990
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,300
Although it may be obvious and banal, but still, like what others do.

492
1994
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,980
That kind of gift.

493
1998
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,290
Yes, I see.

494
2002
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:04,820
So is that why we had a date that was also obvious and banal, like what others do?

495
2006
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,500
What we did today?

496
2010
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,340
Ah, well...

497
2014
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,810
I heard you asked Won Seok

498
2018
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,870
what people these days do for dates.

499
2022
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:25,600
Yes. I thought about it and realized our generations are quite different.

500
2026
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,320
I didn't really know what to do for the date.

501
2030
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,560
That's true. After thinking about it,

502
2034
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,400
you're really a lot older than me. You were born in 1980, so,

503
2038
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,730
when I entered elementary school, you were a middle schooler.

504
2042
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,780
When I was in middle school,

505
2046
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,260
you were a soldier ahjussi.

506
2050
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,090
I wouldn't go as far as to say soldier ahjussi.

507
2054
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,990
Just, soldier.

508
2058
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,450
Okay.

509
2062
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:05,860
I asked CEO Ma once

510
2066
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:09,660
where I would have to go with an '80er on a date.

511
2070
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,070
You came here a lot while you attended school, he said.

512
2074
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,880
Yes.

Oh, I'll have this.

516

Don't they?

544
2202

Rang, Ji Ho's husband has a funny personality, doesn't he?

545
2206
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,430
I mean, how could he do exactly what I told him to do?

546
2210
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:07,050
I know. They both seem so 'fresh' (like a new love).

547
2214
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:10,670
Maybe we should have played the balloon-popping game, too? It's been a while.

548

- No, it's a waste of money.
 - Right?

I think we ordered too much.

551
2231
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:24,620
Ah. Your mother bought this for me since I got a job.

552
2235
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,860
Did she?

553

<i>You need to be more honest with each other.</i>

Rang. About our marriage.

560
2267
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,150
- Yeah?
 - Do you think you could wait a little bit more?

561
2272
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,920
How much longer?

562
2276
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,670
About five years?

563
2280
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,340
Five years?

564
2284
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,440
Yeah.

565
2288
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,790
No matter how much I think about it, I think it's going to take that long.

566
2292
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,420
Won Seok, if we wait for five more years, I'll be 35 then.

567
2296
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:30,680
Are you saying we should date for 12 years?

568
2300
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,720
Rang, if you're tired, do you just want to go home and rest?

569
2304
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,790
It's fine. You said you reserved it, so we should watch it.

570
2308

<i>Looking for Kim Jong Min</i>

571
2312
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,620
Let's go.

572
2316
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,980
What is this?

573
2320
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,820
Weren't we watching, "Looking for Kim Jong Wook"?

574
2324
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,900
"Looking for Kim Jong Wook"?

575
2328
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,120
Wasn't it "Looking for Kim Jong Min"?

576
2332
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,200
No, I...

577
2336
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,190
I never imagined there would be a "Looking for Kim Jong Wook" and also "Looking for Kim Jong Min."

578
2340
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:30,670
It's fine. We can still cancel it and reserve it again.

579
2344
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,630
It's fine. The other show would already be sold out.

580
2348
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,550
Let's just watch this.

581
2352
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,390
Have you seen Kim Jong Min?

582
2356
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:48,660
They said there was someone who've seen him here.

583
2360
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,820
Ah. You must not know him.

584
2364
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,520
Was there a girl looking for me? Where is she?

585
2368
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,750
Where is she right now?!

586
2372
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:06,030
It looks like I just missed her, again.

587
2376
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:11,760
<i>- Yang Ho Rang, are you crazy? What's wrong with you?!
- Marriage!!!</i>

588
2381
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,500
<i>I want to get married, you stupid idiot. </i>

589
2385
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:24,590
<i>However, I'm still not sure what marriage is.</i>

590
2389
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:30,830
<i>Are love and marriage the same thing?</i>

591
2393
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:38,480
<i>Just how much longer do I have to go to find her?</i>

592
2397
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,460
<i>Even if it's not next year, but in two years, it's better to be prepared.</i>

593
2401
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:48,410
<i>When will I be able to see him again?</i>

594
2405
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,110
<i>Rang, what do you mean in two years?</i>

595
2409
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:53,390
<i>How can we get married in two years?</i>

596
2413
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:56,630
<i>Do you think you could wait a little bit more?</i>

597
2417
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,930
<i>Five more years.</i>

598
2421
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:05,690
<i>Won Seok, if I have to wait five more years, I'll be 35 then.</i>

599
2425
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:09,290
<i>Are you saying we should date for 12 years?</i>

600
2429
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:16,470
<i>Why are we always out of step with each other? </i>

601
2433
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,190
You should take a shower first.

602
2437
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:51,440
What? Take a shower first?!

603
2441
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,920
Yes. Since I took a shower first yesterday,

604
2445
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,520
you should take it first today.

605
2449
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,970
Ah. That's what you meant.

606
2453
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,650
What? What...

607
2457
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,500
Is there something else it could mean?

608
2461
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,950
No.

609
2465
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,420
No, how could it mean anything else?

610
2469
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,990
When someone says to shower first, it just means to shower first, of course.

611
2473
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:23,500
Ah, you should take a shower first.

612
2477
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,520
I need to erase my makeup, so...

613
2481
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,760
You put on makeup?

614
2485
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,560
Yes. Why?

615
2489
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:40,600
Nothing. I thought you don't use makeup.

616
2493
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,530
Since your bare face after you wash it looks the exact same as you do, always.

617
2497
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:50,980
What the heck? I put makeup on today.

618
2501
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:11,500
What the heck? He's making my heart skip a beat in such unexpected ways.

619
2505
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:20,500
But how much longer will my heart just continue to skip a beat?

620
2509
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,130
Love is not platonic, you 1980 ahjussi.

621
2513
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,930
<i>It's pretty.</i>

622
2517
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,360
What's wrong with me?

623
2521
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,860
Are you crazy?

624
2525
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,760
Now you're getting excited over a woman's touch?

625
2529
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,150
Are you obscene or something?

626
2533
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,360
I will drive you to your home, Oppa.

627
2537
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,160
I don't want to.

628
2541
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,650
I just wanted to take you home.

629
2545
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,590
Do you know how dangerous underground parking lots are these days?

630
2549
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:06,630
You are stubborn about such weird things.

631
2553
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:10,620
Excuse me, Ms. Woo Soo Ji, do you have any thoughts of marriage?

632
2557
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,880
Marriage?

633
2561
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,460
Not at all.

634
2565
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,070
- Not at all?
 - Yeah.

635
2570
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:20,060
Do you plan on doing it, CEO Ma? Marriage?

636
2574
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,970
Me? Well,

637
2578
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:26,630
if there is a chance, then sure, I may.

638
2582
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:30,600
But eating together, and going grocery shopping together,

639
2586
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:35,000
and fighting and making up, and sharing our daily lives,

640
2590
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,990
I think it could be pretty nice.

641
2594
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,120
That's why I don't want to.

642
2598
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:44,540
How can you share such plain daily life stuff with someone and still have sex? It totally ruins the fantasy.

643
2602
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,620
What?

644
2606
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:50,360
Marriage is the grave of a man-woman relationship. It's the end of sexuality.

645
2610
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:55,040
Think about it. A man and woman are always fighting about loans or the Thanksgiving holiday.

646
2614
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,970
How can they sleep together? Am I wrong?

647
2618
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:03,000
Soo Ji, that is how regular people live.

648
2622
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,070
They may bicker and fight, but they also comfort each other at times.

649
2626
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:08,840
That's how everyone lives their lives.

650
2630
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,930
I don't want to do the same things that others do.

651
2634
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:17,630
My life is burdensome enough, and I know my place in the world.

652
2638
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,040
I have no intention of ruining someone else's life.

653
2642
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:32,070
<i>Sexless, Your Health is in Danger!</i>

654
2646
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,590
That's right.

<i>First, insomnia. Second, sensitive.</i>

656
2654

657
2658
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,130
Indeed,

658
2662
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,480
I am deeply frustrated right now.

659
2666
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,730
This is dangerous.

660
2670
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:41,460
I enjoyed reading the book.

661
2674
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:45,740
I didn't know it was a special memory, but I ended up borrowing it.

662
2678
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,580
I'm sorry.

665
2690
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,020
I don't want to. I'll take the subway. Chugga-chugga-choo-choo.

666
2694
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,340

Aigoo, it's fine, Woo Soo Ji.

668
2702
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:19,020
No, if you really feel bad, then you should treat me to a cup of coffee in your house.

669
2706
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:24,240
Come on, I came all the way here, so how could you not give me at least a cup of coffee?

670
2710
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,920
So you had ulterior motives? I didn't think you were like this, but you are very cunning.

671
2714
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,850
I'm not cunning.

672
2718
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,680
I just want to take a look around my girlfriend's house.

673
2722
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,090
I'm just curious about your room's smell.

674
2726
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:37,990
I'm also curious about your pajamas. Okay, fine.

675
2730
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:40,660
I'm even curious about your messy bathroom.

676
2734
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,200
But why would you be curious about that?

677
2738
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,600
I really can't understand you.

678
2742
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,580
No, I just want to share our daily life with each other.

679
2746
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,290
Go, before the subway stops running for the night.

680
2750
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,210
I need to go and work.

681
2754
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:57,790
Ah, that's right. Do you want to take some freshly-made kimchi home with you? Ji Ho gave me some.

682
2758
00:59:57,790 --> 01:00:00,190
No thanks. I quit eating kimchi.

Perhaps, did you invite a friend over to your house?

696

No. Who would come over at this hour?

01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:10,800
<i>However, today, in that place,</i>

753
3049
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:17,220
<i>for a moment</i>

754
3053
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,680
<i>I was happy.</i>

755
3057
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,970
<i>For a moment,</i>

756
3061
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:26,120
<i>I had forgotten.</i>

757
3065
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:35,760
Do you want to watch it together?

758
3069
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:51,830
♫ <i>without even taking a breath, I passed by so many things</i> ♫

759
3073
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:55,630
<i>To me, this woman</i>

760
3077
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,800
<i>is pretty.</i>
 ♫ <i>after wandering here and there</i> ♫

761
3082
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,460
♫ <i>I forgot where I was headed to</i> ♫

762
3086
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:10,900
<i>To me, her heart is adorable.</i>

763
3090
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,930
<i>However...</i>

764
3094
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:25,090
Goodnight.

765
3098
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:29,400
Yes. Goodnight.

766
3102
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:40,860
<i>... at the same time, I am scared.</i>

767
3106
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:45,660
<i>I am afraid of myself.</i>

768
3110
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:48,960
<i>That I might</i>

769
3114
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,860
<i>hurt someone else again.</i>

770
3118
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,450
<i>However...</i>

771
3122
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,490
<i>Now, I also...</i>

772
3126
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:12,360
Should we

773
3130
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,250
sleep together tonight?

774
3134
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:27,490
<i>...want to be happy.</i>

775
3138
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:33,670
♫ <i>even when I don't want to love</i> ♫

776
3142
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,930
♫ <i>when you are in front of me</i> ♫

777
3146
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:42,190
♫ <i>oh, I want to hold your hand, and whatever happens,
 I am happy</i> ♫

778
3151
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:46,120
♫ <i>you make me want to love</i> ♫

779
3155
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:50,540
<i>Because This is My First Life</i>

780
3159
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:54,260
<i>You must've been uncomfortable.</i>

781
3163
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:57,990
<i>When you're in love, there are more things you must protect.</i>
11/5: She looked at me weirdly... 11/10: Because today's sea is my first.

782
3168
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:00,290
<i>How nice, such a relationship.</i>

783
3172
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:05,700
<i>A CEO from a production company came to find me today.</i>

784
3176
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:09,300
<i>Have you heard about her, after that time?</i>

785
3180
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,460
<i>Was this the relationship you wanted with me, CEO Ma?</i>

786
3184
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:14,670
<i>Intruding into parts of my private life that I don't want to show you?</i>

787
3188
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:18,360
<i>I want to make a good story that I can share.</i>

788
3192
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,930
<i>I've done it once before. Something like marriage.</i>

789
3196
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:26,500
<i>Both he and I each have Room Nineteen (referring to "To Room Nineteen" by Doris Lessing)</i>
