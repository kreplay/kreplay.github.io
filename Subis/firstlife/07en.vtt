<i> Yoon Ji Ho? </i>

10
41
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
Yes that's me. Who is it?

11
45
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,650
It's me, Alleyway.

12
49
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,820
Alleyway?

13
53
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,770
Ah, the guy from the alleyway when I was looking for Bok Nam.

14
57
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,290
<i> Yes, Bok Nam. </i>

15
61
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,550
Ah, but what is it?

16
65
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,480
<i>I had something to ask. Do you have paper with you?</i>

17
69
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,620
Paper?

18
73
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,950
Yes, I do.

19
77
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,030
<i>What about a pen?</i>

20
81
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,230
I have a pen.

21

00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,730
<i>- Do you have a boyfriend? 
 - A boyfriend...</i>

22
90
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,370
What?

23
94
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,570
<i>Do you have a boyfriend?</i>

24
98
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,590
I don't...

25
102
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,800
have a boyfriend

26
106
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,150
I'm leaving.

27
110
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,670
Why are you asking that?

28
114
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,870
Ah, I saw Bok Nam in the alleyway. He was wandering around alone again.

29
118
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,690
Oh, really? Bok Nam ran away again?

30
122
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,920
But...

31
126
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,480
It has nothing to do with me anymore.

32
130
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,880
I probably didn't get that restaurant's part-time...

33
134
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,990
Ah, do you want me to tell you the name of that restaurant? You can try contacting them directly.

34
138
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,050
<i> The alleyway you saw last time. </i>

35
142
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,860
Come there by 11:30am. You'll only find Bok Nam if you come by then.

36
146
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,520
Hello? Why would I—

37
150
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,560
Hello?

38
154
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,650
What time was it?

39
158
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,390
11am?

40
162
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,060
Ah, 11:30am.

41
166
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,730
He said the puppy's alone.

42
170
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,240
That's right. It's because I'm jobless.

43
174
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,760
I have a lot of time on my hands.

44
178
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,590
What? All you do is sleep, too.

45
182
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,360
What?

46
186
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,340
<i> Is he a celebrity? </i>

47
190
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,860
<i> - Wow. 
 - Is he a doll? </i>

48
195
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,850
What is it?

49
199
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,920
We're looking at the profiles,

50
203
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,430

52
214

- I'm so jealous. 
 - Wow.
<i>Attractive qualities: I look young for my age, I live alone, natural sense of humor, Interests: Movies, Leisure activities, bicycle, I like to meet this way: On Fridays</i>

53
220
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,600
Isn't this score really the highest we've ever had?

54
224
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,060
- This is the first time a male member has surpassed 9 points, right? 
 - You're right. 
 - It's the first time.

55
230
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,020
So, this is the type of guy who's really popular nowadays.

56
234
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,420
They look like puppies.

57
238
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,520
You mean they look as cute like puppies.

58
242
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,430
- How old is he? 
 - 24 years old.

59
247
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,200
Then he's... 2 years older than me?

60
251
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,530
Oh gosh. Why would you make such an ugly face? You scared me.

61
255
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,790
I should be saying that.

62
259
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,040
What about Bok Nam?

63
263
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,900
Follow me.

64
267
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,670
Why are we here? What about Bok Nam?

65
271
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,750
Let's go in first, then we'll find Bok Nam.

66
275
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,480
No.

67
279
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,710
I can't go in.

68
283
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,920
I didn't get the part time job here.

69
287
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,330
What?

70
291
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,070
Didn't the owner here ask you to find Bok Nam?

71
295
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,570
I know, right. He told me to look for his puppy as soon as I met him.

72
299
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,720
Also if they don't call then that means I got rejected.

73
303
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,730
No, why?

74
307
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,020
How can you fail to get a part-time job? It's not like being admitted to colleges.

75
311
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,260
It's possible.

76
315
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,690
I'm old and don't have the experience.

77
319
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,880
From the owner's point of view he must have felt burdened.

78
323
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,430
What do you mean burdened? What part of you is burdensome?

79
327
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,580
You look super easy to order around, perfect for a part-time employee.

80
331
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,940
How could he miss such a talent. Is he blind or what?

81
335
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,830
Are you... complimenting me right now?

82
339
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,880
Of course I am. Today you came out to help find Bok Nam again.

83
343
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,600
Wow. What is the owner doing?

84
347
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,470
He asked you to find his puppy and now he's rejecting you from a part-time job.

85
351
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,500
Let's you see why you didn't get the job.

86
355
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,900
Why would I...

87
359
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,140
<i> Wait just a bit. Thank you.</i>

88
363
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,100
Bok Nam you jerk. I'm so busy why are you only coming now?

89
367
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,290
Bok Nam?

90
371
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,130
So I brought a new part-time worker. I'm recommending her for her work ethic.

91
375
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,860
Hey Bok Nam, why are you doing things no one told you to?

92
379
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,420
Where is Bok Nam that he keeps calling his name?

93
383
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,860
<i>Bok Nam.</i>

94
387
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,090
That person, I'm going to use her as my minion starting tomorrow.

95
391
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,230
Hey! Yeon Bok Nam, you...

96
395
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,100
Bok... Nam.

97
399
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,890
Curly brown fur and... pink.

98
403
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,330
Bok Nam was a person?

99
407
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,660
If you don't hire this person I'm going to quit.

100
411
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,390
- What! 
 - What!

101
416
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,420
I was going to call you but,

102
420
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,930
the shop was so busy.

103
424
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,110
- Ah yes. 
 - Yes.

104
429
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,130
But perhaps, are you picking me because of the threat, even though I'm lacking?

105
433
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,640
No, it's fine if Bok Nam likes you.

106
437
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,320
You need to be liked by your coworker.

107
441
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,730
Then, start working tomorrow.

108
445
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,060
Yes, thank you.

109
449
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,670
Excuse me.

110
453
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,660
Were you hired?

111
457
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,090
Yes.

112
461
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,660
That's great.

113
465
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,400
Why are you treating me this way?

114
469
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,260
- What? 
 - Pardon?

115
474
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,300
Calling you to meet me? Or hiding that I was Bok Nam?

116
478
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,650
Or that I'm getting you hired? Which one?

117
482
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,480
Uh... um...

118
486
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,730
Well... All three.

119
490
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,630
Hey, Bok Nam! Deliver this to Mr. Yoo. Right now.

120
494
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,300
Yes.

121
498
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,490
Come here.

122
502
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,490
Why?

123
506
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,890
You told me to tell you the reason I'm being like this.

124
510
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,320
What are you doing?

125
514
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,290
The owner said to hurry and make this delivery.

126
518
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,600
Hurry and get on. I'll tell you on the way.

127
522
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,830
- Really? 
 - Hurry and get on.

128
527
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,700
I'm busy.

129
531
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,550
The kimchi has to be tasty, the kimchi.

130
535
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,770
If possible, let's eat lunch out more often,

131
539
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,160
like human beings.

132
543
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,890
Oh, it's Sae Hee's wife.

133
547
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,470
You're really on guard.

134
551
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,260
Tell me now, why did you do that?

135
555
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,330
Why do you think? I did it because I like you.

136
559
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,980
Me?

137
563
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,990
Who else would it be?

138
567
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,010
Hello, Mr. Yoo. I'm nearby. I can swing by, right?

139
571
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,940
Yes, yes.

140
575
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,120
See you tomorrow then.

141
579
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,920
Excuse me.

142
583
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,530
I think I led you to misunderstand.

143
587
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't have a boyfriend,

144
591
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,300
but I have a husband.

145
595
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,420
That's sister-in-law's brother, they look alike.

146
599
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,790
What are you talking  about? You saw her brother at the wedding.

147
603
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,660
So what?

148
607
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,800
- Huh?  
- So you have a husband what does that have to do with me?

149
612
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,590
If you have a husband, does that mean you can't have a  boyfriend?

<i> Episode 7 
 It's My First Time Saying YOLO </i>

151
621
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,630
He said what? "If you have a husband, does that mean you can't have a  boyfriend?"

152
625
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,200
So? What did you say?

153
629
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,670
What do you mean? I was speechless.

154
633
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,210
Kids nowadays come off strong.

155
637
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,900
- How old did you say he was? 24? 
 - I know, right?

156
642
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,430
24 years old.

157
646
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,020
Wow, there's a limit to how far you can take a joke.

158
650
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,900
Hey, Woo Soo. Work hard at your company.

159
654
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,050
Even it's hard, survive until the end. Understand?

160
658
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,540
There's nothing I can do after quitting as a writer.

161
662
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,860
At my age of half-sixty, working part-time with a boy who's younger than my little brother and suffering this cajolement.

162
666
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,190
Hey, that's not something you should say to a company worker who's getting cajoled by the bastards everyday.

163
670
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,720
Huh?

164
674
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,150
I'm sorry.

165
678
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:39,210
Where's Ho Rang? Isn't the restaurant closed today?

166
682
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,560
She's in shock right now.

167
686
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,230
Why?

168
690
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,430
<i>I thought you loved me.</i>

169
694
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,650
<i>Of course. You know that I can't live without you.</i>

170
698
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,840
<i>But, loving someone and getting married isn't the same.</i>

171
702
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,300
<i>- Huh?
- It means having kids and being responsible. Marriage.</i>

172
707
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,120
<i>How will I be able to do that.</i>

173
711
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,570
<i>Are love and marriage the same?</i>

174
715
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,150
Get a hold of yourself Yang Ho Rang you shouldn't be like this now.

175
719
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,880
Did they forget our radish?

176
723
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,990
It's right here.

177
727
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,930
- Who is it?
 <i>- It's me! Me!</i>

178
732
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,610
Oh!

179
736
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,250
What's up? I thought you couldn't come.

180
740
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,590
Recommend me some books.

181
744
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,480
Books? Things to read?

182
748
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,900
Why do you need them?

183
752
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,390
Why do you need books all of a sudden?

184
756
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,360
Books on human breeding and necessities of the marital institution.

185
760
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,950
Why? Is this because of Won Seok?

186
764
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,670
Are you okay? Did you go insane from the shock?

187
768
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,710
No. My head just got clearer.

188
772
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,980
What? He loves me but he doesn't know about marriage?

189
776
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,320
I mean, he thought if he said it like that, I'd be like, "What? But you love me."

190
780
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,870
"Why am I not in your future?"

191
784
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,770
Should I be crying like this in my room?

192
788
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,520
Who does he take me for?

193
792
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,920
She's giving me goosebumps. She can go to Cannes with that.

194
796
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,810
You know it already. I put in seven years of my life into Sim Won Seok, who used to be like Alpha Go, and changed him into how he is now.

195
800
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,230
But I trained him to be a boyfriend until now.

196
804
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,960
Now, I have to train him to be a husband.

197
808
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,820
I'm going to the bookstore so text me some book titles.

198
812
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,690
Hey eat before you go.

199
816
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,930
Forget it. I don't have time to chat.

200
820
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,660
- A guy who was born in 1994 asked for Ji Ho's phone number. 
- Hey.

201
825
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,680
In 1994? How old is he?

202
829
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,510
Twenty-four.

203
833
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,690
Bring out the soju.

204
837
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,440
Okay

205
841
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,680
You're late

206
845
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,260
Yes.

207
849
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,630
Kitty must have thrown up.

208
853
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,130
Yes, it seems so. I saw this when I got home from work.

209
857
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,620
Is she okay? Is she sick?

210
861
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,390
Sometimes she throws up without a reason.

211
865
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,420
Still, I don't know, so tomorrow I will take her to the hospital.

212
869
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,760
Ah, If you are getting off late tomorrow I will ta—

213
873
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,640
<i>I find it a bit uncomfortable. It's my cat but ,</i>

214
877
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,960
<i>having someone call it by another name is uncomfortable.</i>

215
881
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,650
What? In the afternoon?

216
885
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,350
Oh. In the afternoon, I have to go to work.

217
889
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,960
I got a part-time job.

218
893
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,820
Uh-huh yes, the Yolo cafe next to my workplace.

219
897
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,180
I saw you near the company,

220
901
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,260
on the back of a motorcycle.

221
905
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,250
Ahhh, yeah, that's right, earlier I was close to your office.

222
909
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,620
Did you see me? The other part timer told me he was busy so he told me to get on.

223
913
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,550
But that guy's joke was excessive.

224
917
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,170
- From the first time we met—
 - You seemed rather close with him from since it's first time you met,

225
922
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,560
with that part-timer.

226
926
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,130
I mean since we're working together—

227
930
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,250
You only work together.

228
934
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,700
But you seem quite close with that part-timer.

229
938
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,000
Then, have a good night.

230
942
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,970
Excuse me...

231
946
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,730
Are you upset with me?

232
950
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,860
No, why would I be?

233
954
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,230
I know, right. Why would you be?

234
958
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,460
There's no way.

235
962
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,260
He must be upset because of Kitty.

236
966
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,020
<i>Oh, this tastes good.</i>

237
970
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,120
<i>Come to YOLO, 24 years old. Seoul. Taking time off from college, 183cm tall, lean toned type.</i>

238
974
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,540
<i>That man earlier. The one with the highest score. It's him, isn't it?</i>

239
978
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,250
<i>You're right. He works part-time at the YOLO cafe.</i>

240
982
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,460
<i>They opened recently.</i>

241
986
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,400
<i>Oh. I hard that sister-in-law was looking for a part-time job.</i>

242
990
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,890
<i>They must be work colleagues.</i>

243
994
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,150
<i>How can a part-timer afford to ride that kind of motorcycle?</i>

244
998
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,660
<i>The cheap ones cost 30-40 million won. Don't they?</i> ($30,000-$40,000)

245
1002
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,290
<i>Some cost more than ₩100 million.</i>

246
1006
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:18,420
<i>I know. Why does he work as a part-timer when he drives around this kind of motorcycle?</i>

247
1010
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,840
<i>It doesn't really make any sense.</i>

248
1014
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,260
<i>You only live once. Personality: Laid Back, Outgoing</i>

249
1018
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,830
- Rang, should I take the lights off? 
- Later, after I finish watching this.

250
1023
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,730
What are you looking at?

251
1027
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,440
Rang, why are you watching it? This is not like you.

252
1031
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,820
Oh, I am sorry. Please be understanding. I am ovulating now.

253
1035
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,920
What does your ovulation have to do with this?

254
1039
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,000
It's when the level of luteinizing hormone peaks.

255
1043
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,620
Luteinizing what?

256
1047
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,220
It's the hormone that boosts female sex hormones.

257
1051
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,360
I think my instinct to breed becomes stronger.

258
1055
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,820
I must be instinctively seeking these beast-like (muscular) men.

259
1059
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,780
What are you doing?

260
1063
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,500
So you're saying your hormones are at high levels now.

261
1067
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,800
A healthy boyfriend like me exists so you could release that.

262
1071
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,470
I must prove my reason for existence today.

263
1075
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,130
I'm sorry. I don't think I can do it with you tonight.

264
1079
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,580
What are you saying all of a sudden?

265
1083
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,240
Of course sexual desires peak during ovulation.

266
1087
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,880
Still woman doesn't allow mating to just anyone. Evolutionary psychology

267
1091
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,650
dictates that the female instinctively searches for the male who could safely protect its children.

268
1095
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,590
Since we don't have any plans for marriage,

269
1099
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,580
my body must sense you as a potentially dangerous element.

270
1103
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:38,680
The black-headed weaver (bird) too. When the male doesn't build a strong nest during a mating season, the female will just leave without a second look.

271
1107
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,700
A black-headed weaver?

272
1111
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,030
There's something like that? Rang, it's about animals.

273
1115
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,630
We aren't birds. We are human.

274
1119
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,170
Humans are animals. Haven't you read the book "The Selfish Gene"?

275
1123
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,930
Humans are just a machine to pass down the gene to the next generation. Nothing more or nothing less than that.

276
1127
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Rang, you read that book?

277
1131
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,710
So please be understanding during my ovulation. I need an outlet to relieve my desires.

278
1135
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,640
Rang, do you love me?

279
1139
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,060
Of course, you know I can't live without you either.

280
1143
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,700
Then you can sleep with me instead of looking at that.

281
1147
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,100
I thought about what you said.

282
1151
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,800
If we sleep together there is a possibility I could get pregnant. Even if we are careful,

283
1155
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,790
there are still risks.

284
1159
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,810
But, I can't do it with someone who is unsure our future together.

285
1163
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:45,230
However, I don't know about sleeping together just because we are in love.

286
1167
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,060
Huh?

287
1171
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:57,500
It's quite hard. I sometimes think about that, too.

288
1175
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,740
Is love and sexual desire the same thing?

289
1179
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,120
Rang, where did you get those glasses from?

290
1183
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,950
I bought them today. They hired a new part-timer in the optometry nearby.

291
1187
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,950
That guy, he looks like this guy.

292
1191
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,130
You woke up early today?

293
1195
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,670
Yes, I have to start working today.

294
1199
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,330
I didn't eat breakfast today.

295
1203
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,060
Yes

296
1207
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,760
Would you like one?

297
1211
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,440
It's really good to eat as a meal replacement in the mornings.

298
1215
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,080
Okay. I will eat it well.

299
1219
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,900
Thank you.

300
1223
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,700
You get off at the next stop, don't you?

301
1227
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,670
Yes, the cafe is close to my office.

302
1231
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,360
So, when you are free sometime you should c—

303
1235
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,830
<i>If possible, I want to avoid situations when we have to pretend that we're a married couple<i></i></i>

304
1239
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,970
<i>like today if we could in the future.</i>

305
1243
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,980
Nothing.

306
1247
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,550
I'll see you at home.

307
1251
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,780
<i>Noona!</i>

308
1255
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,060
- Noona?
- Then what? Hyung?

309
1260
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,100
Since you're a cute Noona, I'll call you Noona. I'll continue to call you that in the future, too.

310
1264
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,380
What?

311
1268
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,980
Ah, also don't use informal speech.

312
1272
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,280
I'm more old-fashioned than I look. I don't want to have anything special with someone who talks to me informally.

313
1276
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,770
Did he take a class on how to talk to girls?

314
1280
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,080
That's something...

315
1284
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,010
- Please wash these, too.
- Okay.

316
1289
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,240
Ah, it's fine! I'll do it.

317
1293
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,350
I'm almost finished tying it.

318
1297
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,570
No, where did get the hair tie from?

319
1301
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,720
I brought it before work. I'm telling you, you look prettier with your hair to the side like this.

320
1305
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,850
What? I mean... When have you seen me with my hair on the side?

321
1309
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,520
I don't think that ever happened.

322
1313
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,820
Ah..I'm saying you probably look better with your hair like that.

323
1317
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,730
Tie your hair. Why would you hide your pretty neckline?

324
1321
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,580
<i>Did you get to work? How is that 1994 guy doing?</i>

325
1325
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,250
<i>Was he a bit surprised when you told him you were married?</i>

326
1329
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,830
<i>No, it doesn't seem like it at all.</i>

327
1333
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,460
<i>Why? Is he still flirting with you?</i>

328
1337
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,660
<i>I don't know whether it's flirting or just messing around.</i>

329
1341
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,900
<i>He even bought a hair tie and tied my hair up earlier.</i>

330
1345
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,350
<i>What?! Hey! Isn't that sexual harassment?</i>

331
1349
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,120
<i>This punk, how dare he?</i>

332
1353
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,860
<i>Pervert! I'll have to go there and teach him a lesson!</i>

333
1357
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,870
<i>- Ji Ho, wait for us.
- We'll go there.</i>

334
1362
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,790
Ah, I'm sorry...you told me to not include whipped cream. I forgot. I'll make another one.

335
1366
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:47,080
No, no! It's fine, I normally lose weight easily, so I'm fine.

336
1370
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,030
I'll enjoy it. I'll finish it all.

337
1374
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,050
As for you, lavender tea.

338
1378
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,000
It's hot, so be careful.

339
1382
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,100
Enjoy!

340
1386
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,810
Hey, you said it was sexual harassment and that you'll teach him a lesson.

341
1390
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:15,410
My friend, I feel like dating him would also be a great experience in life.

342
1394
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,290
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?

343
1398
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,520
Should I not get married?

344
1402
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,400
Suddenly, I feel like I didn't get to explore the world enough yet.

345
1406
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,350
What's wrong with you, too?

346
1410
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,010
- Thank you, Boss. 
- Thank you for the meal!

347
1415
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,690
It's fine. As a boss, I should at least do this for you.

348
1419
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,090
It wasn't even ₩1,000,000 ($1,000).

349
1423
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,300
As for the second round, it will be treated by Nam Se Hee!

350
1427
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,360
<i>- Wow! 
- Yeah!</i>

351
1432
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,420
Then let's go to Ji Ho's part-time job.

352
1436
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,420
The cake there's the best. It's known as the it-place around here.

353
1440
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,060
Okay. Let's go!

354
1444
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,240
Okay!! I love cake!

355
1448
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,160
You're going to buy us cake, right?

356
1452
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,800
- Hello. 
- Oh? Ji Ho!

357
1457
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,980
- Hello.
- Hello. 
- Hello, Sister-in-law.

358
1463
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,450
I'm here for the cake!

359
1467
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,290
- Ah, here's the cake! 
- Wow. It looks so delicious!

360
1472
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,440
Choux cream looks good.

361
1476
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,670
- This looks great.
- No, this one's better.

362
1481
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,450
Pick one.

363
1485
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,060
Which one is good? Se Hee's paying today.

364
1489
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,630
Ah, is that so?

365
1493
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,420
The ones that sell best are the cheesecake and chocolate cake.

366
1497
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,830
- I'll take blueberry cheesecake. 
- Like a man, I'll take chocolate mousse.

367
1502
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,160
- Then, I'll take a cheesecake. 
- Me too.

368
1507
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,270
- Are you ready to order? 
- Yes.

369
1512
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,760
We'll take seven Americanos.

370
1516
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,060
Aren't you going to order any cake?

371
1520
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,990
No, I'm not.

372
1524
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,030
Anyone who wants iced coffee?

373
1528
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,710
Is there none?

374
1532
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,670
Is your face not burning up [from embarrassment]?

375
1536
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:16,130
I mean, why can't you order a cake, just how expensive can it be?

376
1540
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,040
You have the highest salary in our company. I'm still embarrassed to death.

377
1544
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,300
Sadly, my expenses this month are also its highest.

378
1548
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,270
I will treat everyone to meat when I finally pay off all my loans. Beef.

379
1552
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,220
When will that be?

380
1556
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,390
2048.

381
1560
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,570
Will I even be able to chew up meat at that time?

382
1564
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,200
Do you think you'll be alive then?

383
1568
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,060
If it's 2048, then that's 31 years from now.

384
1572
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,470
Don't you have to be alive to pay everyone a meal?

385
1576
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,930
What is this?

386
1580
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,630
Freebies. I'm buying it for you.

387
1584
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,000
- Okay!
- That's great!
- I'll enjoy!

388
1590
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Our YOLO youngster has a good mindset.

389
1594
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,590
I'm personally curious, but

390
1598
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,950
by chance, is your family wealthy and affluent, with old money?

391
1602
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:12,930
No, I saw your motorcycle outside and that's something hard to buy with your own money.

392
1606
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,900
Are you perhaps a third-generation chaebol or something and training yourself here to be a successor?

393
1610
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,400
It's not something like that.

394
1614
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,800
Though I did have to move into a half-basement monthly rental, in order to buy that.

395
1618
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,230
Really? Then I guess you traded your house for that motorcycle.

396
1622
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,730
Wow. That's YOLO. You live your life coolly!

397
1626
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,460
I only live once, so I can't waste it paying off a mortgage.

398
1630
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,090
I think people who are called, "house poor" are a bit pathetic in my eyes.

399
1634
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,430
Well, not to the extent of pathetic.

400
1638
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,340
Everyone has different life goals, though.

401
1642
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,660
But that's not really a life goal, it's more of not taking care of your life.

402
1646
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,900
Just how can you sacrifice your whole life just for a house? You should try to enjoy every moment you can in your life.

403
1650
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,730
I guess you want to believe you're living every moment of your life in enjoyment.

404
1654
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:02,790
Since YOLO is a nihilist consumption pattern.

405
1658
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,970
Since you know you can't earn much, can't save much, can't accomplish much,

406
1662
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,630
you escape it with temporary consumption.

407
1666
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,630
Escaping?

408
1670
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,930
As expected, maybe because you studied more than me, your interpretations are unique.

409
1674
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:30,160
Then, you guys should all briefly escape by enjoy something sweet today.

410
1678
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,600
Enjoy!

411
1682
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,960
What a sweet type of guy.

412
1686
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,520
A sweet youngster he is. Sweet youngster!

413
1690
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,980
<i>- Okay, let's eat! 
- Enjoy!</i>

414
1695
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,830
I enjoyed it.

415
1699
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,830
I'll see you at home.

416
1703
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,690
Okay. Are you going to get off work late?

417
1707
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,870
No, if nothing happens, then I should get home in time.

418
1711
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,920
Okay. Then, I'll see you at home.

419
1715
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,480
Yes.

420
1719
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,530
Ah...Do <i>you</i> get off work late?

421
1723
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:10,430
Ah, well, same for me, if nothing happens...

422
1727
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,600
Why?

423
1731
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,340
No, just because...Goodbye.

424
1735
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,330
Work hard, Ji Ho.

425
1739
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,560
Goodbye!

426
1743
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:37,090
By any chance, does that YOLO guy have a girlfriend?

427
1747
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,910
I'm not sure. I don't think he does.

428
1751
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,530
- I'm leaving. 
- Yes.

429
1756
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,470
What are you going to do?

430
1760
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,300
What? About what?

431
1764
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,560
That YOLO guy seems to be interested in Ji Ho.

432
1768
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:08,450
Since they work together, isn't that something you should be concerned with?

433
1772
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,500
Why would I?

434
1776
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,100
Because you're her husband?

435
1780
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:18,150
Just because I'm her husband, it doesn't mean I have the rights to tell my wife how to live her social life.

436
1784
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,370
Anyway, that workplace is an environment chosen by her.

437
1788
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:25,130
Anything that happens there, is her own personal work life.

438
1792
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,850
Although I'm her husband, I have no rights to tell her what to do.

439
1796
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:33,180
I expected it, but your marriage seems exactly like you.

440
1800
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,870
Still, you should at least show her when you're jealous.

441
1804
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,930
Girls like it when their man gets jealous sometimes.

442
1808
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,240
Jealous?

443
1812
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,330
Are you talking about me?

444
1816
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:50,340
Yes, you were jealous. The whole entire time.

445
1820
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,000
I wasn't.

446
1824
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,040
Then why are you looking at the same thing again since earlier?

447
1828
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,400
You've been looking at the weather report for an hour now.

448
1832
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,570
When it comes to weather report, there is a lot to read.

449
1836
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,340
Ah, yes...

450
1840
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,190
What was that? That bad attitude just now?

451
1844
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,970
Please apologize, Bo Mi. Here the weather report.

452
1848
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,340
I'm not just looking at Korea's weather report, if you look at it right here...

453
1852
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,690
Okay, here.

454
1856
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:30,630
How can a man's dimple be that deep?

455
1860
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,810
He is really amazing.

456
1864
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,040
No, isn't he the total opposite from our brother-in-law?

457
1868
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,340
Extreme opposite from each other, including looks and lifestyle.

458
1872
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,040
If it were you, who would you choose?

459
1876
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,880
One is YOLO without a house and the other is house poor.

460
1880
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,740
Can I not choose?

461
1884
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,160
No, I mean if they were the last men on earth. Who would you choose?

462
1888
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,130
Why would I choose only one if they are the last two men  on earth? I will go back and forth sleeping with them.

463
1892
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,550
Pervert.

464
1896
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,100
So, how's it going with CEO Ma?

465
1900
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,040
What do you mean by that?

466
1904
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,650
I mean have you slept with him, are you going to sleep with him or are you sleeping with him? What's the verb tense?

467
1908
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,660
What are you talking about? We only have a work relationship.

468
1912
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,930
I see. I guess, instead of documents,

469
1916
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,710
you give toys at work. That's so adorable.

470
1920
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,830
He said that he had some coins and he got it for me.

471
1924
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,270
He gave it for me but I was going to throw it away.

472
1928
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,410
I see.

473
1932
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:41,090
If you were going to throw it away, why did you put seat belt on it?

474
1936
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:49,820
Also, he just gave it to you? It looks just like you.

475
1940
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,720
What do you mean by that?

476
1944
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,990
Do I look that ugly?

477
1948
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:58,910
What about Won Seok? Is everything okay?

478
1952
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,750
Of course. I'm paying everything back to him.

479
1956
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,140
Slowly, but painfully.

480
1960
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,800
What?

481
1964
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,370
<i>Oh my gosh. Some trouble came up from app users.</i>

482
1968
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,900
This guy met a woman by chat and stalked her.

483
1972
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,850
Where? Which company?

484
1976
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,450
Don't worry. It's not your CEO Ma's company.

485
1980
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,040
Heol!

486
1984
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,430
What?

487
1988
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:41,130
Day before yesterday, a man imprisoned a woman for thirteen hours in a studio apartment around Namgang station.

488
1992
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,600
It said that they met through a game app. It just appeared online.

489
1996
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,320
Won't our image suffer because of these things?

490
2000
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,990
You're right. People will just think that they met through an app.

491
2004
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,440
Shouldn't we be prepared and make a blacklist?

492
2008
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,750
I guess we need to come up with a list of potential people and come up with something.

493
2012
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:06,580
Bo Mi, you are taking care of the customer satisfaction issues?

494
2016
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,710
Was there anything special?

495
2020
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,750
There were 32 complaints this week.

496
2024
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,480
They were all complaints about the women not being very active in conversation.

497
2028
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,680
Even though we might not know, monitor them just in case.

498
2032
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,210
Also, if any complaints need to be follow-up, share them right away.

499
2036
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,390
Even if it looks like low risk.

500
2040
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,530
Okay. Then I'll share it with you.

501
2044
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,200
No. Don't tell me, tell CEO Ma.

502
2048
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,860
Customer satisfaction isn't my job.

503
2052
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,920
- Okay. 
<i>- Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

504
2057
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,660
Yes! Yes! Yes!

505
2061
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:53,950
Everyone. It seems like finally, we can launch a global office.

506
2065
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,860
Wow!

507
2069
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,630
Oh!

508
2073
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,140
- You secured an investment? 
- I was just on the phone with Deputy Park.

509
2078
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,730
Today, they are going to confirm it at the Golden Venture meeting.

510
2082
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,020
Deputy Park? The one who you want to send back to military to have him go through military service again?

511
2086
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,870
The Deputy Park you want to meet in India in your next life?

512
2090
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,330
That's right. If I was born as a chaebol in India in my next life,

513
2094
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,780
the same Deputy Park I wanted to order around as my sudra for the rest of my life.

514
2098
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,180
That Deputy Park. Oh, my world. Oh, my world!

515
2102
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,260
He is the college senior to Golden Venture's investment evaluator.

516
2106
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,790
- Great! 
- Then what's will happen?

517
2111
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,480
Deputy Park who's supposed to be your sudra in your next life.

518
2115
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,500
Deputy Park is someone I need to serve for the rest of my life as my

519
2119
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,140
Brahman. A Brahman!

520
2123
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,450
Then let's all say our slave version motto!

521
2127
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,320
- We, 
- We,

522
2132
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,290
- if we get paid, 
- do everything!

523
2137
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,140
Everyone should go home early. I'll go get the investment.

524
2141
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,950
I'm the man you should pick.

525
2145
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,710
- This is great! 
- This is amazing!

526
2150
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,110
Thank you.

527
2154
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,660
Come in.

528
2158
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,020
You came early.

529
2162
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,400
Congratulations for getting the investment.

530
2166
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,330
Yes. Thank you.

531
2170
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,510
Deputy Park worked hard for this.

532
2174
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,070
He's not that type of person who usually works hard like this.

533
2178
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:55,040
Being good at a job is more important than working hard.

534
2182
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,590
I worked as a deputy in Samsung Electronics, too.

535
2186
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,760
There's no one that is born as a CEO.

536
2190
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,670
Last time, I was being nosy, under the disguise of advising.

537
2194
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,660
You already apologized.

538
2198
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,170
Does that mean you have accepted the apology at that time?

539
2202
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,620
I misunderstood because you didn't reply back.

540
2206
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,170
Why are my text messages read but never replied to? Did it vanish into thin air?

541
2210
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,260
I was about to file a complaint to the text message company.

542
2214
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,450
But, you should accept an official apology.

543
2218
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,690
I'm sorry. I won't act like that ever again.

544
2222
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,760
Okay. Since the meeting is very important to you,

545
2226
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,280
don't say anything unprofessional and personal.

546
2230
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,970
What do you mean by personal? You mean by me liking you?

547
2234
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,830
I'm just joking.

548
2238
00:39:54,830 --> 00:40:01,090
I have been a CEO for three years. I am not the type to mess up my work based on personal feelings.

549
2242
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,410
Hello.

550
2246
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,660
<i>I'm on my way to get the investment by Golden Venture.</i>

551
2250
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,800
<i>I will be successful and help you get yours.</i>

552
2254
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,610
<i>Congraulations, Hyung. You will definitely succeed.</i>

553
2258
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:43,220
Wow. I definitely envy him.

554
2262
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,770
<i>End of Rang's ovulation, 7pm</i>

555
2266
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,360
Rang. Sang Goo went to secure his investment today.

556
2270
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,500
If he does well, he's going to help me.

557
2274
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,210
Really? That's good.

558
2278
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,560
Then, is Se Hee going to get a raise?

559
2282
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,630
Probably. Since he's a founding member.

560
2286
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,300
I think he has many shares.

561
2290
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,240
Oh, good for Ji Ho. She will become a madam before I do.

562
2294
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:37,520
Don't worry. When I succeed, I'll make sure you live in luxury. Kiss.

563
2298
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,030
Hey, I need to put on toner.

564
2302
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,230
You don't have to put it on.

565
2306
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,360
No. In autumn, I need to keep my skin moist.

566
2310
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:52,060
You know what's best for your skin.

567
2314
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,660
I know everything. Your ovulation ended today, right?

568
2318
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,590
How did you know?

569
2322
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:02,880
It ended yesterday.

570
2326
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,500
Go and get some condoms.

571
2330
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,240
I'm all ready.

572
2334
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,520
Rang, my friend made this. This is really popular.

573
2338
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,500
Let's use them.

574
2342
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,120
You have two of them, right?

575
2346
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,470
Are we going to do it twice?

576
2350
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,590
This pervert.

577
2354
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,720
Okay. Two times.

578
2358
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,630
No. I mean, wear them both.

579
2362
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,830
Why should I wear them both?

580
2366
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:43,740
I've read that condom has failure rate of 15% in preventing pregnancies.

581
2370
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:52,570
Let's see. If there is 10% chance to get pregnant during non pregnancy phase. 15 times 10 is 150.

582
2374
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,900
If we divide it, the possibility of getting pregnant is 1.5%.

583
2378
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,400
With that 1.5%, can you make sure that I won't get pregnant?

584
2382
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,490
Rang, when did you calculate that?

585
2386
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:09,320
And also, why did you wear those glasses?

586
2390
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:16,270
Since you don't want to have kids nor get married, we have to take all the precautions.

587
2394
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:21,890
So from now on, wear them both. Let's be thorough.

588
2398
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,030
CEO, have a glass.

589
2402
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,860
Oh. Okay.

590
2406
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,570
I read your investment proposal.

591
2410
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:46,590
Chief Yoon spoke so highly of it, so I asked him to just show me for a review.

592
2414
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,670
In such a short time, you made your company grow.

593
2418
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,570
- The profit outlook seems good.
 - Thank you for being your positive reviews.

594
2423
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:58,420
Chief Yoon, thank you. I will pour you a glass.

595
2427
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:02,480
Oh my, my senior really pushed for Gyeolmalae

596
2431
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,400
I listen to everything Jin Woo said.

597
2435
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:11,240
Oh, Chief Yoon. You make it sound like you are investing based on personal connections.

598
2439
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,160
This is all because CEO Jang has a very discerning eye for investments.

599
2443
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,370
I admit to that but,

600
2447
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,930
I hope that I'm right this time.

601
2451
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:26,320
Of course. It's without a doubt.

602
2455
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,900
Tinkle, tinkle. (<i>bells are used by fortune tellers</i>)

603
2459
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,380
Here. Let's have a drink.

604
2463
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,030
- Okay. 
 -Here.

605
2468
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,600
Oh, this is nice.

606
2472
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,800
- That's good. 
- Thank you.

607
2477
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:58,470
Once you secure this investment, will you set up a global office?

608
2481
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:03,410
Yes. We are ready. We just need the investment.

609
2485
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:07,780
That was my goal when I first started.

610
2489
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,360
You know I followed CEO Jang all the way to Thailand, right?

611
2493
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
- It was on the weekend. 
- I heard.

612
2498
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,400
I heard that you played golf for four days and even suffered a second degree sunburn from it.

613
2502
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,010
Yeah. Do you think I followed him there to play golf for my sake?

614
2506
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,660
It's all to push for Gyeolmalrae, of course.

615
2510
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,790
The talks you throw out in the middle of fielding is very important. You know what, CEO Ma.

616
2514
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,790
Of course. Those talks are truly very important.

617
2518
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,880
Oh. Right.

618
2522
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,930
I can drop the honorific speech, right? Since we're similar in age.

619
2526
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,690
Or does that discomfort you?

620
2530
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:42,090
How is that? How's that discomforting?

621
2534
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,380
Don't people talk like friends if it's only three years in age difference?

622
2538
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,580
Right, Sang Goo? It's Sang Goo then.

623
2542
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,120
Sang Goo!

624
2546
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,250
I think you'll need a beating from Sang Goo.

625
2550
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:06,340
The ambiance is so great today. What were you talking about?

626
2554
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,210
Oh, I was hearing about the golf trip the three of them went on.

627
2558
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,530
I see. Golf.

628
2562
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,640
Deputy Woo, what did you do during the break?

629
2566
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:16,510
I just rested at the hotel.

630
2570
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:17,780
Hotel?

631
2574
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,630
Where?

632
2578
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,540
Namsan.

633
2582
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:23,010
Oh. Gaya Hotel?

634
2586
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:26,520
That's a great place. They have a great view, too.

635
2590
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,310
And great for lovers to get in the mood, too.

636
2594
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,020
Who would you have gone with?

637
2598
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,390
I went by myself.

638
2602
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,230
I just wanted to rest comfortably this year.

639
2606
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:38,480
No way. Not you, Deputy Woo.

640
2610
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,580
I really went alone.

641
2614
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,220
Let's be honest. Tell me honestly.

642
2618
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,150
You went with your boyfriend, right?

643
2622
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,700
Mischievous.  You're so mischievous!

644
2626
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,420
This crazy psycho bastard. Seriously.

645
2630
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,510
What era does he think he lives in?

646
2634
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,360
He is asking for a beating now.

647
2638
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,810
CEO Ma. What? Why are you doing that?

648
2642
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:12,780
Oh, I'm sorry.

649
2646
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,610
I think I spoke too loud to myself.

650
2650
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,750
This junior punk of mine is talking too much crap in his text.

651
2654
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:20,580
So I was a bit riled up. Sorry. I'm sorry.

652
2658
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,390
I'm sorry.

653
2662
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,680
Deputy Woo. Let's just talk honestly now.

654
2666
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,510
You have a boyfriend but you're just acting like you don't, right?

655
2670
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,550
Hey, why do you hide that stuff between us?

656
2674
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,460
Why would I hide it?

657
2678
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,060
Yea, go ahead.

658
2682
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:45,110
I want to hear about how the young people date these days, too.

659
2686
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:48,850
This bastard just can't be helped.

660
2690
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:52,970
Act like your age if you're old, you bastard.

661
2694
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,910
Want me to make you a cripple now?

662
2698
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:59,550
Get you a big beating on your hands and wrist? Bastard.

663
2702
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:08,830
I'm sorry. I look pretty and all but I've got a hot temperament.

664
2706
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,970
So if I don't fix his habit of that junior bastard of mine,

665
2710
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:16,040
I think I might regret forever. That's why.

666
2714
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

667
2718
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,550
I'm sorry!

668
2722
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,940
Se Hee. Get in. Kyeong Yeong drove his car today.

669
2726
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,040
No, it's alright. I'll just take the bus.

670
2730
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,620
Get in, Se Hee.

671
2734
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,340
It's on my way anyway, so I'll drop you off in front of your home.

672
2738
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,670
Oh.

673
2742
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,480
Good job.

674
2746
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,110
Thank you for your trouble.

Noona!

681
2774
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,950
So disloyal! To leave work first while I was out making delivery?

682
2778
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,230
Get on.

683
2782
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,640
No, it's alright. I'm taking the bus.

684
2786
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,870
I know. You're sitting at the bus stop.

685
2790
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,620
Oh. I am.

686
2794
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,740
What? By chance, was your husband going to come pick you up?

687
2798
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,540
Oh, nothing like that.

688
2802

If it's not like that, get on. I'm faster than the bus.

♫ <i>Stay with me </i> ♫

690
2810
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:33,450
I mean, what's with the mindset of fussing on taking the bus?

691
2814
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,540
What mindset? It's just that he's got a crappy personality.

692
2818
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,920
Drop me off up front over there.

693
2822
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,500
Oh, alright.

694
2826
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,910
But why are you going to Itaewon suddenly?

695
2830
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,030
Meeting friends?

696
2834
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:51,250
Nope. Just a meeting with myself, shall I say?

697
2838
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,560
See you tomorrow.

698
2842
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,620
Bye, Bo Mi.

699
2846
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,020
CEO Jang, I'm sorry about today.

700
2850
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,500
I got it. Work hard.

701
2854
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,720
Good bye.

702
2858
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:14,220
CEO Ma. So you've got a talent to ruin a pot of rice that's all done.

703
2862
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,550
I wouldn't have.

704
2866
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm sorry.

705
2870
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,600
I think it'll be hard for us to meet for a while.

706
2874
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,090
Going global? Yeah, right!

707
2878
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:28,040
Good bye.

708
2882
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,290
<i>You called for a driver?</i>

709
2886
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,100
Yes.

710
2890
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,680
Let's go.

711
2894
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:50,000
Why did you do that?

712
2898
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:57,900
You said it was an important meeting and you weren't going to respond with personal feelings.

713
2902
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,800
You said that.

714
2906
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:05,320
I didn't do that on personal feelings, it was a public feeling.

715
2910
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,240
I am mindful of you no matter where I go.

716
2914
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,910
And I'm curious about you.

717
2918
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:13,120
So then, I miss you.

718
2922
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,470
Those are public feelings.

719
2926
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,010
- Look here, CEO Ma— 
- I just don't like it!

720
2931
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:24,210
Those bastards harassing you!

721
2935
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,820
I barely kept myself from flying my fist at them.

722
2939
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,670
So, please.

723
2943
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,180
Could you just not say anything to me today?

724
2947
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,530
I mean, they are the ones who did wrong.

725
2951
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:42,330
So why are you acting like this just to me?

726
2955
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:51,240
So cute.

727
2959
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,230
You look like a baby when you smile,

728
2963
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,720
when you usually look scary.

729
2967
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,240
This is . . .

730
2971
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,430
The place we came before. Room 303.

731
2975
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:45,420
Oh. You said you don't remember, right?

732
2979
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,540
Driver. Could you make a stop here?

733
2983
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,570
I'm sorry. You find your way home from here.

734
2987
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,960
What?

735
2991
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,170
What now? Did I do something wrong again?

736
2995
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:12,350
Nope.

737
2999
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,020
It's because I feel like I will do something wrong.

738
3003
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,690
What?

739
3007
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:21,250
If we continue to stay together, I think I might jump you.

740
3011
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,790
What?

741
3015
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:30,340
Oh, also, it wasn't number 303. It was 304—our room.

742
3019
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,210
What the heck!

743
3023
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,870
So she remembered.

744
3027
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:49,850
Wow, she's a complete fox.

745
3031
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,980
The sky is nice.

746
3035
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,540
Look at the micro-dust.

747
3039
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:20,540
What is it?

748
3043
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,240
What else? Dating location.

749
3047
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,010
What?

750
3051
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,630
Stop frowning. I'm joking.

751
3055
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,310
Come here.

752
3059
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,930
See? I told you, it's great.

753
3063
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:47,520
It's been a while since you've done something like this, right?

754
3067
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,460
Yeah..

755
3071
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:54,550
It been years since I've seen

756
3075
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,160
Seoul's night skyline.

757
3079
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,820
Isn't it wrong that you've only seen this after years, even though you just got married?

758
3083
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:04,580
Don't you go on date with your husband?

759
3087
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:09,030
Ah, well... We do...

760
3091
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:13,030
Like what? Drinking beers at home? Watching TV?

761
3095
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,750
Or drinking beers at home while watching TV?

762
3099
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,720
Hey, Bok Nam.

763
3103
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,140
Yes?

764
3107
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,560
At first, I thought that you were just messing around.

765
3111
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,990
You are younger than my brother,

766
3115
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:38,060
so I just saw you as cute.

767
3119
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:42,400
However, I don't think I can continue thinking that you're messing around.

768
3123
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:48,620
It's pretty, the night view

769
3127
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,110
and your heart for bringing me here.

770
3131
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,080
However, it's supposed to feel pretty,

771
3135
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,870
and happy,

772
3139
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,850
but it doesn't feel that way.

773
3143
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:09,790
I'm starting to feel uncomfortable around you.

774
3147
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:14,080
Is it because of your husband?

775
3151
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,130
No.

776
3155
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:21,030
It's because of me.

777
3159
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:28,330
These actions of yours, whether they are just kindness or light joking,

778
3163
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:33,360
either way, I'm a married person now,

779
3167
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,430
so it makes me uncomfortable.

780
3171
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:42,030
Even looking at this beautiful night view,

781
3175
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,940
my heart feels uncomfortable.

782
3179
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,370
Then... What if you weren't married?

783
3183
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:59,730
Then would it look pretty? The night view?

784
3187
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:05,080
And would my effort make you happy, too?

785
3191
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,780
Yes.

786
3195
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,530
I would've probably been happy right now.

787
3199
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:14,310
If I wasn't married.

788
3203
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:20,780
How can I not be happy when a young, handsome man took me out

789
3207
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,350
to look at this beautiful night view?

790
3211
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,230
Young, handsome man?

791
3215
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:32,950
You know it, too, even without me telling you that you're young and handsome.

792
3219
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:36,780
It's written all over your face,

793
3223
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,490
"I know I'm handsome",

794
3227
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:42,240
"I'm handsome, right?", and stuff like that.

795
3231
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,910
I-It's that obvious?

796
3235
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,170
Yes.

797
3239
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,660
Then, I'm sure it got a bit annoying at times.

798
3243
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,220
A bit.

799
3247
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,970
I guess it is obvious...

805
3271
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:48,030
I made a delivery to a bookstore and bought it thinking of you.

806
3275
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:51,300
I heard that writers read a lot, right?

807
3279
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,930
Ah...I heard from our boss that you were a former scriptwriter.

808
3283
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:01,560
Do you like this writer? This is from one of my favorite writers.

809
3287
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,020
I don't know since I don't read a lot.

810
3291
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,870
I just bought it because the cover looked pretty.

811
3295
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:11,070
I didn't read a lot nor did I study a lot either.

812
3299
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:13,320
I was just simple like that.

813
3303
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,990
So, don't find me uncomfortable.

814
3307
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:20,750
I know what you were trying to say today.

815
3311
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:24,220
I didn't have any serious intentions, honestly.

816
3315
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,960
I just found you, the noona that I work with, cute and easy.

817
3319
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,100
I just wanted to get close to you by drinking out together and look at the night view after work.

818
3323
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:34,960
Easy?

819
3327
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,920
You know that well without me telling you that you're easy and cute.

820
3331
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,160
Revenge?

821
3335
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,430
Yeah, revenge.

822
3339
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,890
Okay. Then after work, we can go grab a beer together from now on.

823
3343
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:59,020
I'll speak informally to you now, since I'm an easy noona.

824
3347
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,320
See you tomorrow.

825
3351
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,300
But if you leave after changing so suddenly...

826
3355
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,360
- Oh, you're home?
- Yes.

827
3360
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,240
- Kitty...
- Kitty puked again.

828
3365
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,090
- Did you take her to the hospital yet? 
- No, not yet, because of the company.

829
3370
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,830
I guess I must take her tomorrow then.

830
3374
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:31,450
If you're busy, then I'll take her.

831
3378
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,860
I can talk to Bok Nam and ask to change my working time.

832
3382
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,790
I'll take her.

833
3386
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,770
It's fine.

834
3390
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:44,230
It's not something that was written in our contract, so you don't have to do that.

835
3394
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:47,920
I will just use my lunch time.

836
3398
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,840
Okay.

837
3402
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,330
Today...

838
3406
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,060
Did you get home from the bus?

839
3410
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:04,530
What?

840
3414
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:09,140
Did you get home using the bus?

841
3418
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,190
Ah...

842
3422
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,540
However, do I have to answer that?

843
3426
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:27,430
It is not necessary to.

844
3430
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,390
I agree.

845
3434
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:57,690
<i>- You must just got home.
- Yes.</i>

846
3439
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:01,810
<i>Ah, I just dropped her off since it's dangerous to walk alone at night.</i>

847
3443
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:10,010
<i>Since it's dangerous, please don't take her home anymore.</i>

848
3447
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:13,760
<i>- Pardon?
- Since it might be more dangerous with you taking her home,</i>

849
3452
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,700
<i>I'm telling you to not do it anymore.</i>

850
3456
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:19,790
<i>Why not? Do I seem like a dangerous person?</i>

851
3460
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:26,520
<i>Because I have nothing to accomplish, so I'm escaping? </i>

852
3464
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,430
<i>I guess what I said made you very uncomfortable.</i>

853
3468
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:32,440
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

854
3472
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,570
<i>I'm just saying that a motorcycle could be more dangerous.</i>

855
3476
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:39,090
<i>It's my choice to take her home using my motorcycle, not yours.</i>

856
3480
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:40,860
<i>No.</i>

857
3484
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:45,330
<i>It's not yours nor mine, it's Ji Ho's choice.</i>

858
3488
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:49,870
<i>What rights do we have to decide what type of transportation she takes?</i>

859
3492
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,990
<i>I am just merely giving my opinion.</i>

860
3496
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:57,900
<i>Since she can't say "no" easily,</i>

861
3500
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:03,050
<i>I hope that you don't tell her to get on first.</i>

862
3504
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:16,090
<i>I guess it's really because you studied a lot. Your logic is top-notch. </i>

863
3508
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:28,600
<i>But I'm different from you in that I didn't study a lot and I'm illogical. </i>

864
