Yes, I did.

15
62
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,960

Yes.

Why?

23
94
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,270
Yes?

24
98
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,920
Why are you following me?

25
102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,070
It's not that I'm following you.

26
106
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,370
I didn't know.

27
110
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,680
Yes. I thought so.

28
114
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,540
Well, take a shower.

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,800
He seems to be the suspect in the Namgang Station case.

33
134
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,460
The stalker of that female college student?

34
138
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,640
The report content is similar and also, the spanner (wrench).

35
142
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,120
But, why didn't you say anything to me?

36
146
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,800
Didn't you know all along?

37
150
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,790
You said it was a job that was difficult for you to get.

38
154
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,750
I couldn't let you know recklessly.

39
158
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,370
Still, if you had given me a clue

40
162
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,720
then I could have acted like I didn't know and kept a watch on him.

41
166
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,500
You? Act like you didn't know?

42
170
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,960
Why?

43
174
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,870
Do I look like I can't do that?

44
178
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,660
<i>I overreacted a bit. So from now on, saying 'us' too easily,</i>

45
182
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,790
<i>please stop.</i>

46
186
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,310
<i>Did you come home on the bus?</i>

47
190
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,320
<i> Do I have to answer that?</i>

48
194
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,020
<i>Well, you don't need to.</i>

49
198
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,190
<i>Exactly.</i>

50
202
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,890
That person seemed to know about our contract?

51
206
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,560
Yes.

52
210
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,230
He definitely said 'fake husband.'

53
214
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,210
<i>Who told you to get married to a fake husband?</i>

54
218
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,300
Even if he stalked me, how could he know that?

55
222
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,460
You're right.

56
226
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,750
No one knows that besides the two of us.

57
230
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,030
Ah, is it because of my cellphone?

58
234
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,900
What?

59
238
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,490
He saw what I saved you as on my cell phone.

60
242
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,520
He said, instead of your husband, isn't he your landlord?

61
246
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,930
Yes.

62
250
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,410
You saved me as "Landlord."

63
254
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,160
That's certainly unusual.

64
258
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,630
So why did you save my number as "Landlord?"

65
262
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,230
Then what would I save you as?

66
266
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,930
Well, there's nothing else I can call you.

67
270
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,730
Well, there is my name.

68
274
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,950
Like Se Hee or Se Hee-ssi.

69
278
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,280
Then Se Hee-ssi, what did you save me as?

70
282
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,030
Obviously, I saved you as

71
286
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,990
"Tenant."

72
290
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,480
Bo Mi's uncle works at the precinct and we've let him know.

73
294
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,710
So it should be resolved by tomorrow or so.

74
298
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,120
Then what will happen to Bok Nam?

75
302
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,950
He will have to eat rice and beans (go to jail).

76
306
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,380
Yes.

77
310
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,420
<i>Oh, it's passed through. Now, Sanchez.</i>

78
314
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,240
<i>It's going in!</i>

79
318
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,520
He put it in nice and square.

80
322
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,470
Indeed! Sanchez!

81
326
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,480
<i>Yes, Sanchez came out fierce.</i>

82
330
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,850
<i>We've had a few misfires so far, </i>

83
334
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,080
<i>but this was a perfect through goal. The tempo was perfect.</i>

84
338
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Thank you,

85
342
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,280
for running to me,

86
346
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,200
and coming down from there with me.

87
350
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,620
Also...

88
354
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,050
For saying 'our home.'

89
358
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,330
Were you really disappointed?

90
362
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,020
That line I drew?

91
366
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,510
For asking not to act like a married couple in front of others,

92
370
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:00,510
and for asking not to say 'us' as well,

93
374
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,440
were you hurt by that?

94
378
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,540
Yes.

95
382
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,430
But I . . .

96
386
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,210
don't wish to be a hindrance to you.

97
390
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,220
Different from others, we entered into marriage with a plan for it to end.

98
394
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,010
For you, it's a boarding space and for me, it's the benefit of monthly rent.

99
398
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,810
Though we entered into a contract that was agreed to by both,

100
402
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,780
after the marriage ends

101
406
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,860
it's likely that you will suffer a bigger loss than me.

102
410
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,150
You're a woman,

103
414
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,300
and you're younger than me,

104
418
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:53,310
so the social judgment against you could be harsher.

105
422
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,120
Hence, all links to me should be kept to a minimum.

106
426
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,600
And any events shared by both of us . . .

107
430
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,830
I thought it would be right to avoid them as much as possible.

108
434
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,460
So you've been thinking those thoughts?

109
438
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,080
About the aftermath of our marriage end,

110
442
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,770
and also of the losses I might suffer?

111
446
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,110
Rather than that I've been thinking of them continuously.

112
450
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,770
It was that the thought occurred to me, right after our wedding.

113
454
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,290
Why?

114
458
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,450
Because I made a promise

115
462
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,790
that I would not be a hindrance to you.

116
466
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,070
I made a promise to your mother.

117
470
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,010
So I wanted to keep it.

118
474
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,610
And I want to continue to keep it in the future as well.

119
478
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,840
<i>Though I still don't know Ji Ho that well either,</i>

120
482
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:06,230
<i>she's someone who would always choose the road to her own happiness on her own. </i>

121
486
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,990
<i>And during our marriage, that choice . . .</i>

122
490
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,950
<i>I will not be a hindrance to it.</i>

123
494
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,830
<i>What I can promise you is only this.</i>

124
498
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,540
<i>Landlord</i>

125
502
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,040
<i>Calling Landlord</i>

126
506
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,900
He-ll-o?

127
510
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,320
It's me.

128
514
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,180
Yes, I know.

129
518
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,760
I . . .

130
522
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:59,330
After I graduated and got hired as an assistant writer,

131
526
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,280
I received 800 thousand won a month ($800).

132
530
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,980
Back then, my dad told me to quit right away and come down to Namhae.

133
534
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,820
He told me to harvest spinach.

134
538
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,820
At the field near our home,

135
542
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,450
if I picked spinach for just a week

136
546
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,600
I'd earn more than that, he said.

137
550
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,510
<i>The job that no one could understand.</i>

138
554
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,080
<i>The reason that I could begin working was that</i>

139
558
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,380
I had no thoughts.

140
562
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,770
Like becoming a great writer,

141
566
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,540
or becoming famous,

142
570
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,800
to succeed.

143
574
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,050
I had no such thoughts at all.

144
578
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,980
I just somehow ended up reading a script,

145
582
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,320
and it was crazily interesting to me.

146
586
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,300
So that's how I just started.

147
590
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,060
Because writing day after day was fun for me, that's why.

148
594
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,480
<i>Through writing, to achieve something or become something,</i>

149
598
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,330
<i>I had no thoughts of such things.</i>

150
602
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,790
<i>That's why I, </i>

151
606
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,720
regarding what might happen two years later,

152
610
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,820
I don't think of that.

153
614
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,530
If I had thought that far

154
618
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,340
I probably couldn't have done this, this marriage.

155
622
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,000
<i>To me,</i>

156
626
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,920
<i>I just needed this room right now.</i>

157
630
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,850
<i>And I liked the safety of this home.</i>

158
634
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,210
<i>And I didn't want to part from Kitty.</i>

159
638
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,510
<i>And also,</i>

160
642
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,080
the landlord seemed trustworthy.

161
646
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,100
So that's why I did it.

162
650
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,140
<i>Because I liked the fact of belonging to this home now.</i>

163
654
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,580
So the stuff that might happen after the marriage ends,

164
658
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,140
it doesn't matter to me and I don't think of it.

165
662
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,160
<i>So now,</i>

166
666
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,650
purposefully drawing a line...

167
670
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,660
Please don't.

168
674
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,410
Yes.

169
678
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,480
And your room door,

170
682
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,750
don't lock it.

171
686
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,190
Yes.

172
690
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,080
Then,

173
694
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,850
sleep well.

174
698
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,440
<i>I have something to say, too.</i>

175
702
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,050
Landlord. Please don't call me that.

176
706
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,220
<i>You could be misunderstood as being alone.</i>

177
710
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,150
In front of others, call me your husband.

178
714
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,710
<i>A dangerous situation could happen again. So that you won't be misunderstood as being alone,</i>

179
718
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,580
for two years along with me,

180
722
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,130
you belong to this home.

181
726
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,660
Yes.

182
730
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,740
Yes.

183
734
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,380
Then, goodnight.

184
738
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,290
But how did you know I was there?

185
742
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,810
You couldn't call me either.

So you were home. Then, why did you call again?

229
921
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,770
Oh. That's . . .

230

Oh.

I see.

Oh.

Kitty. How are you here?

239
961
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,190
She took a cab and came by herself.

240
965
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:58,370
She was crying for me to open the door from outside so I did.

241
969
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,010
She's got that kind of skill?

242
973
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,880
She doesn't, of course.

243
977
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,910
Since that was a joke.

244
981
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,470
So it was joking that you did.

245
985
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,550
Yes.

246
989
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,740
Yup, it's Ji Ho. What's happened, this early on?

247
993
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,610
Yes, Bo Mi. News? I didn't see it.

248
997
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,580

249

Oh.

250
1005
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,530
He's been caught?

253
1017
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,990
<i>The suspect stalked a woman he met in an online game and kidnapped her.</i>

254
1021
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,650
<i>And he's been suspected of keeping her confined for 13 hours.</i>

255
1025
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:10,040
<i>The police are conducting an investigation into additional suspected crimes upon his arrest. </i>

256
1029
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,430
I still can't believe it.

257
1033
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:17,050
I never thought he would be this kind of a kid.

258
1037
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,040
We ourselves don't even know ourselves, so how could we know about the dark sides of others?

259
1041
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,440
Will you be alright to go to work today?

260
1045
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,760
The police could come to the cafe, too.

261
1049
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,690
It's alright. The suspect's been arrested so I need to go and work.

262

264

Yes.

265
1065
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,870
Then, see you later.

266
1069
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,590
Yes.

267
1073
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,180
Oh my world, that rascal Bok Nam. Ji Ho, are you hurt anywhere?

268
1077
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:07,560
Nope, I'm fine. Before it got dangerous, the land—

269
1081
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,170

270

my husband

271
1089
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,690
came to get me.

272
1093
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,230
That's what I'm saying. I heard it from Soo Ji.

273
1097
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,610
I mean, Brother-in-law is really awesome.

274
1101
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,980
We all fell over for that smile but how did he gather all that data?

275
1105
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,320
I know. At the time I didn't even know

276
1109
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,380
he had gathered all the evidence.

277
1113
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,740
<i>He's really detailed and thorough.</i>

278
1117
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,460
Seok might be right after all. He said not anyone can solve the cube.

279
1121
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,810
He's got the new record for the cube, I heard. At his company.

280
1125
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,150
Yeah, he's capable of something like that.

281
1129
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,960
He's someone very thorough who doesn't tolerate a mistake.

282
1133
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,400
Daebak! Fifty-two seconds.

283
1137
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,510
Wow!

284
1141
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,110
Indeed. Se Hee. He's the god of the cube.

285
1145
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,750
This is nonsense. This is amazing.

286
1149
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,540
Wow. How did he do this?

287
1153
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,460
I've never seen this before.

288
1157
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,110
Wow, is he human?

289
1161
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,140
I don't think he is.

290
1165
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,140
Chief Nam, if you're done, could you see me for a sec? For work.

291
1169
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,160
So did you do something to that kid yesterday?

292
1173
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,710
Nothing too severe, right?

293
1177
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,150
You didn't hit him, did you?

294
1181
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,910
Do I seem like someone who would hit a person?

295
1185
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,250
That's a relief.

296
1189
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,010
Instead,

297
1193
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,920
I hit his motorcycle.

298
1197
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,640
- Hit what? 
- The ₩40 million one?

299
1202
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,540
Well, though it's ₩40 million, it was knocked down with one blow.

300
1206
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,260
And furthermore, I didn't even put too much power into it.

301
1210
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,170
Why are you looking at me with those eyes?

302
1214
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,930
It's true. I didn't use my full power.

303
1218
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,830
I called and told you this morning though, that they caught the suspect.

304
1222
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,840
Yes. I saw the news, too.

305
1226
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,350
Look at this.

306
1230
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,630
I got this by asking my uncle the favor. The perpetrator's photo.

307
1234
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,460
I looked at the account of the reported list and the account was under a stolen identity.

308
1238
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,490
- What? 
- You saw it too though.

309
1243
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,820

00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:03,020
<i>He acted like he was Yeon Bok Nam and approached the women. He's a total repeat offender.</i>

313
1259
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:09,530
Then . . . He's what?

314
1263
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,560
He's just a diligent part-timer.

315
1267
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,150
And a good citizen, too.

316
1271
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,600
You! Why are you not in jail and you're eating toast here?

317
1275
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,620
Yesterday, your husband wrecked his motorcycle, I hear.

318
1279
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,570
- What? 
- He kicked the motorcycle that was nicely parked and broke it!

319
1284
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,490
Well, Boss. That's because . . .

320
1288
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:52,430
He's a stalker.

321
1292
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,770
What? A stalker?

322
1296
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,670
Yes. He's the suspect in the Namgang Station case.

323
1300
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,320
Did he break out of jail so fast?

324
1304
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,740
Boss. I think we need to call the police right away first.

325
1308
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,630
Ji Ho? I think this is too much.

326
1312
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,960
He's a good kid and you say he's a criminal? Stalker?

327
1316
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,980
So that's the main point! He looks perfectly fine.

328
1320
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,970
- Look here, seriously! 
- It's alright. Stop, Dad.

329
1325
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,600
Who is he to tell him to stop?

330
1329
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,980
Dad?!

331
1333
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,760
Call your husband. Immediately!

332
1337
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,350
What? Namgang Station suspect?

333
1341
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,950
I'm sorry. I think there's been an error.

334
1345
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,340
If there's an error, you undo it by talking.

335
1349
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,900
A grown-up adult goes and breaks the kid's bike? That expensive one?!

336
1353
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,160
- I'm sorry. 
- I'm sorry.

337
1358
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,670
Do you know what motorcycle that is? It's the motorcycle that he took his rent deposit out to buy!

338
1362
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,490
When you look perfectly normal.

339
1366
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,510
Yes?

340
1370
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,200
I was going to settle it quietly too, but once my dad's angry no one can stop him.

341
1374
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,350
Oh. But I didn't tell him that—about the fake marriage.

342
1378
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,630
How did you know?

343
1382
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,330
Great Day Banquet Hall. You went there on the bus, right?

344
1386
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,790
Usually, people don't go to their own wedding riding a bus.

345
1390
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,810
I mean, a normal couple.

346
1394
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:02,780
<i>When I first saw you on the bus, I thought it was kind of funny and I just let it pass.</i>

347
1398
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,820
<i>By chance, do you think you will need a handkerchief?</i>

348
1402
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,720
<i>When the bride cries the groom should wipe it with a handkerchief.</i>

349
1406
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,560
<i>What? Me, cry? Why? I'm not that kind of a character.</i>

350
1410
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,290
<i>Yes, and that's such a relief.</i>

351
1414
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:23,480
<i>Oh, and I will pay for half of your wedding wear cost.</i>

352
1418
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,920
<i>Oh, no, it wasn't much anyway.</i>

353
1422
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,380
<i>But the more I listened, the stranger your conversation became. </i>

354
1426
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:35,380
<i>But different from me, you had to get wedding shoes and the bouquet, too, so I'll take it off on next month's rent. </i>

355
1430
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,680
<i>Thank you.</i>

356
1434
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,980
<i>Bus #4461</i>

357
1438
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:52,230
<i>What? Today? I have an evening part-time job today.</i>

358
1442
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,050
<i>But you got off right in front of the banquet hall where I work as a part-timer. </i>

359
1446
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,830
<i>Bok Nam, can you get the announcement stand in the waiting lounge set up? </i>

360
1450
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,750
<i>Yes. </i>

361
1454
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,990
<i>Pardon me.</i>

362
1458
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,580
<i>Yes.</i>

363
1462
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,130
<i>- I'm sorry. 
- Yes. </i>

364
1467
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,620
<i>So I had thought. "This bride and groom aren't ordinary." </i>

365
1471
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,090
<i>For example, a contract marriage?</i>

366
1475
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,790
<i>Thanks everyone. </i>

367
1479
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,900
<i>Thank you.</i>

368
1483
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,900
<i>Thank you, Bo Mi.</i>

369
1487
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,160
<i>- Thank you. 
- You should take one more picture.</i>

370
1492
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,140
<i>- What? 
- Our banquet hall offers a complimentary frame.</i>

371
1497
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,490
<i>- You should take a picture for the frame. 
- It's alright.</i>

372
1502
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,960
<i>Complimentary? Then we should. Stand again. Hurry. </i>

373
1506
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,890
<i>I think you should do a pose?</i>

374
1510
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,020
<i>I saw that there weren't any tender ones.</i>

375
1514
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,620
<i>Really?</i>

376
1518
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,000
<i>Se Hee, put on a different pose.</i>

377
1522
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,580
<i>By different pose, you mean? </i>

378
1526
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,050
<i>- Like a kiss.
 - What? </i>

379
1531
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,790
<i>Or hugging the bride's waist.</i>

380
1535
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,800
<i>It's a wedding photo. What is that? So weak.</i>

381
1539
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,280
<i>In that case, they will blame the photographer every time they see their photos.</i>

382
1543
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,840
<i>The two of you, put on some pose, whatever it is.</i>

383
1547
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,080
<i>Just do some kind of physical contact.</i>

384
1551
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,790
<i>Okay. It's much more tender. Right?</i>

385
1555
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,050
<i>Sure. A hand-shake is physical contact.</i>

386
1559
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,110
<i>I'm taking it now.</i>

387
1563
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,910
Then, how did you know about my signature?

388
1567
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:13,000
You did it when you settled with the banquet bill.

389
1571
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,580
<i>Nam Se Hee.</i>

390
1575
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,770
- Oh. 
- Right.

391
1580
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,070
But what about the spanner then?

392
1584
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,640
Yeah.

393
1588
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,060
Wow.

394
1592
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,620
I was going to open the beer bottle for you! Since I didn't have a bottle opener.

395
1596
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,610
Maybe you should share a moment of daytime drinking. The fake husband and wife fraud team.

396
1600
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,270
No. The kick threatening ring duo?

397
1604
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,320
That . . .

398
1608
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,610
And the motorcycle repair cost. I'll send it to you by tomorrow.

399
1612
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:15,940
Yes. The motorcycle.

400
1616
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,550
Um. Young Boy Bok Nam?

401
1620
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:37,010
No, Mister Bok Nam. No, Dearest Son.

402
1624
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,190
You came early today. You're only working in the morning?

403
1628
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,970
Yeah, we need a day like this too.

404
1632
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,260
<i>Are you going to the persimmon and pear gathering today?</i>

405
1636
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,460
Persimmon and pear gathering?

406
1640
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,560
<i>Oh, the high school reunion meeting? Of course. Isn't it also a meeting for Soo Jin's invitation?</i>

407
1644
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,960
<i>Yup. What about Ji Ho?</i>

408
1648
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,870
<i>Ji Ho's coming too.</i>

409
1652
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,590
Unni. Something colorful today.

410
1656
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,170
- Will it be alright? 
- I'm off tomorrow, so it's fine.

411
1661
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,680
- You're here? 
- Sorry.

412
1666
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,660
I'm sorry. You must have waited a long time.

413
1670
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,170
It's alright. It's cold, right?

414
1674
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,690
But how did it go? Is Bok Nam super mad? So Brother-in-law needs to sell the house to pay back the motorcycle?

415
1678
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,240
Hey, take a breath when you ask questions.

416
1682
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,890
Did you resolve it well?

417
1686
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,060
He doesn't have to go as far as selling the home.

418
1690
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,770
Thankfully, he talked to him well and it settled well.

419
1694
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,260
But an expensive motorcycle is truly different after all.

420
1698
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,460
But since other places are fine, we agreed for him to just pay for the side mirror.

421
1702
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,540
In installments.

422
1706
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,030
And I have to work harder now, too, since it's Bok Nam's shop.

423
1710
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,520
I mean, that's what I'm saying. Who would've thought he was the store owner's son?

424
1714
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,560
But we got to see your husband in a new light through this.

425
1718
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,990
I mean, he's someone who did a triple somersault to avoid breaking the side mirror but he went and kicked that off.

426
1722
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,070
We were totally shocked.

427
1726
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,960
Well, I was kind of shocked too.

428
1730
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,660
You don't tell us but I guess he really loves his wife a lot?

429
1734
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,600
That's what's called the power of love. Though someone cold-blooded, like you, wouldn't know about it.

430
1738
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,480
Don't be a brat.

431
1742
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,770
Unni's condition isn't too great since we're heading to the persimmon and pear gathering.

432
1746
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,600
- Persimmon and pear gathering? 
- I know, right?

433
1751
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,070
I was curious about that too, earlier. Why do you call it persimmon and pear gathering?

434
1755
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,840
You'll know when you go there.

435
1759
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,130
You cut her hair.

436
1763
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,730
Looks so different.

437
1767
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,990
Hey, you know the makeup I am using now.

438
1771
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,100
Ji Ho, tell us about your married life.

439
1775
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,660
Actually, we are quite hurt that you didn't tell us about it at all, no matter how much you're trying to do a small wedding.

440
1779
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,230
I'm sorry. I didn't have the time.

441
1783
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,530
So? Where's your newlywed home? Apartment? Full lease? Can't be an owned?

442
1787
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,140
Yes, owned.

443
1791
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,740
Wow, he's so capable.

444
1795
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,540
Though, it's got a mortgage on it.

445
1799
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,100
Hey, who can start without a loan these days. That's a given.

446
1803
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,200
That's a great time. It was great for us during the newlywed time too.

447
1807
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,980
So then? Do you like being married?

448
1811
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,920
Yeah. Well.

449
1815
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,170
It seems I do like it.

450
1819
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,400
Ooh, what is it that you like so much?

451
1823
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,660
When we were newlyweds, my husband would run to me as soon as he got off work.

452
1827
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,510
He looks for you as soon as he gets home from work, right?

453
1831
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,450
Well, yeah. He looks for me a lot.

454
1835
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,450
<i>Kitty…</i>

455
1839
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:55,560
At the front door, he starts calling my name.

456
1843
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,750
When I go to him,

457
1847
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,330
<i>You're home.</i>

458
1851
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,900
he'll abruptly lift me up.

459
1855
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,440
<i>Then.</i>

460
1859
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,430
- We go to the bedroom right away. 
- Right away?

461
1864
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,480
- Oh, I'm hot, it's hot. 
- Hey, isn't that a little too hot?

462
1869
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,770
Hey, even so, don't have a baby too quickly. The moment you have a baby your newlywed life is over.

463
1873
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,570
Hey, that's advice for twenty-somethings! She has to consider her age now.

464
1877
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,790
To be honest, it's easier to have a baby sooner, even if by one day.

465
1881
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,560
But even when you think that, as soon as you visit your in-laws, such thoughts completely disappear.

466
1885
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,250
But in-laws are probably better than company bosses who are sons of bitches, right?

467
1889
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,290
Let's drink this and shake it all off.

468
1893
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,760
Cheers!

469
1897
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,250
Soo Ji, you still drink like a fish? You are pretty amazing.

470
1901
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,740
When I was pregnant, I craved beer so much I would watch beer commercials every night.

471
1905
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,800
Wasn't it to see Song Joong Ki in those beer commercials?

472
1909
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,650
- Hey, these days instead of Song Joong Ki, it's Park Bo Gum—
- Hey…

473
1914
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,030
Come on, how could you young ladies who haven't had kids relate to that feeling?

474
1918
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,010
That's right, you wouldn't know.

475
1922
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,460
You don't have a separate smoking room, do you?

476
1926
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,530
You can smoke out in the parking lot.

477
1930
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,630
Alright.

478
1934
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,870
Why do you need a smoking room?

479
1938
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,990
These days, you can't just smoke anywhere, or you will get fined.

480
1942
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,680
Yeah, that's right. I think it costs about ₩100,000? ($100)

481
1946
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,640
Soo Ji. Do you have no plans to get married?

482
1950
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,110
Yeah. I am not interested in that.

483
1954
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,250
But, um, later, if you change your mind, you could get married.

484
1958
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,490
I guess, yeah. If I changed my mind, I could.

485
1962
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,750
But shouldn't you quit smoking, then?

486
1966
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,990
What?

487
1970
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:50,600
You know, if you're going to have kids, I guess drinking now is alright,

488
1974
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,110
but nicotine is not fully expelled from your body, and that is really bad for the baby. Isn't that right?

489
1978
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,460
<i>That is true.</i>

490
1982
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,490
Did you see that?

491
1986
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:03,550
- Nag... (persimmons)
 - Yes, your body is important if you plan to have babies.

492
1991
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:09,050
... Nag (pears)... persimmons and pears gathering.
 <i>(A busybody is said to nag others about putting pears or persimmons on someone else's death memorial table.)</i>

493
1996
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,120
Hey, why does everyone become 'fruit peddlers' when they get married?

494
2000
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,050
Nagging others to put persimmons or pears on the table?

495
2004
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,110
That's why everyone gets married.

496
2008
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:24,860
One of the fun parts of life is getting to nag people about persimmons and pears.

497
2012
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,710
But, Ho Rang. Were you not able to eat much before? Are you hungry?

498
2016
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,130
Yep, I'm hungry.

499
2020
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,270
I couldn't really eat anything earlier. I had an upset stomach.

500
2024
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,670
Hey, I'm the one who picked a fight. Why is your stomach upset?

501
2028
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,150
I was jealous.

502
2032
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:48,710
I was jealous of the married girls, and upset. I couldn't eat anything.

503
2036
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:58,320
I have to admit since I turned 30 things are different for sure.

504
2040
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,230
That's true. When I'm standing, even for a little bit, while serving, I get tired. My skin isn't the same as before, either.

505
2044
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,560
The other day—

506
2048
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,940
After I gave birth, my body changed. Was it like that for you, too?

507
2052
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,560
You sent your kids to kindergarten already. You're pretty much done raising them.

508
2056
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,130
What's the use of being done with the kids? There's the husband I have to raise for the rest of my life.

509
2060
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:20,260
You know, hubby gained weight again...

510
2064
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,260
These days, he requires so much more looking after.

511
2068
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,470
I'm off.

512
2072
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,210
Byeeee!

513
2076
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:50,620
Ah, my belly is about to burst. I relaxed and ate like I was shooting a food porn video today.

514
2080
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,600
Then should we walk a bit?

515
2084
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,590
Should we?

516
2088
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,840
Hee Joo and Yeong Ok became best friends after they got married, huh?

517
2092
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,280
That's true. They used to be like water and oil in the past.

518
2096
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,130
You too, Ji Ho.

519
2100
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,240
What? Me?

520
2104
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,510
The girls always found you difficult before.

521
2108
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,210
But look how they are now that you're married, they've gotten so comfortable with you.

522
2112
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,300
Now you all have something in common.

523
2116
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,750
Ah, what of it? They were like that because we haven't seen each other in a while.

524
2120
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,180
And after thinking about it, they haven't said anything that was wrong.

525
2124
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,040
About what?

526
2128
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,690
After all, it's the woman who has to have the baby.

527
2132
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,060
It's better to have a kid while you're even just a year younger, when you're healthier.

528
2136
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:39,290
If you want to do that, it makes sense to get married when you're a year younger.

529
2140
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,710
Ho Rang…

530
2144
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:47,140
Why do you want to get married?

531
2148
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,980
You know, right? That ever since I was little, I had no interest in black clothes.

532
2152
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,420
Of course.

533
2156
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,250
Red, pink, yellow.

534
2160
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:10,490
Whenever we would get together, I would make bets with Soo Ji about what bright color you would show up wearing.

535
2164
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:16,930
But you know, these days, I open my closet and find myself drawn to clothes that don't stand out.

536
2168
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,670
Whatever clothes you wear it with, it'll look good.

537
2172
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,410
Wherever you go, you won't stick out.

538
2176
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,520
That's why I like it.

539
2180
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:32,520
You know, one of the ahjummas who was in the friend group with my mom

540
2184
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,950
was a manager of some insurance company.

541
2188
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:40,630
She took great care of herself, so she was slim, had no wrinkles,

542
2192
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,040
and she earned well.

543
2196
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,740
After they all went to the bathhouse together, she would always treat everyone to a meal afterward.

544
2200
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,750
All the other ahjummas were envious of her, that she had a fabulous lifestyle.

545
2204
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,660
I see.

546
2208
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:59,190
But you know, when they all took a group trip, they would leave that ahjumma out.

547
2212
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,890
Really?

548
2216
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,930
Why?

549
2220
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:07,600
That ahjumma was a red coat.

550
2224
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:13,610
She was too busy working to get married.

551
2228
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:22,140
Ji Ho, I just want to live an average life, like other people.

552
2232
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,530
With a husband, with kids—that kind of ahjumma.

553
2236
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:35,000
When I see the other friends, I want to talk about our in-laws together, and about raising our kids.

554
2240
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,530
Now I just want to wear that kind of black coat.

555
2244
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:46,200
So I don't stand out from other people, the same as other people.

556
2248
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,200
Doing the same thing as other people,

557
2252
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,320
talking together, laughing together,

558
2256
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,110
that's my dream.

559
2260
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,560
To me, marriage means that I am as good as everyone else,

560
2264
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,590
that I have worth as a woman.

561
2268
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,510
That's what a black coat says to me now.

562
2272
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,260
<i>Ho Rang was a kid for whom the color red was very well suited.</i>

563
2276
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:24,310
<i> Gosh, why isn't she coming?</i>

564
2280
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,330
<i> She'll probably come soon.</i>

565
2284
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,720
<i>Ji Ho! Soo Ji!</i>

566
2288
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,170
<i>Oh, I'm going home.</i>

567
2292
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:35,920
<i>- No, wait! 
- I'm leaving!</i>

568
2297
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,580
<i> Hey, are you a stoplight?</i>

569
2301
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,590
<i>What? It's pretty!</i>

570
2305
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,770
<i>It's tacky, totally tacky.</i>

571
2309
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,580
<i> - Let's go! 
 - Let's go!</i>

572
2314
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:48,650
<i>A girl who was always confident even when she wore different colors than other people.</i>

573
2318
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,900
<i>That's who Ho Rang was.</i>

574
2322
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,740
<i>Kyung Hae Unni</i>

575
2326
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:26,720
<i>When did we start being embarrassed to wear different colors than other people?</i>

576
2330
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,890
<i>But what's even more upsetting…</i>

577
2334
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,650
<i>One, two three!</i>

578
2338
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,910
<i>is that for me, the feeling of wearing that black coat called marriage</i>

579
2342
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,470
<i>was not bad after all</i>.

580
2346
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,180
<i>No, if I were to be more honest...</i>

581
2350
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,420
<i>Ji Ho, congratulations again on your marriage. Now that we're ahjummas together, let's see each other more often.</i>

582
2354
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,720
<i>Yes, let's have a couples' gathering next time?</i>

583
2358
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,100
<i>Welcome to married couple life!</i>

584
2362
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,170
<i>I liked it,</i>

585
2366
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:11,080
<i>that I somehow belonged now.</i>

586
2370
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:28,270
♫ <i>Among so many hours</i> ♫

587
2374
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:31,620
♫ <i>Those days that breezed us by</i> ♫

588
2378
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,270
What brings you here?

589
2382
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:38,140
You said you were coming home on the bus in your text earlier.

590
2386
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,610
It's really late,

591
2390
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:47,660
and there was the situation with Bok Nam yesterday.

592
2394
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:53,860
So, to be honest, I was a little worried—as a person who lives with you.

593
2398
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,400
Ah, as a person who lives with me?

594
2402
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,510
Yes.

595
2406
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:10,060
A landlord's consideration? Something like that? Feeling protective of your tenant?

596
2410
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:17,150
Well, more like a leader of a club taking care of its member, perhaps?

597
2414
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,780
Ah.

598
2418
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,610
Shall we go?

599
2422
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,110
So you had a gathering with your former classmates?

600
2426
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,150
Yes.

601
2430
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,920
Honestly, it was a little strange, today.

602
2434
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,140
They're not close friends,

603
2438
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,090
but now that I'm married,

604
2442
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,840
it feels like I've gotten closer to them,

605
2446
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,110
the feeling of belonging to a group.

606
2450
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:55,120
It's been a long time since I've felt that.

607
2454
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,320
It feels…

608
2458
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:04,520
It was nice, actually.

609
2462
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,700
Now you're at the stage where you experience the sense of belonging.

610
2466
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,200
- Huh? 
 - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, a psychological theory.

611
2471
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,140
When a human reaches one level of need, he naturally wants the next level.

612
2475
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,250
Why suddenly?

613
2479
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:21,470
Why would Maslow come up now?

614
2483
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,820
It's not out of nowhere.

615
2487
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:28,430
Ji Ho, your current state is when you're feeling your animalistic need most, as a human.

616
2491
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:33,690
Ji Ho, through marriage, you have achieved the basic hierarchy of physiological needs.

617
2495
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,680
Then through me, as your landlord, you've achieved the next hierarchy, safety needs.

618
2499
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,730
Now the third hierarchy, social belonging.

619
2503
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:44,760
You've naturally developed the need to belong somewhere.

620
2507
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,050
So these feelings you are having,

621
2511
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,510
they are nothing more than animalistic desires.

622
2515
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:52,840
<i>I only feel this every once in a while…</i>

623
2519
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,830
These are all instinctive, but ultimately futile desires of humans, of course.

624
2523
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:01,480
<i>He can be really obnoxious sometimes.</i>

625
2527
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,230
Why are you looking at me like that?

626
2531
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,690
Stars in the sky tonight... There really aren't any.

627
2535
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:22,530
Ah, I deposited my monthly rent today.

628
2539
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:25,200
Yes, I've checked it.

629
2543
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,380
Ho Rang, are you still sleeping?

630
2547
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,060
Yeah.

631
2551
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:15,810
Get up. It's already noon.

632
2555
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,190
Just a little longer. I want to sleep in since today's my day off.

633
2559
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,040
Hurry. It's sunny, so I want to hang up the blankets.

634
2563
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,650
Why are you acting so busy since early this morning?

635
2567
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:32,340
Stop scratching your head.

636
2571
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,940
Rang, if you do that you'll get dandruff!

637
2575
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,650
- What? 
 - Wow, these days

638
2580
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,340
I guess since we've been together seven years now, you're really letting yourself go, huh?

639
2584
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:46,300
You used to wash your hair as soon as you woke up, put on eyeliner, do it all. That's all gone now.

640
2588
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,650
So now that it's been seven years, you're pretty full of yourself, huh?

641
2592
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:55,220
Don't mess with me today! I'm not doing anything today, not even going to shower.

642
2596
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:00,620
Wake up already.

643
2600
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,350
Isn't that dirt under your nails? Oh, gross…

644
2604
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:09,140
Rang! There's dirt under your fingernails, dirt!

645
2608
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:14,320
Hey? I do not! How could I have dirt under my fingernails—

646
2612
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,170
Where?

647
2616
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,100
Just look at that.

648
2620
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,460
What is this?

649
2624
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,340
Ho Rang.

650
2628
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,620
You know my favorite mathematician, Gödel?

651
2632
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:37,170
His "incompleteness theorems" became the foundation for the development of today's computers.

652
2636
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:45,000
What it says, among other things, is that there is truth that cannot be proven by mathematics.

653
2640
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:52,860
I think that all this time, I wanted some sort of proof regarding you.

654
2644
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,660
So what I realized is that

655
2648
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,340
complete proof of our love is not possible.

656
2652
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,860
Because it is such a perfect truth.

657
2656
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,560
Do you know what I'm trying to say?

658
2660
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:16,700
Do you think…

659
2664
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,030
I would know?

660
2668
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:24,540
Stop babbling crap and say it already.

661
2672
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:32,520
From now on, I won't make you feel insecure and lonely anymore.

662
2676
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:38,400
So, Ho Rang.

663
2680
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,260
Will you please marry me?

2684

♫ <i>Though I endure a day like today</i> ♫

668
2700

 - Yes.

669
2705
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,610
You really are.

670
2709
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,600
How can this happen now? I have bedhead.

671
2713
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,770
That's why I told you to shower, dummy.

Where is this water coming from?

675
2729
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,320
What is this?

676
2733
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,370
Alright, let's stop the meeting here.

677
2737
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:28,620
Excuse me, Ms. Yoon Bo Mi! The CEO isn't finished talking. Please take a seat.

678
2741
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:37,130
Everyone, I want to give you some great news.

679
2745
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:40,860
I scouted a very talented developer.

680
2749
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,550
- Daebak. 
 - Who is it?

681
2754
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:47,810
Some of you may know him already. Who could it be?

682
2758
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:50,890
Wake Alarm's CEO Sim Won Seok!

683
2762
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,680
Applause!

684
2766
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,400
What's with this atmosphere?

685
2770
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:59,810
<i>Follow me.</i>

686
2774
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,860
Alright, you all wrap up here.

687
2778
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,860
Why on earth would they be against this?

688
2782
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,460
Why would they?

689
2786
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,160
Because Wake Alarm was a total failure.

690
2790
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,080
If you're scouting him just because he is your friend,

691
2794
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,160
then I concluded I should step up to represent all the employees.

692
2798
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,190
Wow, Director Nam, do you think the CEO of your company is such a loser?

693
2802
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:32,860
Won Seok may look plain on the outside, but he is a genius. Do you know about the incident of the '07 class?

694
2806
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,500
You know, among the '07 freshman class,

695
2810
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:43,140
someone made that site, "Find the Second Kim Tae Hee," and all the servers were overloaded and shut down?

696
2814
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,270
- Ah. 
 - Right! That was none other than Won Seok.

697
2819
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:48,930
Do you know how old he was that time? Eighteen.

698
2823
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:54,000
Even though he started school early and was two years younger than the rest of his year,

699
2827
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,970
he was the best of the best.

700
2831
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:03,140
Alright, Director Nam, I'll be honest. He's a bit weak when it comes to business sense.

701
2835
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,240
But as a developer, he's really the best.

702
2839
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,480
Director Nam. You believe me, right?

703
2843
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:17,350
What is that expression? Like you're looking at a stray cat soaked by the rain?

704
2847
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:19,080
It's not.

705
2851
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,280
What's not?

706
2855
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,450
I said it's not.

707
2859
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:26,780
Do you know what the most annoying things in the world are?

708
2863
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:31,220
Stopping shitting mid-shit. Or not wiping your shit completely. Or... someone who starts to say something, then stops.

709
2867
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,980
Okay. Let's talk outside.

710
2871
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,500
What do you mean, outside? It's cold outside.

711
2875
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,720
Okay, then.

712
2879
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:46,070
CEO Ma, you. Did you, by any chance,

713
2883
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,820
cry?

714
2887
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,090
Why would I cry?

715
2891
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,740
What— Why would I cry?

716
2895
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,340
After you cry, the rims of your eyes turn red.

717
2899
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,360
The skin under your eyes is more sensitive than most people's.

718
2903
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,870
What are you saying? It isn't red.

719
2907
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:13,130
What do you know about my skin?

720
2911
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,070
What do you know about me?

721
2915
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:16,440
Sure.

722
2919
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,610
Even if I've known you for 18 years,

723
2923
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:22,300
I can't possibly say I know everything about you.

724
2927
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,880
That's right. No matter how close we are, there's no way you could know everything about me.

725
2931
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,120
Look. Because I have an allergy, it's always red here.

726
2935
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,920
Why would I cry? It's just red.

727
2939
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,350
You're right. No one completely knows even their own self.

728
2943
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,250
Of course, we can't know everything about another person.

729
2947
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,750
That's it.

730
2951
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,840
But anyway.

731
2955
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,900
What?

732
2959
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,410
Why did you cry?

733
2963
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,420
Wow, it looks like new.

734
2967
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,630
Right?

735
2971
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:05,180
But I still wanted to make sure it never got scratched until the day I parted with it.

736
2975
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,450
Until the day you part with it?

737
2979
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,490
What's this? Are you thinking of passing your bike on to someone else?

738
2983
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,610
How much are you thinking of selling it for?

739
2987
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,310
<i> It's a secret.</i>

740
2991
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,870
<i>He's ridiculously cute.</i>

741
2995
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:34,370
<i>If we stay together, I might jump you.</i>

742
2999
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:38,790
<i> It was Room 304, not Room 303. Our room.</i>

743
3003
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:42,110
<i> I said I wanted to sleep with you. I never said I wanted to date you.</i>

744
3007
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,900
<i>That's right.</i>

745
3011
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:49,070
<i>I am very mean and bad. That is how I've made it this far.</i>

746
3015
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,530
CEO Ma.

747
3019
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,330
Excuse me…

748
3023
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,260
Are you crying?

749
3027
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,570
Why...

750
3031
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,190
Are you hurt somewhere?

751
3035
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,630
Why...

752
3039
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,540
Are you hurt somewhere?

753
3043
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,190
<i> CEO Ma!</i>

754
3047
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,960
Come here.

755
3051
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,590
CEO! CEO!

756
3055
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,200
He isn't here, either.

757
3059
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,340
Then where did he go?

758
3063
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,710
CEO?

759
3067
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,840
If your employees find out that their CEO was crying,

760
3071
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,620
that would be humiliating.

761
3075
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,760
What's wrong? Are you really hurt somewhere?

762
3079
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,880
Do you want me to take you to a hospital?

763
3083
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,210
I thought about it.

764
3087
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,670
My company, I can't do it.

765
3091
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,990
What?

766
3095
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,330
I really thought about it a lot.

767
3099
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,110
I don't think I'll be able to sell my company.

768
3103
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,850
But, if I don't sell my company,

769
3107
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:13,290
that means I can't see you anymore.

770
3111
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:19,250
My heart hurts so much.

771
3115
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:26,090
<i> If you really want to sleep with me, sell your company first.</i>

772
3119
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:28,830
<i> Then I'll date you.</i>

773
3123
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:34,820
Then, because I said you should sell your company…

774
3127
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,780
Really?

775
3131
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:41,660
Love is important to me, but

776
3135
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,980
my company is just as important to me as love is.

777
3139
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:50,890
This is really embarrassing, but

778
3143
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,750
when I think about not being able to see you...

779
3147
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:09,630
You know what? Can I kiss you?

780
3151
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,000
What?

781
3155
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,230
Do what?

782
3159
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:18,130
Can I kiss you?

783
3163
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,400
Don't do it. I'm telling you I can't give my company up.

784
3167
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,460
So, you don't want me to kiss you?

785
3171
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,760
That's not what I mean, either.

786
3175
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,060
Should I kiss you then?

787
3179
