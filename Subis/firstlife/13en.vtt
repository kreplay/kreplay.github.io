23

I don't have the confidence.

35
141
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,390
What? You don't have the confidence?

36
145
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,060
As if dating for seven years isn't enough, you said to wait another five years!

37

But  . . .

38

Come now and you say you don't have the confidence?

39
157
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,600
That's why you shouldn't wait!

40
161
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,340
Was it seven years of dating for you only?

41
165
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,880
I did too! I dated for seven years too, just the same as you did!

42

But why do you always talk like you're the only one who's suffered some loss?

43
173

Why do you always talk like you're the only one who has waited? Why?

44
177
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,400
Hey! For the likes of getting married, I quit all the things I wanted to do.

<i>To Room Nineteen?</i>

Oh, that's

76
305
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,150
a book I liked when I was in college.

77
309
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,970
Lately, I thought of it again so I'm reading it.

78
313
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,680
May I ask what the story is about?

79
317
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,480
There's a husband and wife.

80
321
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,020
They are a perfect couple.

81
325
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,550
Even when others see them, they lack nothing.

82
329
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,820
They, themselves, are also happy in their life.

83
333
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,190
A family that's full and happy.

84
337
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:10,010
But then one day, the wife suddenly wanted to have her own space.

85
341
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,290
So the husband made a room for the wife upstairs.

86
345
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,880
"Mother's Room."

87
349
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,190
He named it.

88
353
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,040
But then somehow

89
357
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,920
the kids start to frequent the room and with the family members going in and out,

90
361
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,760
that room also becomes yet another living room.

91
365
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,450
So what happens to the wife?

92
369
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:52,220
So that wife, at a cheap hotel far away from home,

93
373
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,770
she gets a room without the family knowing.

94
377
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:03,000
And every now and then, for a few hours at a time, she stays in that room alone.

95
381
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,810
Doing nothing.

96
385
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,360
Just being inside the room gave her happiness.

97
389
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:22,970
Since that room is a perfect space that's all hers alone.

98
393
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:31,800
Since being married means your time and space alone disappear.

99
397
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,310
Just the fact that another person isn't there could bring her happiness.

100
401
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,130
Plenty.

101
405
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
It's a good story.

102
409
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,150
It's also a sad story.

103
413
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,930
Actually, while reading that book, I thought of you.

104
417
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,130
You said that.

105
421
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:08,370
That the only things you can be responsible for are this house and Kitty

106
425
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,780
and yourself only.

107
429
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,560
So that's why you weren't getting married.

108
433
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,400
At the time, those words were very relatable to me

109
437
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,690
since I was also in a situation where I could only be responsible for this one room alone.

110
441
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:32,280
But you know . . . if you live like that,

111
445
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,580
won't you be lonely?

112
449
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,900
Have you never thought you were lonely?

113
453
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm not sure.

114
457
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,150
I think I've been living life without thinking of loneliness altogether.

115
461
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:05,060
Being alone is better than enduring and knocking into people.

116
465
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,780
I had lived life with that thought.

117

122
489

You should stay a few more days.

176

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,590
It's alright. Are you the only one who works?

177
710
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,830
I work too, you know!

178
714
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,790

180

You know the place I've been paying installments for in Munraedong? They said I can move in next year.

181
726
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,180
So next year, come to Seoul and let's live together. Okay?

182
730
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,560
If you want to live with me so bad, you come to Namhae then.

183
734
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,030
Don't keep on only joking around.

How long are you going to be going back and forth from Seoul to Namhae like this?

185
742
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,440
Do I walk around? The bus picks me up right in front and back. What?

186
746
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,810
Go now.

187
750
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,000
What are you talking about? Hurry and get in.

188
754
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,210
It's alright. I can just take the subway. It goes all the way to the terminal without needing to transfer.

189
758
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,520
What subway? Hurry and get in, and stop being so stubborn.

190
762
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,750
I heard all about you getting cursed at by your manager earlier.

191
766
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,330
Hurry and go to work now.

192
770

Mom!

193
774
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,200
I'll escort you.

194
778
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,090
Hello, Mother. I am Woo Soo Ji's boyfriend, Ma Sang Goo.

195
782
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,540
Boyfriend?

196
786
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,830
I didn't know she had a boyfriend though.

197
790
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,370
Well, she tends to be reserved

198
794
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,490
so I thought I should say hi to you first, and I came like this.

199
798
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,200
Great big height too.

200
802
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,350
Our Soo Ji holds her own in height too.

201
806
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,080
How is it that you're just so compatible?

202
810
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,010
Since I was little, I was not picky about food and I loved spinach.

203
814
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,400
So, not funny.

204
818
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,460
It looks like Soo Ji is late for work today. Mother, I'll take you.

205
822
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,550
Come, get in, please.

206
826
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,900
Never mind.

207
830
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,100
I will take her.

208
834
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,160
Where? That car?

209
838
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,000
Yes.

210
842
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,330
Mother, give that to me. I will.

211
846
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,250
Mom!

212
850
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,990
You hurry and go to work now.

213
854
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,660
Soo Ji takes after you so much.

214
858
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,930
How? She doesn't look like me one bit.

215
862
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:25,410
She looks like a fruit bowl. And me, just the look of a beauty.

216
866
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,800
Soo Ji doesn't compare to me when I was young.

217
870
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,710
No, even now, it seems like you're the one who's more beautiful.

218
874
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,110
But what do you do?

219
878
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,250
Oh, I represent a company that's in developing social networking app.

220
882
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,320
Our main service is called Gyeolmalrae, an app for making matches.

221
886
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,420
So how should I explain this. Um . . .

222
890
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,410
Oh, Ji Ho's husband. You know him, right? I'm the CEO of that company.

223
894
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,610
- Oh, Ji Ho's husband? 
- Yes.

224
899
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,180
You're the president of that company, you said?

225
903
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,290
Yes. He's my closest friend and I'm the CEO of that company.

226
907
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,750
Then you're also a '80 birther?

227
911
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,420
Yes, I'm 38 this year. Yes.

228
915
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,350
That's more than I thought.

229
919
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,550
Well, as long as you're younger than me!

230
923
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,590
But you're not younger than me, right, Mother?

231
927
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,020
Just a moment.

232
931
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,490
Yes.

233
935
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,850
Very . . .

234
939
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,610
beautiful night, it is.

235
943
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,630
I'm all slept out for the night.

236
947
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,880
I just slept like that?

237
951
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,830
Is this for real right now?

238
955
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,960
That golden opportunity.

239
959
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,360
How did I shoot a suicide goal (own goal)?

242
971

Breakfast?

310
1248
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,980
<i>That's why, I'm</i>

311
1252
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,410
<i>not going to make dramas anymore.</i>

312
1256
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,100
<i>I'm never doing it again.</i>

313
1260
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,430
Thank you.

314
1264
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,370
Aricha is one of my favorites.

315
1268
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,610
I thought the CEO was a man.

316
1272
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,270
Are you disappointed because it's me?

317
1276
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,900
No. That's not what I mean.

318
1280
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,230
Honestly, I was a bit surprised.

319
1284
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,770
I understand.

320
1288
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,540
I didn't know it would've been you, the one with pretty earrings.

321
1292
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,280
Is this destiny?

322
1296
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,850
Anyway, it was our director that stopped by here.

323
1300
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:53,870
He said that he sent many texts but there was no response to any of them.

324
1304
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,130
Oh, yes.

325
1308
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,320
The cafe has been busy lately.

326
1312
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,160
But how did you know...

327
1316
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,430
Oh, the director called you

328
1320
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,790
and the other employee picked it up.

329
1324
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,830
He told us that you were working here.

330
1328
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,860
Oh.

331
1332
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,230
Officially, I would like to introduce myself.

332
1336
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,840
After reading your script, I came here.

333
1340
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,960
I'm production company CEO Go Jung Min.

334
1344
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,860
I happened to see the script you were working on with Director Park

335
1348
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,760
about the student hostel.

336
1352
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,880
I wondered what kind of person you were and I wanted to see you.

337
1356
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,520
I mean to be specific.

338
1360
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,550
I wanted to work with you, Writer.

339
1364
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,580
I... I'm not doing any more drama.

340
1368
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,780
It's been a while since I quit my job as an assistant writer.

341
1372
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,840
I'm sorry.

342
1376
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:19,420
Did you only quit being an assistant writer, or did you quit writing completely?

343
1380
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,610
I came here because I wanted to work with you.

344
1384
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,390
Hello Soo Ji.

345
1388
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,010
Seatbelt.

346
1392
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,660
Yes.

347
1396
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,750
Are you not writing anymore?

348
1400
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,840
I'm sorry.

349
1404
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,770
Writing too… I don't do it anymore.

350
1408
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,680
Can I ask for a reason why?

351
1412
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,850
I'm married.

352
1416
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,660
Since I'm married, I decided to quit.

353
1420
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:34,490
I'm just working here part time because staying at home was too boring.

354
1424
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,080
I see. You're married.

355
1428
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,660
Yes.

356
1432
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,280
I'm sorry since you came all the way here.

357
1436
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,700
Then...

358
1440
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,790
Enjoy your drink and have a nice day.

359
1444
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,050
However, Writer.

360
1448
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:11,550
Why does that reason sound like a sad one to me?

361
1452
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,290
I enjoyed the coffee.

362
1456
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:31,960
If you want don't want to give me that excuse and give me the truth,

363
1460
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,360
contact me whenever.

364
1464
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,940
Even if we don't work together, we can always have a drink.

365
1468
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,510
Why are you so mad?

366
1472
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,270
What are you doing?

367
1476
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:42,740
What do you mean?  In place of my busy girlfriend,

368
1480
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,560
I sent my girlfriend's mother home.

369
1484
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,660
So what?

370
1488
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,730
Is this CEO Ma's type of dating?

371
1492
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,660
Barging into the parts of someone's personal life that they don't want to show you?

372
1496
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,810
Making someone miserable by doing that?

373
1500
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,590
Miserable?

374
1504
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:09,860
People who love each other meeting each other's family,

375
1508
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,920
knowing each other's situation.

376
1512
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,440
How can you call such a normal thing miserable?

377
1516
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,930
It makes me miserable!

378
1520
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,640
Normal?

379
1524
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,810
Do you know what a repulsive word that is to me?

380
1528
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,280
"What do your parents do? Are you parents doing well?"

381
1532
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,850
In this world, those types of "normal" questions are what I hate the most.

382
1536
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,730
And then you would be like this.

383
1540
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,810
"Why are you taking it so twisted? They could do that if they didn't know."

384
1544
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,800
But there are hundreds, thousands of people who say those kinds of things to me.

385
1548
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,700
Do you know how it feels to live in this world?

386
1552
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,250
That's why I want to live together.

387
1556
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,810
In this world,

388
1560
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,570
I said that I'll be by your side!

389
1564
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,710
By my side?

390
1568
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,030
How?

391
1572
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:02,440
If we do get married, will you be able to live with my mother?

392
1576
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,450
Answer me!

393
1580
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,950
I'm asking if you can live like that!

394
1584
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,350
I can just do it, why can't I?

395
1588
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,990
Fine.

396
1592
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,660
What are you going to say to your parents?

397
1596
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,850
"A woman doesn't know who her father is

398
1600
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:26,280
and who lives to take care of her disabled mother, that's the kind of woman I'm marrying."

399
1604
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,690
Is that how you are going to introduce me?

400
1608
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:45,110
My mom, with her disability, worked in a restaurant to raise me by herself.

401
1612
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,950
Since I was lucky and was able to study well,

402
1616
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,130
I got into a large corporation that gives good pay.

403
1620
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,450
Finally, I am able to ask her to move in with me.

404
1624
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,630
Unlike your kind where three generations are gathered and living together.

405
1628
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,520
I don't know that kind of "normal" world.

406
1632
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,500
My mom...

407
1636
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,780
Someone to lean on when she's sick…

408
1640
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,340
She has no one in this world but me.

409
1644
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:27,010
Even when she dies she'll have no one but me to bury her.

410
1648
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,210
That's the world I live in, CEO Ma.

411
1652
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,870
So, don't give me any false hope.

412
1656
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,980
If you are this warm to me,

413
1660
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,240
I'll start to become greedy for a different world.

414
1664
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:29,870
In "To Room 19," the main character eventually

415
1668
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:36,620
has her secret room discovered by her husband.

416
1672
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:42,930
And she lies to her husband

417
1676
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,870
that she'd been having an affair.

418
1680
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:53,820
At the time, my 20-year-old self couldn't understand the main character.

419
1684
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,410
To tell such a big lie of having an affair.

420
1688
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:03,060
Was keeping the room secret really that important?

421
1692
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,210
<i>I can understand that.</i>

422
1696
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:12,260
<i>Because that room, the moment other people know about it, it no longer has meaning.</i>

423
1700
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:16,460
<i>Still, how could she lie that she was having an affair?</i>

424
1704
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:24,530
<i>"For a year now I've been spending all my days in a very sordid hotel room."</i>

425
1708
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,800
<i>"It's the place where I'm happy. In fact, without it, I don't exist."</i>

426
1712
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,560
<i>"She heard herself saying this, and understood how terrified he was that she might."</i>

427
1716
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,090
<i>- You don't get it? 
- No.</i>

428
1721
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,580
<i>What it means is, rather than trying to explain something that her husband could never understand,<i></i></i>

429
1725
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,170
<i>being mistaken for a crazy bitch was easier.</i>

430
1729
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:49,150
<i>Actually, there are a lot of things in the world that are easier that way.</i>

431
1733
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,350
<i>It's better to be a crazy wench than a pathetic wench.</i>

432
1737
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:59,770
<i>Earlier, to that CEO . . .</i>

433
1741
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:04,780
<i>Why did I reply like that?</i>,

434
1745
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,140
<i>When she asked me if I wouldn't be writing anymore…</i>

435
1749
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,320
<i>Why did I reply that I got married?</i>

436
1753
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,150
<i>The bus will arrive shortly. </i>

437
1757
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,310
If you're going to keep crying like that, let's just talk later.

438
1761
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,610
I'm not crying. I won't cry anymore.

439
1765
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,400
Have you given yourself time to think about it?

440
1769
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,520
Yeah.

441
1773
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,050
I was wrong.

442
1777
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,910
What did you do wrong?

443
1781
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,370
For yelling and screaming at you.

444
1785
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:28,740
You worked so hard to move that couch in, but I was only annoyed.

445
1789
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,020
Also, for giving you pressure for asking you to marry me Also, for—

446
1793
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,870
So if we date again, what changes?

447
1797
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,900
What?

448
1801
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:46,050
If we date again, are you not going to ask to get married anymore?

449
1805
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,180
If you don't like it,

450
1809
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:56,900
- I won't ask anymore.
 - That's not the problem right now!

451
1814
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,580
You just want to get married, so why are you hiding that fact for me?!

452
1818
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,710
I'm not hiding it.

453
1822
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:07,130
- I just want to marry you because it's with you—
- Are you sure you want to do it with me?

454
1827
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,740
Are you confident? Are you that confident about your heart?

455
1831
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,010
What are you saying? What's wrong with you?

456
1835
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,730
You contacted another guy.

457
1839
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,950
I saw it.

458
1843
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,100
How you were chatting with another guy on my company's dating app.

459

00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,050
I... I was just trying it out.

460
1851
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,350
I just installed it because you work for that company now. However, I got a message first, so I—

461
1855
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,180
Still, you talked to someone.

462
1859
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,140
- I was just messing around. There was no meaning behind it.
 - Why is there nothing to it?

463
1864
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:44,020
You want to get married and chatted with a guy looking for a girl to marry.

464
1868
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,560
But still, you're telling me it meant nothing?

465
1872
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,020
- No. My heart wasn't being sincere.
 - Heart?

466
1877
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,050
Your heart was relating to facts, actually.

467
1881
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,690
For months, how were we like?

468
1885
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:01,760
As soon as you opened your mouth, it was marriage and as soon as I opened my eyes, I was busy running away.

469
1889
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,960
You were always pressuring me…

470
1893
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,760
and I couldn't fill you.

471
1897

That's a fact and how we feel.

472
1901
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:20,090
Plus, how you replied to that man is also what's in your heart.

473
1905
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,580
I would also like you to be honest with your heart from now on.

A production company?

502
2023

Yeah. For drama. She wanted to work with me, so she came to meet me.

Ah. Then are you going to write again?

Was the CEO a woman?

508
2048
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,170
Yes.

509
2052
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:09,870
A very strong woman.

510
2056
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,780
She's strong but how should I say it?

511
2060
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:18,280
That sturdiness isn't to break her surroundings but to embrace it.

512
2064
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,710
She wasn't someone common, that CEO.

513
2068
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:28,180
Even though she has a common name, like me.

514

Yeah. It's a common name.

Rang.

518
2088
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,650
I found her like this on some park bench and brought her home.

519
2092
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,820
She said she had no strength in her legs to walk.

520

00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,150
Rang. Ho Rang.

522
2104
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,390
Yeah, let's go inside. You'll get a cold.

523
2108
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,130
I can't bring myself to go in.

524
2112
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:21,890
I can't go into that room.

525
2116
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,660
Oh, you actually came.

526
2120
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,730
Oh? Oh! It's Se Hee Hyung!

527
2124
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:44,690
It's Nam Se Hee!

528
2128
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,900
See? See? I told you, he'd come right away if I called him, our Se Hee Hyung.

529
2132
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,870
Did he drink a lot?

530
2136
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,130
Yeah.

531
2140
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,990
Have a glass, my mentor.

532
2144
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,040
- Mentor?
 - Of course!

533
2149
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,630
It's no longer you, Hyung, but our Se Hee Hyung who's my mentor now.

534
2153
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:06,470
Hey. What did he say to you? What did you say to him?

535
2157
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:09,830
He told me to be honest.

536
2161
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:13,320
<i>The subjects of the sentences you just spoke,</i>

537
2165
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,990
<i>they're all about yourself.</i>

538
2169
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,270
<i>Your other half isn't the subject of your sentences.</i>

539
2173
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:24,490
So I tried changing the subject of my sentences.

540
2177
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:28,320
Rang smiles because of me?

541
2181
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:33,770
<i>Maybe she and I are walking on parallel lines that will never touch. </i>

542
2185
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:39,640
Because of me, Rang was happy.

543
2189
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,560
<i>Won Seok, if I have to wait 5 more years, I'll be 35.</i>

544
2193
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,630
<i>Are you saying we should date for 12 years?</i>

545
2197
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:54,030
Also, Rang can't live without me.

546
2201
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,040
When I changed the subjects like that,

547
2205
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,760
the answer was very simple.

548
2209
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,590
The formula was wrong to begin with,

549
2213
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:07,070
to get an answer.

550
2217
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:12,930
For 7 years, I've chosen only the paths

551
2221
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,270
that made me happy.

552
2225
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:42,470
Life's too long.

553
2229
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:45,430
You have to go through too many things.

554
2233
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,950
I know, right?

555
2237
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:51,790
It's only going to get worse, isn't it?

556
2241
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,810
You look disturbed today too.

557
2245
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:02,710
I... Today a production company CEO came to find me.

558
2249
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:05,160
She said she wants to work with me.

559
2253
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:12,010
But then... I...

560
2257
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,970
To the question about why I don't write anymore,

561
2261
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,830
I answered, "I got married."

562
2265
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,250
Why did I do that?

563
2269
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:31,630
You just probably find it a hassle to explain.

564
2273
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:37,670
Honestly, marriage is a good shield from society.

565
2277
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,340
A safe and sturdy shield.

566
2281
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,090
But then...

567
2285
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,960
I thought for a moment that I was being cowardly.

568
2289
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,780
Why to the extent of being cowardly?

569
2293
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,490
There are times when you just want to go with the flow.

570
2297
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:00,140
In life, there are times when you need a leg to lean on.

571
2301
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:06,690
Woo Soo, do you also have times like those?

572
2305
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,040
Where?

573
2309
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,760
CEO Ma?

574
2313
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:20,180
My legs are already 3 so there's no need for another pair.

575
2317
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,500
Huh?

576
2321
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,840
Since my mom's legs are mine.

577
2325
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,680
I better call her.

578
2329
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,320
Why did you tell this kid something so useless.

579
2333
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:45,230
Honestly, it wasn't something I said.

580
2337
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,970
You said that to me.

581
2341
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,770

593

Hey, perhaps that time,

594
2393
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,720
did something happen between you two?

595
2397

You two just suddenly requested absence from school

596
2401
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,800
Jeong Min didn't come back and just disappeared all of a sudden.

597
2405
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,260
Now that I think about it, it's a bit...

598
2409
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:22,910
Perhaps, since then, have you heard news about her?

599
2413

None, of course.

600
2417

602

Hey, you can't throw up there.

603

00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,100
I will be going in first.

611
2461
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,130
Sleep on the bed and not on the floor.

612
2465
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,620
What about Won Seok?

613
2469
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,630
I am taking care of him.

614
2473
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,040
Soo Ji.

615
2477
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:03,390
After I saw the text from your mother, I ran to your house secretly

616
2481
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:06,620
in case you would be meeting another man.

617
2485
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,710
I ran up the stairs like a lunatic.

618
2489
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,620
So pathetic, right?

619
2493
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:21,450
As you said, I must really not know your world very well.

620
2497
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,560
I just grew up ordinarily without much hardship.

621
2501
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,160
That's why, honestly, I find you difficult.

622
2505
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:36,630
Your prickliness is heavy sometimes.

623
2509
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,830
But you know,

624
2513
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,620
I must really like you a lot.

625
2517
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:51,360
Even though your prickliness is piercing me,

626
2521
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,790
even though it hurts so much.

627
2525
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,270
If only that would make it better, even if I get pricked,

628
2529
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,640
then it's such a relief.

629
2533
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:07,030
That's what I thought.

630
2537
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,300
Like today, out of nowhere all of a sudden

631
2541
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,180
I won't look into your room.

632
2545
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:19,360
And also, I won't act as if I know everything about your world.

633
2549
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,530
And you too should

634
2553
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:31,860
stand properly in front of the world.

635
2557
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:38,420
The way I see it, you have never faced the world properly.

636
2561
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:43,520
You always run away or fight.

637
2565
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:47,400
You use the company as an excuse and your mom as your shield.

638
2569
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,250
You lived only criticizing the world.

639
2573
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:55,740
For once, grab and stand in front of the world properly

640
2577
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:00,120
and face it head on. That's what I think you should do.

641
2581
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,760
And if you start,

642
2585
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,430
I will be by your side ready to hang in there for you.

643
2589
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:08,020
Okay?

644
2593
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:17,450
So charismatic, Ma Sang Goo.

645
2597
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:25,050
Aigoo. It's a bit scary to be scolded twice in a day, so

646
2601
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,890
for today, I will stop here and go back.

647
2605
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:30,230
Then see you again, Ms. Woo Soo Ji

648
2609
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:32,070
Goodbye.

649
2613
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:36,020
Aigoo. Woo Soo Ji is the scariest in the whole world.

650
2617
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,010
He's a character I can't get a grasp of.

651
2621
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:09,090
<i>To everyone, we all have our own Room #19.</i>

652
2625
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:17,980
<i>No matter how close you are, a room where you don't want to get caught.</i>

653
2629
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:33,300
But then, why do you sit on the floor since last time?

654
2633
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,820
Huh?

655
2637
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:41,400
I am used to sitting on the floor

656
2641
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,060
so this is more comfortable.

657
2645
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:46,480
But then, why did you continue to sit on the sofa?

658
2649
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,340
Back then, to do so

659
2653
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:56,170
this house was uncomfortable.

660
2657
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,400
And you too.

661
2661
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,470
You were uncomfortable.

662
2665
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:10,680
<i>No matter how comfortable you have become</i>

663
2669
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,580
<i>a room where you can't invite anyone in.</i>

664
2673
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:16,870
Sleep well.

665
2677
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:19,770
Yes. You too.

666
2681
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,870
Earlier, because it was a bit chaotic.

667
2685
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:28,310
Ah, that's right.

668
2689
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,400
That... Ji Ho.

669
2693
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,020
Yes.

670
2697
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:36,990
Dramas, though I don't know much about them.

671
2701
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:41,860
You are not hesitating to do it because of this marriage, right?

672
2705
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:46,770
- Pardon?
 - So just in case,

673
2710
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,130
if this marriage would block your future

674
2714
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:53,380
I hope that won't be the case.

675
2718
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,130
As promised,

676
2722
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:59,910
to you,

677
2726
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:02,460
I don't want to be a hindrance.

678
2730
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:08,140
Yes.

679
2734
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:13,000
I understand what you are saying.

680
2738
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:15,590
Yes.

681
2742
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:32,500
<i>Today, that person and I, for some reason...</i>

682

<i>Go Jeong Min</i>

683
2750
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:43,370
<i>I think it's a day when we need to rest in our own Room #19.</i>

684
2754
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:50,060

Ho Rang, what do you want for breakfast?

687
2766
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:41,770
You were home.

688
2770
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:45,850
I just dropped by for a while to pack my things.

689
2774
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:50,220
Why would you be the one packing? I should be the one to leave.

690
2778
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,530
I thought about it.

691
2782
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:55,440
And I think it would be better if I leave.

692
2786
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,760
You can just stay here.

693
2790
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:04,060
No... Why would you be the one leaving? You were the one who gave the deposit.

694
2794
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:06,700
Later.

695
2798
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:10,710
When the lease is over. Deposit it to my account then.

696
2802
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:26,130
Ho Rang.

697
2806
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:36,510
You're okay, right?

698
2810
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,110
Yeah.

699
2814
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:45,520
I'm much better now.

700
2818
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:50,000
Okay. That's a relief.

701
2822
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,350
I'm leaving.

702
2826
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,510
What you said was right.

703
2830
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:20,170
I'm going to be true to my heart now.

Yes?

715
2878
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:45,320
I want to write.

716
2882
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:49,640
I want to write something good.

717
2886
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:53,260
As to the what your direction is in work,

718
2890
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,970
I still don't know.

719
2894
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:02,890
I want to try to tell a good story.

720
2898
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:06,290
That is my direction.

721
2902
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:09,750
For the writer to tell the story that they want.

722
2906
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:19,250
But then, there is one thing I need to settle first.

723
2910
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,200
What is it?

724
2914
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:27,460
Did you have a contract somewhere else?

725
2918
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:33,030
No. There was something that happened that prompted me to stop writing.

726
2922
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:41,830
I was almost sexually assaulted by the assistant director I used to work with.

727
2926
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:51,340
I want to settle that first.

728
2930
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:56,680
And also, I want to write.

729
2934
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:04,530
If so... that would be good.

730
2938
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:06,960
How do you want to settle it?

731
2942
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,320
I came here to discuss how to go about that

732
2946
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,830
since I don't know the ways to settle it.

733
2950
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,950
That is, There are two ways to settle it.

734
2954
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:20,970
There's the somewhat complicated lawsuit method.

735
2958
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:25,540
If not, then there is simply making it disappear.

736
2962
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:27,980
Disappear?

737
2966
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:31,310
Yes. I normally chose the latter.

738
2970
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:33,980
My employees also do those things.

739
2974
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:37,600
Them? How?

740
2978
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:42,830
Well, all of a sudden, kill them off by surprise.

741
2982
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:45,390
If not kill them with laughter.

742
2986
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:49,640
Ahh, there is also kill by frustration.

743
2990
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:00,120
Since I already cracked a joke, let's talk as we eat.

744
2994
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,600
Yes.

745
2998
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:10,100
But then, CEO, you really can't joke.

746
3002
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,730
I always heard that was my charm.

747
3006
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,360
Yes.

748
3010
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:25,370
- I'm here.
 - Oh! Welcome.

749
3015
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:40,490
They don't have a menu board in here. Can I just order as I wish, Writer?

750
3019
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,170
Yes, of course. I'm fine with it.

751
3023
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:45,200
Uncle, we will have spring onion pancake and whelk soup.

752
3027
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,590
And rice wine, three bottles.

753
3031
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,060
Three bottles?

754
3035
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,540
Ahh. I'm sorry.

755
3039
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:54,460
Uncle! Four bottles!

756
3043
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:59,870
Tada.

757
3047
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:11,030
Writer, you drink deliciously.

758
3051
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,510
The drink is delicious today. Maybe it's because it's after a long while.

759
3055
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:19,540
Don't you drink with your husband?

760
3059
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:22,480
Ahh. My husband.

761
3063
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:27,920
We only drink beer while we watch soccer.

762
3067
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:32,260
He's a unique person.

763
3071
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:35,060
I have never seen him drunk.

764
3075
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:38,910
You must have been very careful with each other even though you are a married couple.

765
3079
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:42,870
Yes, that's right. We are very careful.

766
3083
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:48,400
He and I each have our own Room #19.

767
3087
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,200
Room #19?

768
3091
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,100
Yes.

769
3095
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:56,500
A place where we don't cross.

770
3099
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:00,990
Ahh. That's nice, a relationship like that.

771
3103
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:02,070
Really?

772
3107
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:03,770
Of course.

773
3111
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:06,600
Even married couples need something like that.

774
3115
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,610
When you love, all the more you have things you have to protect.

775
3119
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:19,340
CEO, why are you not married?

776
3123
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,180
Pardon? Me?

777
3127
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:23,880
Yes.

778
3131
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:27,800
Well, you are so pretty and strong.

779
3135
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,240
I'm just wondering why you aren't married yet.

780
3139
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,430
I'm just curious.

781
3143
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,470
Maybe all the more because I am married.

782
3147
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:41,230
Was it a rude question?

783
3151
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:46,080
No. I was also curious about that when I was young.

784
3155
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,580
"That Unni, why is she not married at her age?"

785
3159
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:54,780
That time, I thought marriage would happen eventually for sure.

786
3163
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,560
I did it once, something like a marriage.

787
3167
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:12,000
I once lived with someone who was a CC (campus couple) when I was in college.

788
3171
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:15,070
Living together?

789
3175
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:19,280
Whoa. That's cool.

790
3179
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:24,260
Well, it wasn't that kind of a cool living together.

791
3183
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:28,300
As we dated, we had a child.

792
3187
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:33,130
That's why we lived together with the thoughts of marriage.

793
3191
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:39,000
Aren't you curious as to what happened after?

794
3195
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:43,820
Yes. Honestly.

795
3199
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:50,760
Something went wrong with the child and we broke up.

796
3203
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:54,610
His family also opposed it.

797
3207
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:04,640
My, because you're so transparent, I'm becoming transparent too.

798
3211
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,060
This is why I should not drink with someone like you.

799
3215
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:17,000
I asked a needlessly rude question.

800
3219
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,820
That's okay.

801
3223
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:22,370
This is a benefit of growing old.

802
3227
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:26,530
Hurt, too, is a memory now.

803
3231
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,510
Here.

804
3235
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:41,770
<i>Somehow, I may have known that time.</i>

805
3239
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,760
Should we have a drink?

806
3243
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:58,550
<i>That this person is his Room #19.</i>

807
3247
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,980
<i>And also...</i>

808
3251
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:05,990
♫ <i>With air that is different from yesterday's</i> ♫

809
3255
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:10,190
♫ <i>everything's changed</i> ♫

810
3259
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:15,340
<i>Somehow he may have known too.</i>

811
3263
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:22,260
<i>Someday, he would have to face that room.</i>

812
3267
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:34,000
I knew it the moment I saw you.

813
3271
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,280
CEO is just my style.

814
3275
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,500
Is that so? Thanks.

815
3279
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,770
Since you said it like that,

816
3283
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:46,460
I feel really good.

817
3287
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:53,130
So, Writer. That bastard. Don't worry.

818
3291
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:57,340
I will teach him a lesson. Bad jerk!

819
3295
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,870
Those kinds of bastards. You just need to restrain him

820
3299
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:05,500
and cut that part of his body so he can't function as a man.

821
3303
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:11,270
CEO! You're crazy!

822
3307
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:13,760
Crazy! CEO!

823
3311
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,770
Writer! That hurts.

824
3315
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:20,010
CEO, I think we're almost there.

825
3319
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:24,470
Writer! Is this the right way?

826
3323
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:25,740
Yes.

827
3327
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,130
Oh! Here, here. You can just stop here.

828
3331
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,530
Yes.

829
3335
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,870
Writer, are you sure this is it?

830
3339
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:41,300
CEO, honestly...

831
3343
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:44,800
I need to use the restroom. I will go first.

832
3347
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,970
She's such a good person.

833
3351
01:14:56,970 --> 01:15:01,270
She seems like a good person, right?

834
3355
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:02,780
Yes.

835
3359
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:08,570
<i>Why do good people come all at once?</i>

<i>Your and my Room #19</i>

3411
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,990
<i>No matter how you say it she will be hurt. 
- Since Ji Ho is a transparent person.</i>

849
3416
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:33,110
<i>After having love, why does the hurt get bigger?</i>

850
3420
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:37,960
<i>Does me being Ji Ho's husband have an effect on you with her writing?</i>

851
3424
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,060
<i>I thought you were going to confess to Ji Ho.</i>

852
3428
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:44,290
<i>You said all three were cheezy.
 [CEO Ma, which is least cheezy to confess feelings? Shall we 1. get married now? 2. really become a married couple now? 3. really be together now?]</i>

853
3433
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:45,920
<i>What I was worried about was only one person.</i>

854
3437
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,740
<i>Let's...</i>
