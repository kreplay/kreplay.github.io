8
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,050
Stop. Yoon Ji Ho.

9
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,230
You can't...

10
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,420
stop crying?

11
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,790
Then...

12
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,760
let's go together.

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,040
It's okay to cry, so...

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,060
let's go together.

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,750
You beside me.

16
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,990
I will be with you.

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,630
<i>1988 the whole world is looking at South Korea.</i>

18
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,940
<i>1988 on the day that the world's festival was going to start</i>

19
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,640
<i>In Mom's belly I was getting prepared to be born.</i>

20
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,770
<i>That way, I became a 88er whom the world was looking at.</i>

21
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,610
<i>Born during the heyday of South Korea.</i>

22
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,110
<i>It was given that our family had a car</i>

23
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,070
<i>I spent my early childhood in this high growth and abundance.</i>

24
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,270
<i>In the midst of all that, I also changed my identity</i>

25
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,680
<i>From a citizen to an elementary student</i>

26
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,240
<i>Of course, trials came.</i>

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,080
<i>However there was hope.</i>

28
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,130
<i>If someone works hard, then they can stand again.</i>

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,660
<i>Your earnest dream will come true, I believed.</i>

30
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,980
<i>However that belief did not last long.</i>

31
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,690
<i>Then somehow the dreams now had ranks</i>

32
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,480
<i>we were not 88ers</i>

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,800
<i>but became 880 won generation.</i>

34
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,860
<i>The vote of the 20's had no strength</i>

35
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,750
<i>the world was no longer</i>

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,810
<i>paying attention to South Korea.</i>

37
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,850
<i>In the infinite war, the friends that bet their necks for specifications</i>

38
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,090
<i>Among that... I was a snail who dreamed.</i>

39
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,520
<i>Even if I'm slow, if I work hard</i>

40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,430
<i>my dreams would come true.</i>

41
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,980
<i>I persistently believed in that.</i>

42
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,570
<i>If I were to tell the 20-year-old me,</i>

43
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,520
<i>would that punk believe me?</i>

44
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,760
Bride and groom, enter.

45
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,570
Let's go.

46
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,890
<i>The 88er, Yoon JiHo who is now 30, instead of becoming a writer...</i>

47
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,300
<i>I held the man who gave me a discount on rent</i>

48
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,150
<i>I really</i>

49
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,490
<i>got married.</i>

50
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,050
<i>Because of the house.</i>

51
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,610
I'm taking the picture.

52
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,670
One, two.

53
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,050
It's done.

54
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,680
Aigoo. You have worked hard. You worked hard.

55
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,690
You worked hard.

56
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,190
Hey, stop crying.

57
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,640
If someone saw they would think you had a story with the groom.

58
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,280
And what about you? You're like a part-timer as a guest.

59
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,120
How could you not shed a single tear?

60
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,550
Coldhearted.

61
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,840
We will be taking a photo with the groom and bride's friends.

62
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,490
Hey, let's go for the picture.

63
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,640
Heol!<br>- Why?

64
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,800
Hey, let's hurry.

65
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,100
Hey, we jet off as soon as she takes the photo. Got it?

66
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,840
Are all your friends here?

67
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,340
Yes.

68
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,850
Se Hee-nim too?<br>- Yes.

69
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,210
CEO and the one wearing the shoes with heels, move to the bride's side.

70
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,660
- Me? <br> - Yes, you two.

71
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,490
- No! <br> - No!

72
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,710
This side is cramped.

73
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,520
This is not heels.

74
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,360
I ask for your cooperation for today's affair.

75
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,120
CEO, heels... hurry and move to the bride's side.

76
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,680
Now let's balance it out.

77
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,330
Here.

78
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,230
Now, okay.

79
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,720
Excuse me, heels and the tall girl, switch places.

80
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,810
I'm taking it. One, two.

81
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,690
Hey, your girlfriend.

82
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,330
Hyung...

83
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,800
Pretend you don't know when you meet my girlfriend since we haven't made up yet.

84
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,640
Okay, okay. But then the tall girl beside your girlfriend, do you know her too?

85
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,720
She's bestfriends with Rang so we are close.

86
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,640
No... then that 88er, that small brat blocked someone older.

87
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,990
Hyung... we'll just eat quietly and go. Don't pretend you know her. Seriously, okay?

88
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,210
Why would I pretend to know her? I'm a shy type.

89
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,770
Aigoo.

90
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,520
No one sits here, right?

91
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,370
There is.

92
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,360
There isn't.

93
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,600
Is that so? Then if you don't mind.

94
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,680
Hyung, wait!

95
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,890
Is it tasty?

96
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,580
Do you want to try?

97
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,850
It's tasty.

98
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,210
Hello.

99
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,420
We're meeting for the first time, right? After just hearing stories of each other.

100
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,340
Yes, hello. I've also heard a lot about you.

101
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,680
This is my friend Woo--

102
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,920
Soo Ji.

103
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,340
What? You know her?<br>- I don't.

104
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,770
Then how did you know?

105
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,930
No, it's just that she looks like a Soo Ji.

106
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,420
Clean, elegant and someone who would block someone

107
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,680
it's written on her face.

108
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
What?<br>- What?

109
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,980
We met through work once.

110
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,920
How are you, CEO Ma?

111
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,570
Aigoo, thanks to you, I am doing fine.

112
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,270
Maybe it's because of the change between seasons but I got a bad cold too.

113
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,030
I got blocked and my mental state is shaken too.

114
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,270
But still I am happy and such.

115
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,680
Soo Ji blocked.

116
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,210
It's Ji Ho!

117
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,780
You look good together!

118
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,870
Who knew our Ji Ho would be the first one to get married.

119
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,580
I know. It seems just like yesterday when she vomited after drinking in our rooftop room.

120
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,710
So the pigeons gathered up the next morning.

121
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,030
I had such a hard time.

122
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,920
And you pretended to be an eagle to try to chase them away.

123
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,180
Hey, that wasn't an eagle. I was a falcon.

124
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,240
But what has he been eating that he has a smudge?

125
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,300
That... it looks like pepper paste.

126
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,490
That's true, why is he going around smudged like that?

127
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,650
But then, why is pepper paste continuously dripping down his nose?

128
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,840
I know.

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,740
That pepper paste.

130
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,250
You must have really been tired.

131
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,590
The activities these past days have suddenly increased that's why.

132
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,080
I know.

133
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,450
So much that you had a nosebleed.

134
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,890
I thought bleeding on both nostrils only happens when you get beaten by someone.

135
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,500
It was chaotic as if I was beaten by someone.

136
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,110
A wedding... is not any match for any projects I developed.

137
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,330
It's all over now, so just hang in there a little bit more.

138
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,750
Yes.

139
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:30,440
I want to hurry and rest in our house.

140
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,450
What? Did I say something wrong?

141
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,000
N...no. I need to rinse this.

142
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,060
<i>I want to hurry and rest in our house.</i>

143
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,690
Our house.

144
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,790
It's because your body is on the low.

145
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,040
In times like that you need to put something in your mouth. Hurry and drink this.

146
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,090
Yes.

147
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,820
You need to take this with that.

148
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,250
Why are you so skinny?

149
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,850
What do you like? Do you eat snake soup?

150
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,290
Snake soup... I haven't tried it.

151
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,270
Right? People from Soeul don't usually eat it.

152
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,420
Then... what should I feed you?

153
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:05,410
That... Ji Ho is a strong person.

154
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,850
Pardon?<br>- I may not know much about her, but

155
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:18,510
when she decided to write and when she decided to stop writing

156
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,020
and also... marriage...

157
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,240
She decided it for herself.

158
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,370
Because even though she looks weak she is strong.

159
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,260
<i>She's someone with a well-designed brain. </i>

160
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,690
She will not make herself go through something that would make her miserable.

161
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,400
So, Ji Ho... as always

162
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,730
will chose the path towards her happiness.

163
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,700
And I, for as long as we are married, that decision

164
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,560
I will not hinder it.

165
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,920
The only thing I could promise is that.

166
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,690
For what?

168
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:26,740
Because it's not "I will make her happy," "I will protect her."

169
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,630
The promise I could give is only this.

170
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,740
What about that? It's right though.

171
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,480
Just because you are a couple, you are not in charge of the other's happiness.

172
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,250
How could you make another person happy?

173
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,250
When it's an era where making one's self happy is hard enough.

174
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,680
Not being a hindrance to the other is the best.

175
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,050
I like it a whole lot better than not having her to touch water.

176
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,910
I will make you snake soup later on.

177
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,720
Try it once.

178
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,250
Ahh... Snake soup?

179
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,090
It's delicious.

180
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,500
We are people who rose up from that hard times, in-law.

181
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,190
Yes, yes, that's right.

182
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,740
Because your son is born in such a good generation

183
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,030
they say it's hard and all.

184
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,720
Let's go now. Everyone is tired.

185
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,030
That's right, Dad. Let's go.<br>- Okay.

186
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,280
Even though she's a lacking daughter

187
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,010
please take care of her.

188
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,350
Yes. Yes. <br>- Don't worry.

189
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,820
Please take care of her.

190
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,540
Go home safely.

191
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,600
Unni! I'll be going.

192
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,150
Okay. I'm sorry, you're pregnant and all.

193
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,290
It's okay.

194
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,620
But then Unni, brother-in-law is SH.

195
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,280
Huh?

196
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,100
He's super handsome.

197
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,140
Then let's get going too.

198
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,750
Yes.

199
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,290
<i>He's super handsome.</i>

200
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,360
What's wrong?

201
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,730
Ah. I thought my nose might be bleeding again.

202
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,160
You have been sneaking glances at my face.

203
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,220
Is there something on my face?

204
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,440
No. That...

205
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,430
Mosquito... I think there is one.

206
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,980
In this weather?

207
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,610
I know.

208
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,560
That...

209
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,560
Thank you.

210
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,890
I heard from outside.

211
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,360
To my mom... for saying those

212
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,120
thank you.

213
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:46,310
I think she made you worry for no reason.

214
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,850
I should have settled it beforehand.

215
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,070
That... it's does not only concern you.

216
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,520
If the other end feels unsettled

217
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,870
then I thought I should be the one to explain it as the landlord.

218
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:10,120
And to put it bluntly, it's not concerning you only, it's our (concern).

219
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,010
Our concern?

220
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,170
Yes, it's "our" concern. Since it's a shared matter.

221
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,400
<i>[Episode 6] <br>Because It's Our First</i>

222
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,570
Auntie, is there a space? <br>- There's none.

223
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,550
Is that so?

224
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,240
Hey! You knew about it, right?

225
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,980
That this place is a famous one? Of course.

226
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,090
Ms. Ho Rang. Wow!

227
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,530
Oh!

228
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,190
How could we surprisingly meet by coincidence here?

229
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,550
Oh my! I know. Isn't Seoul so small?

230
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,310
I know. Well, since the land is small let's just sit together.

231
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,330
No, it's okay.

232
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,220
Aigoo! I'm so busy. Why are you blocking the way?

233
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,080
I'm sorry.<br>- Hurry and go in!

234
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,030
Let's go in. Why are you bothering her?

235
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,330
That's right. She says she's busy.

236
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,870
Here, cheers!<br>-Cheers!

237
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,300
Wow, one shot. Fighting!

238
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,540
Ms. Ho Rang, you are good at drinking somaek (soju+beer). Based on your looks it doesn't seem like it.

239
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,490
I originally can't but these days I drink well. I broke up with my boyfriend.

240
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,330
Is that so? So you broke up with your boyfriend. What do we do?

241
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,760
I should register with you.

242
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,000
Well, if it's someone with your looks, it would be an honor.

243
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,060
What style of man do you want?

244
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,560
I'm not picky with anything, he just needs to be not an engineering graduate.

245
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,920
Aha! Engineering... He's...

246
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,020
Something bad must have happened with some one who's an engineer.

247
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,870
What did the engineering guy do so wrong...

248
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,180
please ask her that so we can listen.

249
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,170
You heard it, right?

250
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,850
What's the use of saying when we already broke up... please tell him that.

251
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,370
No, you two, why are you doing this to me?

252
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,400
Hey. Stop it.

253
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I hope in the next life he learns the language of humans, please tell him that too.

254
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,930
Because I think he sucks at it in this lifetime.

255
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,500
Yang Ho Rang! Seriously!

256
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,530
Seriously what!

257
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,890
I tried to understand you. But you were too much this time, you know?

258
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,710
What were you trying to understand?

259
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,760
How are you going to understand me?

260
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,330
Hey, don't put on that twisted smile. That's what I hate the most.

261
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,900
Do you even know even just a bit about the reason why I was mad!

262
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,070
I also know the real reason!

263
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,980
I also know. I also know why you were so mad.

264
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,830
Now, now. Calm down.

265
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,520
Honestly, Won Seok was so in distress knowing that.

266
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,780
The real reason why you got mad.

267
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,610
It was because he bought the sofa that was on display.

268
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,490
Pardon?

269
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,410
That... because that was a sofa on display so dirt would be stuck on it.

270
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,210
He wiped it so hard that

271
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,990
he has muscles here already.

272
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,430
CEO Ma, that mouth please.

273
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,890
So he can save those few delivery dollars, he dragged that up all the way from the station.

274
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,130
- With all his body devoted to it. <br>- Can you close your mouth now?

275
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,620
Ms. Ho Rang.

276
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,990
Won Seok really tried his best.

277
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,600
In the end,

278
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,550
this is the reasoning you came up with?

279
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:35,330
That I'm mad because you got my the couch that was on display?

280
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,390
What?

281
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:45,580
I..I guess that's how ignorant you saw me as.

282
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,980
Even though we've been dating for 7 years...

283
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,200
- No- Ho Rang. Ho Rang. <br>- Ho Rang..

284
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,490
What happened, Hyung? Get up.

285
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,310
Ho Rang! Ho Rang!

286
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,510
Ho Rang! Ho Rang!

287
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,890
Hey, Yang Ho Rang, seriously!

288
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,300
It wasn't that either? Then what was it?

289
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,950
You...

290
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,940
Did you see me receiving Ji Ho's bouquet today?

291
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,110
Yes, I saw it earlier. I even saw how you almost fell just to catch that.

292
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:35,960
Rang, don't brush around the bush and just tell me why are you mad. Okay?

293
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,740
Do you know that if you catch the bouquet,

294
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,900
you will get married in 6 months?

295
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,110
Why are you spouting suddenly?

296
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:50,290
Stop brushing around the bush. Let's just drop this, okay?

297
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,760
If you catch the bouquet

298
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,530
and you don't get married in 6 months,

299
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,980
then you won't be able to for the next 3 years.

300
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,920
Why do you keep saying useless stuff, crazy head? Rang..

301
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,640
That's not important right now.

302
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,440
Oh my gosh!

303
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,460
Aish! Yang Ho Rang, are you seriously crazy?! What's wrong with you?!

304
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,190
Marriage!!!

305
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,110
I'm saying that I want to get married, you idiot!

306
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,120
Marriage..

307
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,690
I, seriously! It switched from a full-on combat to a melodrama in a blink of second. Marriage!

308
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:55,640
Oh, Ho Rang! That wasn't just some story reversal but to the level of genre wreckage!

309
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,820
You must have not date a lot, right?

310
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,880
What? Dating?

311
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,680
Ah, seriously. I'm speechless.

312
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,290
Do you know why my name is Ma Sang Goo, Deputy Woo?

313
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,830
Since I was 18, I've never had a dating jinx.

314
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,400
Ma Sang Goo.

315
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,450
I mean, besides texting back and forth. Real dating.

316
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,750
When you're not clear if she's your family or your friend, or if she's you or you are her, and you feel pinched and muddled.

317
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,950
You've never spent over an year like that with someone, right? Like those two earlier?

318
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,420
I've seen the case of is this your leg or is it my leg often.

319
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,700
No, then have you dated those type of guys before?

320
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,900
The "real dating".

321
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,860
I don't do stuff like that. Because it's stressful.

322
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,730
I don't date men. I only create memories with them.

323
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,220
I'm going to catch a taxi this way, what about you?

324
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,500
What is wrong with him? Seriously..

325
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,200
Hello.

326
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,920
What are you doing?

327
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,040
Your daughter. She was crying in there so I rescued her.

328
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,050
- What the heck? <br>- What do you mean what? She's your exact replica.

329
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,620
- No need. Take it back.<br>- Keep it. Keep it.

330
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,410
You said you only make memories with guys.

331
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,620
This is today's memory, so take it. Okay?

332
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:57,870
And also, from human to human, could you stop cutting me out?

333
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,720
I won't send you spamming texts anymore.

334
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,420
Okay?! Okay, leave.

335
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,090
Looks like me? Yeah right!

336
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:37,830
Ji Ho . . . and the youngest girl at my work got married too.

337
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,290
Ji Ho married too and the youngest girl at your work married too.

338
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:47,430
I got it. I got it. Stop crying and just sleep.

339
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,240
If you continue to cry, your head will hurt.

340
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,810
I got it. Let's sleep.

341
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,100
I got it. I got it.

342
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,460
Stop crying.

343
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,820
Don't cry.

344
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,830
- You're awake?<br>- Yeah.

345
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,510
You made a good breakfast.

346
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,660
Yes, I'm a type of person who has to have breakfast.

347
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,430
Also, since this is our first day after the wedding.

348
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,080
Yes.

349
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,290
Then, enjoy the food.

350
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,950
You should at least eat the food and then leave.

351
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,130
Ah..I'm alright.

352
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,960
Still...

353
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,050
it's the first official day after the end of the project.

354
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,880
I did make a lot too so we could eat together.

355
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:35,020
Then, I'll eat just a bit.

356
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,860
Ah, okay!

357
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,590
♫ <i>What I need to do</i> ♫

358
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,730
I'll enjoy the food.

359
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,520
♫ <i>I don't want to spend my emotion </i> ♫

360
00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:01,960
♫ <i>Love to someone like me is an useless emotion</i> ♫

361
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,890
♫ <i>Though I tell myself that</i> ♫

362
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:12,370
♫ <i>when you are in front of me</i> ♫

363
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,860
♫ <i>walking by </i> ♫

364
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,840
It's delicious.

365
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,130
Yes.

366
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,730
I know. I'm good at cooking.

367
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,100
Yes. You really are.

368
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,030
It's a good thing to be skilled in.

369
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,240
♫ <i>Then I want to hold your hand </i> ♫

370
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,600
Besides ramen, this is our first time

371
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,360
eating together like this.

372
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,090
You're right.

373
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,130
What did you do yesterday?

374
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,650
Yesterday?

375
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,760
I went home and washed up and went to bed after watching some soccer.

376
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,720
Soccer? The two of you together?

377
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,490
No, we were tired yesterday so we each watched on our phone in our own room.

378
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,760
Your own rooms? You guys sleep in different rooms?

379
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,130
I mean, our own phones. We watched on our own phones, I mean.

380
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,130
Hey, try this. It's so good.

381
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,410
It's alright. You should be eating it as a newlywed. You'll need the energy.

382
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,000
When is he the sexiest?

383
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,280
You're newlyweds. They say, you get in the mood suddenly without warning in the newlywed phase.

384
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,730
I don't. There's nothing like that.

385
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,420
Ji Ho. Are you guys sexless, by chance?

386
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,090
No, not like that either.

387
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,270
Not like that either then why are you so stingy about telling it?

388
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,330
I fessed up to you about all the men I've met all these years.

389
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,460
But you won't tell me a thing about your husband.

390
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,960
When he says "our".

391
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,260
I like it when he uses the word "our".

392
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:02,010
When he say things like, "our house" and "our work"

393
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,060
I felt really nice.

394
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:10,500
So you mean . . . when he says 'our' you get all excited?

395
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,130
That's your fetish?

396
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,670
It's not like that.

397
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,930
What's Ji Ho's fetish?

398
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:18,600
- It's not a fetish but . . .<br>- She gets all excited when he says "we".

399
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,240
Indeed, a writer's fetish is literary too.

400
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,290
- We? <br>- We!

401
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,980
But where you headed Ji Ho, to be out here, the first day after being married?

402
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,620
I'm going to find a part-time job.

403
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,290
What? A part-time job? Why?

404
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,010
Huh?

405
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:40,200
Oh. I should work to pay for rent . . .

406
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,990
I mean . . . to pay for living cost and cellphone cost too.

407
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,100
Hey! Isn't brother-in-law too much!

408
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,850
What, why?

409
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,740
I mean, how can he let her go work part-time when they're married?

410
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,710
Hey, these days, you can't live on one income together.

411
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,730
You're not going to work after you're married then?

412
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,830
I will. House work.

413
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,630
Have kids and serve my husband's parents too.

414
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,490
Hey, you know that stuff needs to be done with a pro mindset too?

415
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,660
What did Won Seok say?

416
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,180
Did he response to your sassy proposal?

417
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,230
What response? Is he in the position to respond?

418
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,400
When he made a girl bring up marriage first.

419
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,990
I woke up and he was already out and gone. I guess he knew he was in the wrong too.

420
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,610
Ho Rang. Are you sure Won Seok is even thinking of marrying you?

421
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,420
What?

422
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,060
I mean, have you ever talked about it seriously?

423
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,390
About the two of you getting married?

424
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,990
Talk about what?

425
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,810
Woo Soo Ji. We've dated for seven years!

426
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,820
So if he isn't even thinking about marriage, is he even human?

427
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,690
He'd be trash.

428
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,660
You should just get married.

429
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,100
Even a personality like that gets married so why couldn't you?

430
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,470
But he's got a job and he's got a home too.

431
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,030
Me, even if I get married, where would I live?

432
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,350
I can't show Rang's parents the rooftop room.

433
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,570
Still no investments yet?

434
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,850
I'm supposed to meet them later.

435
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,280
But I don't really know. I think I might end up having to wrap it up after only getting a taste of it.

436
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,270
Listen to this without misunderstanding.

437
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,120
Do you want to just come into my company?

438
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,290
I mean, I know you're the CEO of your APP too.

439
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,920
But it'd be easier to get married if you belonged somewhere.

440
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,110
Thank you, but I still should see to the end of what I'm doing.

441
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,640
There's the time I've invested in it too.

442
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,470
And more than anything else, I'm not sure what marriage is.

443
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,550
Do you know? Marriage?

444
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,820
Huh?

445
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,040
I don't know.

446
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,870
I think it's a good thing? Two is better than one, right?

447
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,730
Someone who'd always be understanding no matter what I do.

448
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,490
To have that same person by my side always.

449
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,340
Isn't something like that something good?

450
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,950
Why happened to you suddenly? How did you get all greasy?

451
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,880
Maybe there's someone of that sort these days?

452
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,680
Someone magnificent, kid!

453
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,200
Chief Nam. What is getting married?

454
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,830
What is getting married, Mr. Married?

455
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,440
Is it nice being married, Ahjussi?

456
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,700
I told you to start talking to me while I'm working, right?

457
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,770
Because of you, my logic got scattered.

458
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,690
Alright, friend.

459
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:37,010
Also. Don't talk about personal stuff at work.

460
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,390
Okay.

461
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:51,630
It seems a human being can actually spit at you with their eyes.

462
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,720
He's someone without any common awareness.

463
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,750
Even a punk like him can get married, so why couldn't we?

464
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,010
You look so young for your age.

465
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,770
Compared to your looks, your age is . . . maybe you're preparing to take some exams?

466
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,900
Nothing like that. I am just taking a break for a while.

467
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,800
I see. At your age?

468
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,690
So you were a writer before?

469
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,610
Yes, as a drama assistant writer.

470
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,110
Assistant writer?

471
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,710
There's such a thing?

472
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,550
I think it'd be difficult at our shop.

473
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:29,420
To be honest, we're looking for 20-something's.

474
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,820
I'm sorry.

475
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,340
Yes.

476
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,720
<i>Part-time help wanted</i>

477
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,980
Ack, this is bad.

478
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,470
Oh, your part-time . . .

479
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:51,420
Bok Nam! Bok Nam! Where did that punk go?

480
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,880
- You're here to find a part-time job?<br>- Ah, yes.

481
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,610
- Boss? <br>- Yes, just a second please.

482
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,990
It's so busy here. Where did he go!?

483
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,000
Can you help me find Bok Nam out in the front?

484
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,200
Who is Bok Nam?

485
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,590
He's a kid of ours but he went out while I was in the kitchen I think.

486
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,510
I should get him tied up around the neck or something.

487
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,480
- He went out alone? <br>- This is what he looks like.

488
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,280
He's got brown fur here. And curly.

489
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,290
Pink colored clothes. He likes corners. So if you look around those places, he's probably there.

490
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,090
Brown color. Curly. Pink color.

491
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,260
<i>Boss, aren't you going to take our order here?</i>

492
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,110
When you see him. He's pretty.

493
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,420
Please do me the favor.

494
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,520
Yes, coming. Just a second.

495
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,530
Bok Nam?

496
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Bok Nam?

497
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,800
Bok Nam?

498
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,500
I forgot to ask him what kind of a dog.

499
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,070
Brown poodle?

500
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,680
Bok Nam?

501
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:07,600
Bok Nam? Bok Nam? Bok Nam?

502
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,730
Bok Nam?

503
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,420
Bok Nam?

504
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,530
What are you looking for?

505
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,980
Oh.

506
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,650
The puppy that the shop up front raises.

507
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,180
I think he went out alone without the owner.

508
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,930
His name is Bok Nam.

509
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,670
Oh, Bok Nam?

510
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,570
By chance, did you see him?

511
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:41,110
Curly and brown fur.

512
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,260
Pink colored clothes.

513
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,250
When you look at him, he's pretty.

514
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,040
He said pretty?

515
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,260
Yes.

516
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,940
I think so.

517
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,220
Oh.

518
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,220
You saw him?

519
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,040
No.

520
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,860
Then.

521
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,550
Wait.

522
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,830
Give me your number.

523
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,880
Why?

524
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,560
I'll call you when I find the dog. Then I'll need your number.

525
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,110
Oh. Yes.

526
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:22,310
The name doesn't sound like he's pretty. Bok Nam.

527
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:32,950
But why did I give him my number when I don't know him?

528
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,520
Come on in.

529
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,780
Oh no. I didn't find him. Bok Nam.

530
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,600
He came back on his own feet. Just a little while ago.

531
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,220
Really?

532
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,840
What a relief. But where . . .

533
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,090
Have a seat. You said you were looking for a part-time job, right?

534
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,920
Oh, yes.

535
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,470
Thanks for helping me find Bok Nam.

536
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,050
He often likes to go out and roam around.

537
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,960
But you named him so well. Bok Nam.

538
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,970
You brought your resume?

539
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,160
Oh, yes, of course.

540
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,820
<i>Bok Nam</i>

541
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:24,810
Oh, right. Earlier, someone named Deputy Park called to tell you they've got a company dinner tonight.

542
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:30,690
Those rascals! What era are we living in now? Isn't that too obvious? They're asking me to pay for their company meal!

543
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,950
Deputy Park? It's that Deputy Park from Felix, right? That rascal.

544
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,630
Nope. Deputy Park from HK.

545
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,120
HK?

546
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,300
Oh, they're having their company dinner then.

547
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,500
Where and what time, how . . .

548
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,220
I sent it to you by messenger.

549
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,970
Oh-ya?

550
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:53,640
But how come it's always just me with this chained up heavy feeling?

551
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,620
By account of age and by account of social position, isn't this heaviness something you should be carrying?

552
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,560
It's Se Hee's wife!

553
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,320
Oh, sister-in-law!

554
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,000
Oh. Hello.

555
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,210
What brings you here? Oh, you must be here to see Se Hee.

556
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,850
Oh. No. I had an errand near by and somehow . . .

557
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,560
That's great. It's our snack time. Come on in and share it with us.

558
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,300
No, I should go home.

559
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,720
But it'd be nice if you came with us.

560
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,940
Make yourself at home, sister-in-law. This is your first time here, right?

561
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,640
- Yes. <br>- How is it?<br>- It's so great!

562
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,490
Yes, I put some thought into it.

563
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,100
Oh, Se Hee is in a meeting right now, but it'll be done soon.

564
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,430
This is Chief Nam's seat.

565
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,160
Look around and I'll go prepare this.

566
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,350
Sister-in-law, fighting! I love it!

567
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,680
<i>It's Me</i>

568
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,590
<i>It's Me (bulletin board)</i>

569
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,870
<i>Ma Sang Gu<br>- Desired nickname: Mably.<br>- Desired salary: Immeasurable.<br>- Likes: Women and Working into the night. <br>- Dislikes: Yolo.</i>

570
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,100
<i>Nam Se Hee<br>- Desired nickname: None.<br>- Desired salary: Enough to pay back the loan before retiring.<br>- Likes: Cat.<br>- Dislikes: Stuff like this. </i>

571
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,270
Didn't you clearly say last week that there wasn't any?

572
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:28,960
I asked you if there were any edits to be made in the final draft. Twice.

573
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,910
Oh. That's . . . it's because it's linked to so many aspects.

574
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:38,050
I'm supposed to know each and every detail like that?

575
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,790
You should've balanced that up in advance.

576
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,220
Yes. Though that's true.

577
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,570
From now on, matters of such low priority like this.

578
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,780
I hope you never come break my work over something like that.

579
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,440
Yes, I understand.

580
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,900
- Eat up. <br> - Thank you!

581
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,780
This isn't a hologram, is it?

582
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,480
The day has come in my lifetime to see Se Hee's wife.

583
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,490
Is it alright if I take a picture?

584
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,930
Sure, my-

585
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,840
Ah, pretty.

586
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,800
But why are you taking my pic-?

587
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,840
You are Se Hee's ideal type so I wanted to record this date.

588
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,100
Ideal type?

589
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:37,050
He said that to the President. He married you because you are pretty.

590
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:43,270
This is the first time I heard a male using such a flashy term about a woman. Extremely.

591
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,790
Extremely pretty. I'm telling you!

592
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,180
So unexpected.

593
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:55,690
It's so nice that you visited, Jiho. We're trembling with excitement.

594
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,570
That's right.

595
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,020
Come by often, Sister-in-Law.

596
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,800
This,

597
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,290
have one. <br>- So dirty, touching with bare hands.

598
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,510
Have this.

599
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,030
Have a lot.

600
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,350
Thank you.

601
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,020
Let's do a wave, starting with me and moving to the right.

602
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,980
Shall we leave now?

603
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,030
No, let's stay a bit longer.

604
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,240
Oh, CEO!

605
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:44,060
Oh, CEO!

606
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,420
Come over here.

607
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,780
What team dinner do you have today?

608
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:57,350
It's the last day for the newbies so I wanted to buy them a drink.

609
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,240
Nice to meet you.

610
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,590
This is Gyeolmalae's CEO, Ma Sang Goo. Claps!

611
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,030
Claps!

612
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,730
As Gyeolmalae's representative, Ma Sang Gu, cheers for dating!

613
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,030
Fighting!

614
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,700
Let's have a glass.

615
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,640
Since he's here, let move to another place.

616
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,520
You can go to the good beef restaurant next door.

617
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,940
Ok! Let's head to the beef place.

618
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,340
I'll settle the bill.

619
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,810
On this, please.

620
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,910
What are you doing? I was going to pay.

621
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,220
Why would you? We're the ones that drank.

622
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,360
- Please give me the receipt.<br>- It's $206.

623
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,770
Please sign here.

624
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:55,450
At least play the claw machine game with that money.

625
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,780
Here.

626
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,230
- Work hard. <br>- Thank you, goodbye.

627
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,530
What is that woman playing at?

628
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:10,800
Is it an appeal of charm? To make me fall for her?

629
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:13,590
The card. Work hard.

630
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:17,810
Welcome and cheers!

631
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,490
I added you, check it.

632
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:27,980
Assistant manager, we're friends now.

633
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,720
Who says we're friends?

634
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,460
- Assistant Manager Kim.<br>- Yes?

635
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,690
Why didn't you accept my invite? I think it's been two weeks.

636
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:44,190
Really? I didn't know.

637
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:46,440
Check it now.

638
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,260
Later.

639
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,660
You don't friend married guys?

640
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:56,750
No, it's not that.

641
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,890
Assistant Manager Park. I was also recently dumped by an employee.

642
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,660
"What CEO sends a friend request?!"

643
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:07,530
It must be work culture these days.

644
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,890
Let's not send or accept friend requests among work people.

645
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,030
That employee was female right?

646
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,760
Yes, she was.

647
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,030
Women are like that.

648
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,930
In that case, there's must be a load of pictures with her boyfriend.

649
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:29,160
If not, then what the heck is the reason for not accepting?

650
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,300
Right, totally.

651
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:36,160
Fine, I'll accept it.

652
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,600
Our Assistant Manager Woo is totally cool!

653
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,640
In exchange, you can't erase your bikini pictures taken at the hotel.

654
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,710
Another shot!

655
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,010
Smoke?

656
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,790
Why are you like that?

657
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:27,130
Why do you hold it in even after hearing those trashy words?

658
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,170
CEO Ma. Be careful.

659
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:42,560
Hey! You might not know as a CEO but

660
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,870
to a salaried worker like me this is a regular part of work life.

661
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,890
It'd be a real nice scene for the newbies if I fought with Assistant Manager in there.

662
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:52,730
That's why you must bring it up, because your juniors are there!

663
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:56,020
- They should know not to behave that way! <br>- Why me?

664
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,690
Have you ever tried working as woman in a corporation?

665
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:04,150
If it becomes a big deal for nothing, I'm the one they'll gossip about.

666
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:10,100
So please don't worry about someone else's worker, CEO Ma.

667
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:26,270
CEO Ma, he seems so much more fun after talking to him.

668
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,220
Does he?

669
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,790
Did you see Bomi's expression earlier?

670
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:35,320
When CEO Ma hid the sandwich

671
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,200
he was somewhat cute.

672
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,100
I see.

673
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:48,470
Do you know that going home together like this

674
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,230
It's our first time.

675
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,530
Is that so?

676
00:48:55,550 --> 00:49:00,730
While living in Seoul, everything was ok but

677
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:05,460
Strangely I hated having to go home by myself.

678
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:10,360
I had vaguely imagined it in school.

679
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,370
If I got married, I would be going home together with someone.

680
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,960
Then that would be so lovely.

681
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,870
Yes

682
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:31,490
Woori.

683
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:34,730
You were bored weren't you?

684
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,960
Ah, I gave her a name.

685
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,420
Woori.

686
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:56,790
I thought it would be nice if it had a name.

687
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:02,660
To keep calling the cat Kitty is sought of.. what should I say...

688
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:09,090
It's similar to my mom telling me, "Primate, come eat."

689
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:27,650
You don't like the name?

690
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,370
Rather than disliking it,

691
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,800
I find it burdensome.

692
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,530
Rather than disliking it,

693
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,740
I find it a bit burdensome.

694
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,760
Burdensome?

695
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,400
Yes, It's my cat but,

696
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,370
Having someone call it by another name is bothersome.

697
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,300
Ah, right.

698
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,160
You could feel like that.

699
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:21,670
Then, the fact that I went to you office today

700
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:25,400
must have been bothersome too.

701
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:32,660
Yes it was .

702
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:35,600
Ok.

703
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,230
Right?

704
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,100
Without another option we chose marriage but

705
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,040
expecting a deeper relationship than home owner and tennant

706
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,790
is truthfully uncomfortable for me.

707
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:53,050
Situations where we have to play a couple in front of others,

708
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:57,650
I'd like to avoid them if possible.

709
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:03,070
Yes. I'll do that.

710
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,840
That's the right thing.

711
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,040
Right.

712
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,820
I'll do that from now on.

713
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,530
Then..

714
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,490
I have to trim its toenails.

715
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,030
Sure.

716
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:48,820
<i>Ho Rang, are you sure Won Seok has marriage thoughts with you?</i>

717
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,660
<i>So have you guys ever talked seriously </i>

718
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:54,100
<i>about wanting to marry each other.</i>

719
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,120
You're here?

720
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,710
Ah, I'm so tired. Seriously.

721
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,500
You had the meeting with the investors today, right?

722
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,150
You've worked hard.

723
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,010
Yeah, I worked really hard today.

724
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:18,860
I mean, is anyone and everyone all Steve Jobs?

725
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,930
They're all telling me to start from the garage. Are we in America?

726
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,250
I don't even have a car. What garage would I have?

727
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,990
I'm so comfortable.

728
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,710
- Seok. <br>- Yeah?

729
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,060
About our marriage...

730
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,770
Yeah?

731
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,660
What do you think about it?

732
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,370
- My opinion?<br>- Yeah.

733
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:58,150
I don't think I ever talked about it officially before.

734
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,990
Do you also want to get married?

735
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,910
You see..

736
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,790
Honestly, I still don't know.

737
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:15,680
You don't know...

738
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,260
You know...I really love you

739
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:26,180
and want to live with you, which is why I'm living here with you,

740
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,840
but...

741
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,370
I still don't know about marriage.

742
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,630
You said you love me, though...

743
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:42,260
Of course. You also know that without you, I can't live.

744
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,500
However, there's a lot more than just marrying each other out of love.

745
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:53,740
- What? <br>- We have to raise kids and take a lot of responsible once we get married.

746
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,130
But right now, I can't even get secure investment.

747
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,450
then how can I do such thing?

748
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,790
I guess you have thought about this before..

749
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:15,450
Yeah, I've been giving that a lot of thoughts lately and worrying about it, too.

750
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:19,960
Rang...are you disappointed?

751
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:25,450
N-No. I can become worrisome, too.

752
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:28,010
Since dating and marriage are different...

753
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:29,810
Right?

754
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:33,130
So that why I said, it's quite hard.

755
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:38,310
Rang, I sometime think about that, too.

756
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:44,170
Is loving each other and marriage the same thing?

757
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:51,630
<i>Those ill-fated 1988 births.</i>

758
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:02,020
<i>Born during South Korea's most speculator time.</i>

759
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,220
<i>The generation that is experiencing the worst vagrancy.</i>

760
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,920
<i>The generation that has tasted abundance and destitution at the same time.</i>

761
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,580
<i>So, we are</i>

762
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,900
<i>- Honey Honey!! I love you!<br>- I love you, Yang Ho Rang.</i>

763
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,230
<i>Why we are called the 'ill-fated' 1988 births.</i>

764
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:22,560
<i>To us, both marriage </i>

765
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,080
<i>and dating and "we" </i>

766
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,350
<i>and all the whatever's are not givens to us.</i>

767
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,640
<i>I'm sorry. It's because I'm an old geezer.</i>

768
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,100
<i>No.</i>

769
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,190
<i>Even ordinary things like bonding and romance,<br> </i>

770
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:58,860
<i>have become expenses and energies. </i>

771
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,000
<i>So..</i>

772
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,500
<i>I must've been mistaken for a moment.</i>

773
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,240
<i>I'll stay with you.</i>

774
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,070

775

<i>Our stituation?</i>

776
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:17,280
<i>Yes, it's our situation.</i>

777
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,300
<i>Your words</i>

778
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:24,020
<i>made me thought I can become comfortable.</i>

779
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,870
<i>I thought</i>

780
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,030

<i>for a moment.</i>

♫ <i> Come with me </i> ♫

785
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:07,760
You made some delicious breakfast today again.

786
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:29,180
It was obvious that I did go overboard about yesterday.

787
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,920
What? Well, it's fine-

788
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,430
I think that I've been a little bit out of it after I quit my job.

789
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,290
I'm sorry I was an nuisance.

790
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:49,170
Honestly,

791
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:53,210
it's been such a long time since I heard the word, "our".

792
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,690
"Our house"..."our neighborhood"...

793
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:02,480
It's hard to hear those type of words nowadays.

794
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:06,490
It had been too long to felt like I belonged somewhere.

795
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,320
I was a bit overboard.

796
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,220
I must have mistaken about

797
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:18,920
being in a "our" relationship between house owner and tenant.

798
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:31,190
So from now on, don't say "our" so easily.

799
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,210
Because it makes me misunderstand.

800
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:40,000
Yes. I understand.

801
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,700

01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:05,730
