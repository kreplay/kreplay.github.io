8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,450
Yup, Ji Ho. I'm here.

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,630
Yup, take your time.

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,510
Welcome.

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,660
You two met first.

12
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,280
You're here?

13
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,670
What is this? You said you and I, the two of us, would eat.

14
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,980
Who should be saying that? You didn't say she'd come.

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,960
If I told you beforehand, both of you wouldn't have come out.

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,730
But why are you guys sitting side by side?

17
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,230
If we sit across, I'd have to look at her face.

18
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,160
What the heck.

19
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,280
You know what? I...

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,030
I called you guys to come to tell you something.

21
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,910
Tell us what?

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,670
It's something I must tell you with you both here together.

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,040
So first, let's do this.

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,390
You each have a glass of water first.

25
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,370
What is it? Did something happen?

26
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,220
What is this? It's making me uneasy. What is it?

27
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,880
You know what, girls?

28
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,380
I . . .

29
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,850
As for the Natural Uni part, we'll calculate it after SU.

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,200
Yes, Chief Nam?

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
At our last company dinner, during the third round,

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,750
who all made bets on my sexuality?

35
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,840
What? What bets? Why would we do such a thing?

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,460
We quit betting.

37
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,500
Are we such idle folks with nothing to do?

38
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,550
Oh, this is outrageous.

39
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,580
Those who bet on me being homosexual?

40
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,240
That I am heterosexual?

41
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,550
Asexual?

42
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,140
Congratulations, Bo Mi.

43
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,830
I am getting married.

44
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,550
Do what?

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Nam, Chief Nam?

46
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,850
What did he say he was going to do?

47
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,360
- He's getting married. <br>- Getting married?

48
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,590
Everyone, pay up. Fifty bucks.

49
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,910
Here, Chief Nam? Shall we have a quick talk?

50
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:25,050
By chance, is this because we made bets behind your back, and you are doing this as a way to mess with us?

51
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,760
Is that It? It is, right?

52
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,890
Did you pay the fifty bucks?

53
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,170
Hey. You're getting married? Getting married for real?

54
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,130
Marriage? Wedding? Marriage as in the four rituals of coming of age, marriage, funeral, and ancestral rites?

55
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,930
Yup.

56
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,660
With a woman, this getting married of yours?

57
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,800
Yup.

58
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,930
Stop joking! How can you get married? You're asexual. How can you get married?

59
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,200
You thought I'd believe that? That's a fake marriage, right?

60
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,970
Punk! You can fool someone else, but you can't fool me!

61
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,460
She's pretty.

62
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,070
- Oh, she's pretty? <br>- Yup.

63
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,880
Very.

64
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,100
So, Se Hee's fallen in love.

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,480
Se Hee finally knows love!

66
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,370
You're getting...

67
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,970
Married, you said?

68
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,110
With your landlord?

69
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,990
Is it shocking?

70
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,510
Since when did you guys start to date?

71
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,110
Dating?

72
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,000
As for dating, it's been about one or two months.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,120
Then, you guys started dating since you moved in?

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,410
Pretty much.

75
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,870
You started to date then, you said?

76
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,050
Yup, starting then.

77
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,770
But why didn't you tell us?

78
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,920
Last time, you said there's no relationship between you and him.

79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,510
She did, right?

80
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,180
Yes, she did. Though it was suspicious since you were so adamant.

81
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,720
That's because it hadn't been too long at the time.

82
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,460
I was kind of embarrassed to tell you guys. That's why.

83
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,990
But you're marrying him even though it hasn't been too long?

84
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,550
Yeah. You know...

85
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,910
There are lots of people who marry after only two or three months of knowing each other.

86
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,300
That's other people. Not other people, but Ji Ho, you?

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,820
What about me?

88
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,210
I mean, it takes a few months for you to befriend someone.

89
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,420
You're leapfrogging over the introduction straight to marriage, and that's what's weird.

90
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,070
Isn't it weird?

91
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,160
Relationships between people aren't always about how long they've known each other, though.

92
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,500
So what I mean is . . .

93
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,920
Even though the time of knowing each other is short if it's someone you feel that you really need in life—

94
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,680
Need?

95
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,720
Oh.

96
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,660
Need might be a strange word to use on a person.

97
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,050
So what I mean is . . .

98
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,430
I know! I know why you're getting married.

99
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,330
Huh?

100
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,320
Ji Ho, you . . .

101
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,630
fell for him at first sight, huh?

102
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,870
As soon as you met him, you fell for him, right?

103
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,820
You know in the dramas and movies, how you are knocked out at first sight. That's it, right?

104
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,930
Yup, correct.

105
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,810
Correct?

106
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,700
Well, it's like that somehow.

107
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,680
It was seriously like, knocked out at first sight.

108
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,190
So you're suddenly marrying him too?

109
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,790
Yup.

110
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,650
I think it's fated.

111
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,420
Omo.

112
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,690
Oh my.

113
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,970
<i>I think it's fated.</i>

114
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,620
You're seriously crazy.

115
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,480
Since you're a drama writer? Here comes an actress!

116
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,620
Let's go. This way.

117
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,870
So were you able to tell the people at your work?

118
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,760
Yes. Coincidentally, we had a meeting with the entire staff, so I was able to resolve it in one go.

119
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,180
What about your colleagues that you thought would be difficult?

120
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,740
That was surprisingly resolved with one go as well,

121
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,790
using the weak nature of male evolution.

122
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,470
What?

123
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,450
What about you, Ji Ho?

124
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,400
Since they are such long-time friends of yours, it might be difficult for them to understand.

125
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,760
Well, mine was also surprisingly in one go...

126
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,550
What method did you use?

127
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,770
Well... fa(te).

128
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,580
Huh?

129
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,180
I was lucky.

130
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,420
I used some strategy in storytelling.

131
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,150
Who would've thought having been a drama writer would come to be helpful in times like this.

132
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,170
I see.

133
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,330
<i>Nam Hee Bong</i>

134
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,080
Then, shall we go in?

135
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,250
Um. Will you be alright?

136
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,930
Yes. I will give it a good try.

137
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,740
Since your mother was a viewer of my drama, it shouldn't be hard.

138
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,430
Your father—

139
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,330
My father?

140
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,000
You can just not worry about him.

141
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,250
<i>My landlord's mother. Jo Myeong Ja.</i>

142
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,560
<i>From Seoul Jongro district. Born in 1955.</i>

143
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,390
<i>A homemaker who wants to be viewed as a good wife and wise mother who is affable. </i>

144
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,990
You're here, son.

145
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,260
Have you been well?

146
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,390
<i>She is inclined to see her son getting married a day sooner than later. </i>

147
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,520
<i>The typical mother character, who is trying to reclaim the peace in the family for the sake of maintaining stability.</i>

148
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,390
This is Ji Ho that I mentioned to you.

149
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,640
- Hello. <br>- You're here.

150
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,120
Was it difficult getting here?

151
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,620
Of course not.

152
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,620
This... though I'm not sure if you'll like it.

153
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,150
Oh, my world. Is there a woman anywhere who dislikes flowers?

154
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,600
It smells so good.

155
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,020
How long has it been since I last received a bouquet!

156
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,100
<i>A character like her is my specialty. </i>

157
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,420
<i>It was worth writing daily dramas for a long time.</i>

158
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,730
Your father is on his way back from the airport, returning from a trip with his friends.

159
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,610
- Sit down.<br> - Yes.

160
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,350
<i> My landlord's father is Nam Hee Bong.</i>

161
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,900
<i>After lecturing for 30 years as an ethics teacher,</i>

162
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,100
<i>he retired last year as a principal.</i>

163
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,250
<i>He is a typical educator character. <br> [Respect your teachers, and love your students. <br> — Nam Hee Bong]</i>

164
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,130
<i>This is my area of expertise.</i>

165
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,570
<i>This will be easier than I thought.</i>

166
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,920
<i>You're here?</i>

167
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,650
You said you were a tenant then, so I thought you were just the new tenant.

168
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,060
It's natural to come and go around the house if you're getting married.

169
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,430
You didn't think we would understand that?

170
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,600
Didn't you think like that?

171
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,490
Thank you for understanding.

172
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,910
I wasn't in the right frame of mind last time.

173
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,580
Of course.

174
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,970
That's when it's good if the man speaks up.

175
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,750
The men in our house are rather shy.

176
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:44,650
But those kind of men take good care of you behind the scenes, don't they?

177
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,060
What was it? Tsundere? (Term for a character who is cold on the outside but caring on the inside.)

178
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,130
Right?

179
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,440
- I'm aware since our family is from Gyeongsangdo. <br> - Really?

180
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,530
- Where in Gyeongsangdo?

181
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,230
- Namhae.

182
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,680
- It's great that you went to Seoul National University all the way from Namhae.

183
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,420
It's so difficult to be accepted to a university located in Seoul even if you grew up in Seoul.

184
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,090
Right?

185
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,750
Why are you saying you want to get married?

186
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,190
What do you mean why? The two youths are getting married because they like each other.

187
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,550
Why are you asking such a weird question?

188
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,210
You attended a prestigious school and must have been passionate about your writing.

189
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,300
Why are suddenly talking of marriage? That too after quitting work.

190
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,840
- That—<br> - Please stop.

191
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,770
You pushed Mother to get me married not long ago.

192
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,290
Now, what are you doing?

193
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,180
I didn't ask you.

194
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,900
Yes, th-that is,

195
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,850
I haven't known Se Hee for very long but—

196
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,410
Couples don't call each other that way, do they?

197
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,310
You were born in '88, not '78.

198
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,670
Is that how you address the person you're dating?

199
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,430
Are you conducting a pressure interview?

200
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,540
I am asking reasonable questions.

201
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,110
- Don't overdo it.<br>- Why are you asking things like why we are getting married?

202
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,530
Can't a dad ask even that?

203
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,730
Oppa!

204
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,310
I—l love him.

205
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,530
<i>- Episode 5 - <br>Because This is My First Promise</i>

206
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,150
1:46 pm.

207
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,560
<i>Are you and Ji Ho having a good weekend? I was really touched that day.</i>

208
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,790
<i>You both are so in love!</i>

209
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,430
- Ah, this.<br> <i>- Son,</i>

210
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,630
<i> I love you.</i>

211
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,320
- Are you going to exercise?<br> - Yes.

212
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,360
You are eating a late lunch.

213
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,700
Yes, since I slept late.

214
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,710
I must have released the stress of greeting your family.

215
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,000
You must have been very anxious that day.

216
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,390
Yes, probably.

217
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,030
You would have been tense. How did that—

218
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:38,130
- Yes?<br> <i>- I— l love Oppa.</i>

219
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,650
Did you draw that out of your drama experience?

220
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,030
I am surprised once again by your drastic decision-making skills.

221
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,730
Yes.

222
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,360
Based on your father's type, I thought we needed

223
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,960
a breakthrough.

224
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,020
I see. It was a breakthrough I never even thought of.

225
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,750
I was also surprised it was resolved through you.

226
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,030
He's not the type of person to believe those words though.

227
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:14,990
It occurred to me that your father was waiting for such a declaration.

228
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,080
I think he wanted to verify

229
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,130
if I am a safe person for his son.

230
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,210
Truthfully, it might be a little obvious, but

231
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,460
there is no more definite answer than love in that situation.

232
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,670
Right. There's no easier word than that either.

233
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,000
Now the only thing left is to have both families meet formally.

234
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,200
Then is the entire process wrapping up?

235
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,610
If there is no unexpected change, yes.

236
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,480
I'll be going.

237
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,560
Have a good workout.

238
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,560
<i>- Is everyone busy today? Shall we have dinner together?<br> - Soo Ji: I can't. Working overtime today. <br>- Okay, how about Ho Rang?</i>

239
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,600
It's pretty.

240
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,500
What?

241
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,420
The fine dust.

242
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,790
It sounds crazy, right?

243
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,890
Yep.

244
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,060
More than Ji Ho?

245
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,230
Nope.

246
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,060
<i>Soo Ji, is Ho Rang all right?</i>

247
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,730
What does Ji Ho say? Is she asking if I'm okay?

248
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,560
Yeah.

249
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,630
Did I not look okay when Ji Ho spoke to us?

250
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,960
Was it really obvious I was jealous?

251
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,960
No, just a little obvious.

252
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:29,090
<i>Ji Ho, wear the dress I gave you when the families meet each other tomorrow, understood?</i>

253
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,990
<i>I know this is weird, but</i>

254
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,810
<i>now of all times, especially me getting married...</i>

255
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,690
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

256
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,870
I knew you'd be like this.

257
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,040
<i>That's right, be sorry only until today, okay?</i>

258
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,080
Why is she sorry? It's not like she stole and married my husband.

259
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,030
She's just too softhearted.

260
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,270
You've never seen Brother-in-law, have you?

261
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,860
Who is Brother-in-law?

262
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,390
Ji Ho's groom. You don't know him exactly either, do you?

263
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,450
He's already Brother-in-law?

264
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,080
We need to investigate before they set a date.

265
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,220
Our softhearted girl. I worry that perhaps she's fallen for the wrong person.

266
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,990
Let's ask Won Seok when he comes.

267
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,920
He would know best.

268
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,250
What?

269
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,560
You haven't made up yet?

270
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,070
He hasn't come up for the past five days. Sim Won Seok.

271
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,620
They won't give you a refund?

272
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,510
They said never.

273
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,590
Aren't you going home? I had 23 bottles of soju in 3 days thanks to you.

274
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,870
I feel like my intestines have burst and my liver has partially melted.

275
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,270
There has to be a house for me to go back to. Where is it?

276
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,760
The lease is under your name, but the security deposit is paid by your girlfriend. Go back to that rooftop home.

277
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,700
I won't, I won't go! I'm so mad! Do you know how much effort I put into that sofa?

278
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,250
The wireless keyboard that I love, I even sold that for a cheap price on line.

279
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,360
Then why the heck did she get so angry?

280
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,300
You bought her a sofa when she asked. If that's not the answer, what is?

281
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,420
I don't know. How would I know her fickle mind?

282
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,000
Perhaps, was it not wanting the sofa but something else?

283
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:41,160
He really bought you the sofa. Your Won Seok is

284
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,850
bright and innocent.

285
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,560
But this is actually pretty good.

286
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:56,700
That bright, tiny, pebble-like engineering student.

287
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,050
I thought I shaped him into a mineral, but

288
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,730
I was mistaken. A stone is still a stone.

289
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,690
Then, you ask him to get married first.

290
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,670
- Are you crazy?! <br> - Why not?

291
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,940
The first person who wants to should say it.

292
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,180
I don't want to!

293
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,170
I don't want to seem desperate.

294
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,500
Getting married?

295
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,990
Right! Look here. Sofa, home for the newlywed, the junior at work. Hence,

296
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,550
she wants to have a newlywed home you can put that sofa in, like her work junior. Hence, she wants to get married.

297
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,180
It's right!

298
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,390
Nah. No way.

299
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,040
What's "no way" about it? You guys have been dating for seven years!

300
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,960
Then usually, people get married.

301
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,370
Hyungnim, our Rang isn't that kind of ordinary woman!

302
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,160
When I was writing my thesis, do you know what she was doing? When my professor left for a family vacation,

303
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,980
she would watch their dog, and she even helped their kids with their homework.

304
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,630
A girl like her knows better than anyone else that this is the most important time in my life.

305
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,160
Getting married? Oh, Hyung! It's because you don't know my Rang.

306
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,480
My God. We missed that!

307
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:18,050
The sofa was the display model. That's why!

308
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,700
Daebak! Oh.

309
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,290
Oh, it's that! It was that! Hyung, how did you know that?

310
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,890
Oh, we missed that one!

311
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,500
Seriously.

312
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,680
- This liquor.<br> - Have something to go with it.

313
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,180
It was because the sofa was the display model!

314
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,090
Yeah. Mom, you're not sleeping?

315
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,650
What?

316
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,780
Are you coming up on tomorrow morning's bus?

317
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,440
<i>Yes. </i>

318
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,370
It's nothing else, but I wanted to tell you something about the family meeting.

319
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,400
<i>Oh, Ji Ho? What? </i>

320
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,070
Oh. Dad. What happened to Mom?

321
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,010
<i>I don't know! Your mom put me on the phone.</i>

322
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,720
<i>What? What happened now? </i>

323
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,480
Well, that's . . .

324
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,940
All right, Dad. Come safely. Yes.

325
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,350
- You're here.<br> - Yes.

326
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,930
Was that your father?

327
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,660
Yes. Oh, I told him today that we're not having a wedding ceremony.

328
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,480
I see. I told them today, too.

329
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,320
- Really?<br> - Yes.

330
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,290
I thought I should tell them in advance, so we don't get anything unexpected tomorrow.

331
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,660
How were your parents? Did they accept it well?

332
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,040
Yes. Fortunately,

333
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,520
Dad surprisingly didn't say anything.

334
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,630
I think it's because my brother hasn't had his wedding yet, and that was helpful to us.

335
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,410
I see. My mother didn't have much opinion on it either.

336
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,460
I think it was a shocker to her when I let her know the detailed facts of the cost of a wedding.

337
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,330
I see. That's a relief.

338
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,560
Then...

339
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,410
After this family meeting, we won't have any more expenditures, right?

340
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:27,590
Yes. Then, how about we finish the final contract tomorrow, after we get back from the meeting of the families?

341
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,130
Yes.

342
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,270
But Ji Ho, your mother. What is her thought on it?

343
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,410
- What? <br>- When I think about it,

344
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:45,010
since we went to meet her last time, your mother hasn't had much of an opinion.

345
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,400
M-Mom...

346
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,210
She doesn't usually have opinions.

347
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,290
As I told you, our family is an absolute patriarchy.

348
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:07,570
Oh, now that I think about it, your father didn't say any...

349
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,790
- What about your father's thoughts?<br> - I am not interested.

350
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,480
What?

351
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,920
<i>It's tomorrow at five'o clock. I will be waiting at the terminal.</i>

352
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,680
<i>All right.</i>

353
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,190
<i>The weather in Seoul is cold so dress warmly. </i>

354
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,780
<i>Of course!</i>

355
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,910
<i>Mom, make sure you bring anti-nausea medicine.</i>

356
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,400
How come Mom doesn't even give one reply?

357
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,360
She put dad on the phone, too.

358
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,460
<i>Mom, are you asleep? </i>

359
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,250
<i>I'm sleeping. </i>

360
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,300
How did she text me if she was asleep?

361
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,200
What is it?

362
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,220
This feeling like she's protesting to me?

363
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,740
Getting married is a huge event, isn't it?

364
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,460
This is not just any event, right?

365
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,600
On that, please take a drink from me.

366
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,040
Yes. Of course.

367
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,360
Kids are so smart these days.

368
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,020
At first when they said they weren't going to have a ceremony, it was kind of disappointing.

369
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,830
But if you think about it, it's such a wise thought in today's time of recession, right?

370
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,900
Yes, well, I'm grateful that you think that way.

371
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,000
Take a drink from me too, please.

372
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,220
Yes. Thank you.

373
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,530
To be able to get into Seoul National University from Namhae,

374
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,780
she must have been so smart ever since she was little.

375
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,650
No, just the same as others.

376
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,920
She knows how to be respectful to her elders too, I noticed.

377
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,120
Just the same as others.

378
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,100
She's so gentle and amiable, unlike the kids today.

379
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,430
That's not true.

380
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,640
She's the same as others.

381
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,930
- Oh, I see. <br>- She's just the same.

382
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:25,020
She's adequately immature and adequately selfish like kids today.

383
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,750
She's exactly like how they are today. Nothing different.

384
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,320
I see.

385
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,050
Why are you saying useless things.

386
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,630
So please take a drink from me too, Mrs.

387
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,800
- Yes, shall I? <br>- It's a good day today.

388
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,670
Yes.

389
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,530
You paid?

390
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,840
Yes.

391
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,060
I saw on some blog that it's best to settle the bill from the family meeting in advance.

392
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,080
Should we settle shared expenses like this at the month end?

393
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,030
It might be too much to have to go half and half each and every time.

394
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,560
After today, we won't have reason to anyway.

395
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
I'll just take care of today.

396
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,620
No. This place is expensive.

397
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:23,510
But your parents made the trip all the way to Seoul.

398
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:28,160
We should take into consideration their cost of transportation and the trouble, too.

399
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,960
Yes.

400
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,580
Oh. No.

401
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,730
So we meet, and we let them know,

402
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:54,430
and after we get through a few steps, it's finished.

403
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,970
It's easier than I thought, getting married.

404
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,440
Actually, I was worried, honestly,

405
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,930
that the families might have a hard time understanding.

406
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,840
I expected it would be this easy.

407
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,620
- Really?<br> - Yes.

408
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,650
Since it's quite a good collaboration. We are.

409
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,450
I have a mortgage but that I have a house.

410
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,920
You graduated from an ivy-league school, but you're jobless.

411
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,520
I think these played definitive roles for both families.

412
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,620
I understand the first one, but why the second?

413
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,930
Because socially, they do want someone who would add to their reputation as a family of educators.

414
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:39,140
While personally, they won't want to have a daughter-in-law that they need to look up to.

415
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,420
You somehow met both of my parent's hypocritical demands.

416
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,230
I see.

417
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,670
To think that I am a jobless ivy-league graduate,

418
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:53,460
I never knew it could bring about such a synergy. It's a relief.

419
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,790
I am the grateful one.

420
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,360
What did I say? What did I?

421
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,760
What's wrong with you today?

422
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,760
You drunk?

423
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,190
Sure. I'm a little drunk.

424
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,110
Since I'm a little drunk, I'll say a little what I want to say.

425
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:30,660
We are not interested in just sending our daughter off like this haphazardly.

426
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,610
- What do you mean, haphazardly? <br>- We're going to do what others all do, too.

427
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,630
We'll have to do a ceremony, too.

428
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,840
The kids already settled on it though.

429
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,760
We are the same. There should be a wedding ceremony.

430
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,500
Are you senile?

431
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,940
You sick somewhere?

432
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,770
I guess it's time I got menopause.

433
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,030
What's really wrong with you? You trying to wreck your daughter getting married?

434
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,260
What? What did I do?

435
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,100
They first started talking like that.

436
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,800
Say what? They are so nice.

437
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,200
Saying how she's not like the kids today.

438
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,990
That she's gentle and amiable.

439
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,170
Those are compliments to a woman though.

440
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,250
If they both work, it'll cost more to raise kids.

441
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,830
So she is saying it's good she quit her job to stay home.

442
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,440
That's the truth though.

443
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,240
And the decisive one. How is she like me at all?

444
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,550
Mom, you and Noona look the same.

445
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,630
You didn't know that?

446
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,520
Mom!

447
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,320
What's really wrong?

448
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:29,690
Mom, last time when you went to Young In Unni's wedding, you said it was a noisy and money-wasting event, too.

449
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,570
Mom, it's good enough to have a quiet meeting between the families.

450
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,920
Why does it have to be a wedding exactly?

451
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,440
It's because they seem to think you're a pushover.

452
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,010
You thought gentle and amiable were compliments?

453
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:46,060
That all means you are obedient to the in-laws.

454
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,770
And it's to tell you not to make noise.

455
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:53,930
And not doing a wedding, too. If it's not because they are looking down on you since you're already living with him, then what is it?

456
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,260
Why do you make things so twisted?

457
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,290
It's because it's the truth. The truth!

458
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,090
All right, since we're talking about this, let me ask you.

459
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:08,090
You... Why are you getting married?

460
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,120
What's there to be a "why" about getting married?

461
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,780
I mean, at thirty, is getting married a strange thing?

462
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,320
What about your work?

463
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,500
Your writing?

464
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,630
I don't write anymore.

465
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,140
I ended it.

466
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,470
So then, this is like getting a job.

467
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,340
- Instead of marrying. <br>- So, what? I can't do that?

468
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,180
Do you think I paid for your tuition and let you go to Seoul for this?

469
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,300
Did you insist on being a writer even when your dad gave you a hard time for this?

470
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,430
Just to turn out like this?

471
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,260
So what?

472
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,840
Did you think I would become something big?

473
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:52,730
Did you have hope that I would give you money once I became a famous scriptwriter?

474
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,630
Yes, that's what I wanted, why?

475
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,700
After giving you so much, I feel like it's all such a waste.

476
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,650
I paid for your college admission fee and gave you more money for you to spend in Seoul without your father knowing.

477
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,880
Leave that dress from the department store you wore for the reading here before you go.

478
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,360
If she wants to get married as a job...

479
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,440
You couldn't even get yourself a luxury bag like everyone else. Just look at your stupidity.

480
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,440
You have to have something to get something.

481
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,200
What do we have at home?

482
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,520
You can't even afford your daughter a room.

483
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,510
What would you expect me to get? You should listen to what you're saying!

484
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,520
Writer? To be able to continue that type of thing, you need to come from a rich family background.

485
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:47,200
If you don't have money, then all you can do is sleep.

486
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,710
There's no such thing as dreams.

487
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:16,360
So what you're father is doing is being considerate of her family. Usually, the men don't really care,

488
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,000
but normally, the bride would like to wear a wedding dress and do these types of things.

489
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,120
Your motto in life is to not care about how other people think, isn't it?

490
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,740
Please relay this message to him.

491
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,510
So, the thing is...

492
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:40,380
Se Hee is saying it's pointless to hold an expensive wedding to live up to outsiders' expectations.

493
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,510
My daughter-in-law isn't an outsider.

494
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,310
Tell him I said that.

495
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:54,720
So, your dad feels like a wedding is a happy day welcoming a new member of the family.

496
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,790
Everyone should come together and congratulate each other.

497
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,220
Just say that you feel like you wasted all the money you gave away at weddings.

498
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,880
That sounds much more sincere coming from you.

499
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,810
Se Hee...

500
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:11,270
You just want to brag about how well you raised your son

501
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,310
and how your daughter-in-law graduated from a prestigious university.

502
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,910
I'm not getting married to make you look good.

503
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,940
You promised that once I get married, you will stop threatening Mom with divorce

504
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,890
and stop caring about my business.

505
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,610
Please keep it.

506
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:36,980
How is it considered a marriage without a wedding ceremony? What kind of marriage is that?

507
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,240
I won't accept it.

508
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,010
Hold it in. Hurry and leave.

509
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,240
Go quickly.

510
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,830
Didn't you have a full Korean meal for dinner?

511
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,660
I've digested it all from arguing with my mom.

512
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,440
Are you seriously not going to hold a wedding ceremony?

513
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,760
How can I hold a wedding when I'm unemployed, and

514
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,930
my house owner's finances are tight with a mortgage payment, too. What wedding?

515
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,150
But don't you still want to wear a wedding dress?

516
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,400
Are you not even going to take wedding pictures?

517
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,370
I'm not sure. The house owner and I don't really have many thoughts about that.

518
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:32,240
Ji Ho, you getting married, isn't just for you.

519
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,390
Your opinion doesn't matter.

520
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,210
Then why do you hold press conferences before a drama airs?

521
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:43,150
You do that to draw attention, so the investors and the stations don't lose out. It's the same for weddings, too.

522
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,570
That's why I don't want to.

523
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,330
Why must we? And how are my parents investors?

524
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,130
It's about the same anyway.

525
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,630
You said your mother said the same, too, though she said it out of anger.

526
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,960
It's not only for money, but they want to be compensated emotionally.

527
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,510
Yeah, I also want to see you in a dress. Don't you think your mom would want it more?

528
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,410
I don't have money for the wedding.

529
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,230
Neither the house owner nor I.

530
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,960
However, why have you been addressing your fiancé as "house owner" since earlier?

531
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,640
What?

532
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,710
Did I do that?

533
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,910
Yeah, twice now.

534
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,200
Did I?

535
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,900
Why did I do that?

536
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,140
By any chance, do you guys

537
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:36,160
have some type of role play between house owner and tenant?

538
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,610
"Your rent is overdue."

539
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,880
"I'll teach you a lesson tonight."

540
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,390
I like it, Soo Ji!

541
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,910
No! What are you doing?

542
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,830
"There's only cold water coming out of the shower."

543
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,880
"Then I'll warm it up for you,

544
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,360
with my body!"

545
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,820
Oh my gosh. That's so dirty!

546
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,320
I said that's not it. Are you seriously crazy?

547
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,930
Hey, did you leave without wearing your bra again?

548
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,460
Yeah.

549
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,190
What's wrong with you, seriously?

550
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,700
Why did you go without wearing it?

551
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,290
Hey, think about it. Imagine a perfect size chest like mine being

552
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,140
squeezed like this all day.

553
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,360
Isn't that hard for you?

554
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,810
Let go. I'm going to kill you.

555
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,160
If I didn't have to wear a bra, I would love going to work.

556
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,830
<i>Noona, Mom wants to know your boyfriend's phone number.</i>

557
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,600
Ahjumma, we'll take another 500 ml of beer.

558
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,740
No need!

559
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,580
Didn't you say you wanted to get drunk today?

560
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,340
I am drunk. This is good enough.

561
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,950
Your neurons are so rational to be feeling drunk already with just 500 ml of beer.

562
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:55,460
However, why don't those rational neurons work that well with marriage?

563
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,420
- What are you talking about?<br> - Weddings are used to collect money.

564
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,740
How many times have I told you that it's a strange ritual where people pay for their own meals and still shout with elation?

565
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,260
You only hold a wedding ceremony in order to get money from people. In the end, you are sure to benefit from it.

566
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,640
I have no thought of being my parents' sidekick to collect money.

567
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,330
Because you refused to be the sidekick a single time, do you want to suffer for the rest of your life?

568
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,300
Don't you want to get it over with in one to two hours and then enjoy a comfortable married life?

569
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,140
Are you confident that you can withstand your parents nagging for not having a wedding ceremony for the rest of your life?

570
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,500
Just do it. It doesn't cost that much.

571
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,920
Should I make a cost estimate for you?

572
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,240
- No need.<br> - Okay.

573
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,780
The congratulatory monies you'd receive would cover the meal.

574
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,300
Bride's dress. I know a cheap place.

575
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,290
Traditional wedding, skip.

576
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,780
Here, this is about what it should be.

577
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,820
I said no need.

578
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,920
This is all that it will cost?

579
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,530
And we can get it down more using the acquaintance chance.

580
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,510
Him, for instance.

581
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,730
However, who is that person that's been sleeping here since earlier?

582
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,910
It was not since earlier but since yesterday.

583
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,860
Ah! This is him. The one that introduced you to Ji Ho! Ji Ho's friend.

584
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,860
Hey! Get up! Get up!!

585
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,220
- Aigoo.<br> - Hey, be careful of this.

586
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,630
Nice to meet you.

587
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,050
I'll make the mobile invitation for you. For free.

588
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,080
How did it go with your mother?

589
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,090
What about your father?

590
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,260
- Should we just— <br> - Should we just—

591
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,290
Please speak first.

592
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,630
Should we just...

593
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,390
have a wedding ceremony?

594
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:38,160
This week, please pay special attention to the stabilization of the project. You're all aware that it's an entire company dinner this coming Monday, right?

595
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,340
Who holds a company dinner on Monday? There's a problem with the company culture.

596
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,930
That's the strength of our company that is liberal.

597
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:47,650
If you don't like it, you should become a CEO, okay?

598
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,760
I think I'll have to miss the company dinner this time.

599
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,520
You're aware that you can't miss a company dinner unless there's a death in the family, right, Mr. Nam?

600
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,720
There's a wedding on Monday night.

601
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,350
Ah... a wedding on a Monday night.

602
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,220
It's a great Monday night to get married.

603
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,860
What kind of people get married on a Monday night? Whose wedding is it?

604
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,280
It's my wedding.

605
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,490
So, I must go.

606
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,930
It was cheapest to get married on a Monday night.

607
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:23,910
Ah, you're the emcee, CEO Ma. Can you not be there because of a company dinner?

608
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,230
♫ <i>While thinking of you</i> ♫

609
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,980
She said she wore it once taking photos. It's really almost brand new.

610
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,510
Thanks. Be sure to tell your friend that I'll treat her to dinner.

611
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,450
But someone already wore this dress. Will you be okay?

612
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:47,480
Since it was used for photos, it's too simple. There's no volume.

613
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,820
Gosh... I'm only going to wear it for an hour.

614
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:56,060
It's pretty. And all the wedding dresses look the same to me.

615
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,950
How could that be? Are you color blind?

616
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,050
It's a weekday evening. Are you expecting many guests?

617
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:07,280
Well, most of them are my parents' guests. We don't have many guests. The house owner...

618
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,790
As for Se Hee, his coworkers are the only ones.

619
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:16,180
Is there anyone interesting among the groom's friends? I haven't dated in awhile.

620
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,380
It's not that you haven't dated in awhile. You mean you took a break from your sex life.

621
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:24,690
Hey, that ahjussi you used to stay in touch with. Are you not interested anymore? Did you completely cut off contact?

622
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,770
He looks perfectly fine, but he moves around too much. Gives me a headache.

623
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,200
Oh, yeah, Rang.

624
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,720
I contacted Won Seok because of the wedding.

625
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,060
Ah, really?

626
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,310
Won Seok, I think he drinks every day these days.

627
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,970
His voice sounded really bad.

628
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,790
Really?

629
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,970
You're not going to call him?

630
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,520
Why would I call my ex-boyfriend? So messy.

631
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,730
If he doesn't call for over a week, doesn't that mean he wants to break up with me?

632
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:03,120
I'm going on a blind date next week.

633
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,930
Here.

634
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,200
What kind of concept would you like? Melodrama, romantic comedy, or comedy?

635
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,820
- What's this? <br> - Your wedding concept. Are you going to have a celebratory song?

636
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,210
No.

637
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:27,030
For a wedding, doing a spinning game, squat and stand, or doing push-ups. These traditional concepts are fun.

638
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:31,060
- I'm so looking forward to it. <br> - Don't do anything.

639
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:38,360
What kind of concept would you like? Melodrama, romantic comedy, or comedy?

640
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,260
- What's this? <br> - Your wedding concept.

641
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,450
Are you going to have a celebratory song? No.

642
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:49,220
For a wedding, doing a spinning game, squat and stand, or doing push-ups. These traditional concepts are fun.

643
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,370
- I'm so looking forward to it. <br> - Don't do anything.

644
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,870
There's only one thing you have to do, CEO Ma. End the wedding ceremony as quickly as possible.

645
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:03,230
What are you saying? The wedding ceremony that happens only once in your lifetime, you want to end it like that?

646
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:08,630
Yeah. A wedding ceremony that won't be remembered by anyone. A short and very ordinary wedding ceremony.

647
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,580
I beg of you.

648
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,750
I'm sure he's up to something.

649
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,690
How about the groom's suit?

650
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,530
- I think I'll just wear my suit.<br> - Okay.<br> <i>D-70: Choosing the wedding dress and tuxedo.</i>

651
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,950
As for our parents' Korean dress... My parents say they'll borrow our relatives'.

652
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,990
My mother has one also.

653
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,730
Okay. They're taken care of rather easily.<br> <i>D-70:<br> Ordering Korean dress.</i>

654
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,290
So, I think that's all, right?

655
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,690
There's one most important thing. Our contract.

656
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,600
Ah, yes.

657
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,260
What we need to agree on is...

658
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,030
About the cost of things and...

659
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,270
About ending our contract.

660
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:58,950
Yes, as we discussed previously, we'll spend our own money on holiday or family-related expenses.

661
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,450
Will you be okay with that?

662
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,880
Yes, I'm fine.

663
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,230
We'll say our contract will expire in two years. In the case of a variable in the meantime,

664
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:10,500
- we'll renegotiate. Will that be okay? <br> - Yes.

665
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,030
Ah.

666
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:18,000
But in what form would contract expiration take place?

667
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,530
So, would it be a divorce?

668
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,770
Of course, we won't be registering our marriage, but

669
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:28,320
when we consider how people around will know about us...

670
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,890
Yes, I guess so.

671
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,960
We'll have to announce the end of our contract in the form of a divorce.

672
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,650
On the outside, we can say we settled for a divorce over irreconcilable differences.

673
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:41,020
What do you think about that?

674
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,170
Yes, I think that would be good.

675
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,890
I understand.

676
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,730
What are you bringing me this late?

677
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,700
The side dishes that Mom brought for the family meeting.

678
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,140
She couldn't give them to you because you left like that.

679
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:06,430
Well... Mom says to get your boyfriend's phone number.

680
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:09,570
Tell her you don't know. Say I won't tell you.

681
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,790
What is she going to say to him?

682
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:14,330
What's wrong with Mom all of a sudden anyway?

683
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,410
Why is she being so fussy?

684
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,340
I'm shocked myself.

685
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,920
I didn't think my mom would do that. About the wedding, too.

686
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,510
Especially asking you to get a luxury bag from the groom. That was shocking.

687
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,000
I know.

688
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,630
Don't worry. You just have to have a wedding.

689
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,000
I'll take Mom and Dad home safely. See you at the wedding.

690
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,690
Bye.

691
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,410
Noona.

692
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,220
But...

693
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,930
I think I know a little bit about why Mom is acting like that.

694
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:50,390
Marriage isn't that simple like you're thinking.

695
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,290
I'm sure you'll know what I mean when you get married. Bye.

696
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,130
People would think he's been married for six years.

697
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:03,530
He's only been married six months.

698
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,850
<i>According to the sociologist Gary Becker,</i>

699
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:14,440
<i>there has to be a bigger benefit to getting married than living single</i>

700
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,090
<i>for people to get married.</i>

Yes.

717
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:39,610
It suits you better than I anticipated.

718
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:42,560
Thank you.

719
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:48,630
What? A traffic jam? Then, how long...

720
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,630
<i>There must be an accident. I think it will take longer than an hour. What should we do?</i>

721
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:52,870
An hour?

722
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:56,000
<i>Ji Ho, I think you two should get going first or you'll be late.</i>

723
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,400
Oh, okay. I'll see you later then.

724
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,820
What should we do? I think my friends who are supposed to pick us up are stuck.

725
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:07,730
Yes, I was looking at the traffic condition. I think there's been an accident.

726
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:11,060
I think we should go ahead and take a taxi. If not, we'll be late.

727
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,960
Yes, let's do that.

728
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:21,310
That bus. It goes straight to the front of the wedding hall.

729
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,430
I know.

730
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,710
If we take a taxi it will be pricey.

731
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,000
Shall we run?

732
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,500
Yes.

738
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,900
We should arrive on time, right?

739
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,040
Yes. We have enough time.

740
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:08,810
By chance, do you think you'll need a handkerchief?

741
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:11,030
What? A handkerchief?

742
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:15,240
My friend who's supposed to emcee told me to be sure to bring a handkerchief.

743
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:21,240
When the bride cries, the groom should be sure to wipe her tears.

744
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:24,730
Cry? Me?

745
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:28,400
Right? That won't happen, right?

746
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,100
No.

747
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,710
You worry over so many things.

748
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,050
Why would I cry? I'm not like that.

749
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:43,100
Yes. I'm so glad that you're not.

750
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:49,760
- Hi, Ji Ho. <br> - You're so pretty.

751
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,560
- Ji Ho! <br> - Ji Ho!

752
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,730
Oh, my goodness! You're so pretty!

753
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:58,180
I did expect it, but you make even my heart skip a beat.

754
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,920
Friends, please sit. I'll take a photo.

755
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,860
Yes.

756
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,300
Hey, your groom is a ton better looking in person than in the photo.

757
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,750
What the? You said you don't care about looks.

758
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,550
Yeah! It was a total shock. He's tall, too.

759
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:15,280
Really? He's tall?

760
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,210
Hey, did you do your makeup waterproof?

761
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,640
Waterproof?

762
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,190
Hey, your makeup will get erased when you cry later. That's why you're supposed to do bridal makeup in waterproof. You didn't know?

763
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,230
I'm taking it.

764
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,450
One, two.

765
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,480
Hello.

766
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,160
Congratulations.

767
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,620
Please go in.

768
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,320
Where are you going?

769
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,010
Restroom.

770
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:12,280
The bride went to the restroom though.

771
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,500
She did?

772
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:36,260
You needed to see me for something?

773
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,780
Nothing.

774
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,730
Why would I need to?

775
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,640
But why are you coming out of there?

776
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,900
I thought it was the restroom, so I went in there.

777
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,050
Mom.

778
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:58,740
That person. Why did you ask for his phone number?

779
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:05,910
What? I can't ask for my son-in-law-to-be's phone number?

780
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,740
To say what to him now?

781
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,710
What?

782
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:15,550
Mom, we're doing this wedding like you wanted,

783
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:18,780
so don't say anything sour anymore.

784
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,430
If you say strange things to him again,

785
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:25,010
then I will really be mad.

786
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,320
Okay?

787
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,760
You should also

788
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,840
have a daughter just like you and raise her.

789
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:53,890
The ceremony will start very soon.

790
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,460
Yes.

791
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,410
Oh. That black bag is Se Hee's bag, right?

792
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,610
Yes, it is. Why?

793
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,250
Earlier, your mother asked about it, saying she had something to give him.

794
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,850
What? My mom?

795
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,660
Yes. She put something in the bag and left.

796
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,010
I just knew it.

797
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,620
What is this?

798
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:29,680
We are about to commence the wedding ceremony of groom, Mr. Nam Se Hee and bride, Miss Yoon Ji Ho.

799
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,760
May all the guests be seated now.

800
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,620
Se Hee.

801
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,160
What?

802
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,610
Se Hee.

803
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,350
What? Why?

804
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:07,400
How would I know?

805
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,090
Um...

806
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,340
Ji Ho.

807
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:36,480
<i>I'm Ji Ho's mom. </i>

808
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,360
<i>I'm not sure how I should address you yet. </i>

809
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,630
<i>Since I've only seen you a few times.</i>

810
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:46,980
<i>At the meeting of the family, I'm sorry about that.</i>

811
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:51,340
<i>It's like that about the oldest daughter.</i>

812
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,680
<i>At times she's like my husband. </i>

813
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,840
<i>And at times she seems like a friend, too. </i>

814
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:09,700
<i>Being discunted by her dad and slighted by her younger brother.</i>

815
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:17,760
<i>Having been born to a foolish mother, she's had to suffer many heartaches, my daughter. </i>

816
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:25,660
<i>But still, fortunately, she did not take after me and she's smart. </i>

817
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,530
<i>Certificate of Merit</i>

818
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,980
<i>At least she won't live like her mom.</i>

819
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,650
<i>I had thought it was fortunately so. </i>

820
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:49,750
<i>But in this day and age, no matter what, you need to be born to good parents. </i>

821
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:54,670
<i>I guess it's all useless even if you're just smart all by yourself.</i>

822
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,350
<i>Se Hee.</i>

823
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:07,180
<i>If I made just two requests from you. </i>

824
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,170
<i>Would it be all right? </i>

825
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:16,890
<i>Ji Ho, if later on, she wants to write,<br> [Assistant Writer: Yoon Ji Ho]</i>

826
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:20,800
<i>could you make it so that she can write? <br> [Assistant Writer: Yoon Ji Ho]</i>

827
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,230
<i>I'll come and help with whatever house chores you have. </i>

828
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,910
<i>Therefore...</i>

829
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:31,340
<i>Even if it's later on, so that she can write again, </i>

830
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:35,470
<i>not giving up on her dream,</i>

831
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:41,860
<i>not living like her mom. Please help her with that.</i>

832
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,910
<i>And also...</i>

833
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:50,710
<i>My Ji Ho, once she starts to cry, she can't stop easily.</i>

834
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,370
<i>So...</i>

835
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:57,060
<i>Please don't let her cry alone.</i>

836
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:03,360
<i>Even if you make her cry, please stay by her side no matter what.</i>

837
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:07,770
Se Hee. They said it's time for the groom to enter. What do we do?

838
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:12,930
Go.

839
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:19,450
I'll figure it out and go in.

840
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:21,480
So you go first.

841
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,820
Yes, Se Hee. I'll take care of the bride well.

842
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,470
You go first now. The guests are waiting.

843
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:29,210
Hurry.

844
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,690
Tissue.

845
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:37,750
Make up. Tissue.

846
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,640
Stop it already, Ji Ho.
