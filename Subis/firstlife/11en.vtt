11
45

That's not for me to figure out.

12
49

I'll text you the time and place.

Oh.

19
77
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,050
Yes.

20
81
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,430
You're going out already?

21
85
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,940
Yes.

22
89
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,270
I've agreed to meet Bok Nam for breakfast. Together at the cafe.

23
93
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,480
I see.

24
97
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,420
Oh.

25
101
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,210
Our monthly rental agreement.

26
105
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,860
No.

27
109
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,540
Our monthly rental marriage contract. I am taking mine with me.

28
113
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,450
The other day your mother opened all the drawers here and there and everywhere.

29
117
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,740
So I was going to keep mine at the cafe. It seems safer there.

30
121
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,360
Oh. She won't be coming anymore. I made it clear to her and I changed the passcode, too.

31
125
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,520
Yes. Conversations between mother and son aren't my business.

32
129
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,250
Just in case, I think it's best for you to leave yours at the company too, Landlord.

33
133
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,560
The contract, should it be seen by others, would be troublesome.

34
137
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,540
Yes.

35
141
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,970
Then...

36
145
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,940
Good job, Yoon Ji Ho. It was perfect.

37
149
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,950
I was completely emotionless.

38
153
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,350
Poker face.

39
157
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,140
She's properly pissed off. Right?

40
161
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,650
Huh?

41
165
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,860
Oh, why are you in there now?

42
169
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,700
Let's go out.

43
173
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,120
They are attacking us negatively outright.

44
177
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,560
They seemed to be playing off our "dating, not marriage" name.
 <i>New App Name: Never Mind Dating, Let's Marry</i>

45
182
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,550
The issue is that it's working.

46
186
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,050
They're rated higher than us in the app store already. Barely a month after they launched.

47
190
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,860
So I saw that app,

48
194
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,140
and it even includes one's parent's jobs and yearly salaries.

49
198
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,840
That's working for the unexpectedly traditional children-conscious clientele.

50
202
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,190
Those who date with marriage in mind want a definitive relationship.

51
206
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,710
Chief Nam, what's your thought on this, regarding this urgent crisis?

52
210
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,190
The design concept

53
214
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,880
is excellent.

54
218
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,330
But if they had put that event banner on the bottom of the profile, it would've been much better.

55
222
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,850
Chief Nam?

56
226
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,600
We're not asking you to talk about your impression as a designer here.

57
230
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,360
Maybe it's time we also changed our main concept?

58
234
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,720
The premise of saying that the dating market and the marriage market are separate is in itself rather risky.

59
238
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,580
Uh-huh.

60
242
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,600
I think the app was named wrongly from the get-go. "Dating, not marriage?"

61
246
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,170
Who named this app?

62
250
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,810
The one who did that is the only one here who is married.

63
254
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,970
Then, let's continue the concept meeting tomorrow.

64
258
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,400
Whether we should continue to go with the current concept of dating only,

65
262
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,890
or if we should switch to a concept that includes marriage.

66
266
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,240
Let's meet again tomorrow after everyone has thought about it some more. Ok?

67
270
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,350
Yes.

68
274
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,070
<i>Why did you come today? Then you should've refused after an appropriate amount of time.</i>

69
278
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,040
<i>Or said you had work. </i>

70
282
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,020
<i>Why, when you're someone who usually defends well?</i>

71
286
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,910
<i>Ji Ho, though this wasn't in our contract,</i>

72
290
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,760
<i>for today's unjustified labor you had to do,</i>

73
294
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,830
<i>I hope this can cover it.</i>

74
298
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,060
Ha!

75
302
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,390
Is he Won Bin? What's with "how much will do?" 
(Reference to drama, "Autumn's Tale.")

76
307
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,840
Did something happen with the landlord?

77
311
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,540
Hey, when did you...?

78
315
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,060
I read it, and it sounds pretty good. I think I should do a contract marriage too, later on.

79
319
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,980
You've got a house and you've got a motorcycle. Why would you?

80
323
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,670
Having a house and car is still completely different than having a person.

81
327
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,590
I feel lonely to be home alone nowadays.

82
331
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,640
You are at least less lonely since your husband is at home with you.

83
335
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,130
Hey, do you know why a husband is called 'nam-pyeon'?

84
339
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,250
It's because it means Nam (other's) Pyeon (side) that it's 'nampyeon'. There's an old saying, that goes like this:

85
343
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,580
"The porridge bowls, you have your daughter wash them."

86
347
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,020
"But you have your daughter-in-law wash the dishes that were used for mixing." (give daughter-in-law the more difficult task) Ha! Daughter-like daughter-in-law?

87
351
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,310
If that's what she wanted, then she should make me her foster daughter. Why did she take me as her daughter-in-law?

88
355
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,490
What's wrong?

89
359
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,190
Noona. You resemble someone I know so much right now.

90
363
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,360
Who?

91
367
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,870
My next-door ahjumma.

92
371
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,520
What?

93
375
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,960
That ahjumma, every day . . .

94
379
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,290
she speaks ill of her husband with that exact face.

95
383
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,900
How can your expression be exactly the same as hers?

96
387
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,880
You were so innocent when you first came to work here. But who would've thought I would end up seeing the ahjumma's face on you.

97
391
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,310
I think I'm just not going to get married.

98
395
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,880
I mean, the setup was wrong from the get-go.

99
399
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,490
Dating and not marriage? Even the name is so unaffectionate. It's too pessimistic.

100
403
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,910
- Yeah, that's true.
 - I always thought that.

101
408
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,750
I said that before, too.

102
412
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,950
So, now,

103
416
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,590
I think it's right for our app to go with the concept of putting marriage front and center.

104
420
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,160
Yeah.

105
424
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,040
That's a good idea.

106
428
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,810
Everyone. Look at this.

107
432
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,610
Amidst this crisis, on a weekday, someone's applied for a day off.

108
436
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,890
Shall we try to guess who that was?

109
440
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,970
Not me.

110
444
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,390
Application for day off. Department? Design team.

111
448
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,520
Name? Nam Se Hee.

112
452
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,540
So it's Chief Nam.

113
456
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,800
I've got a personal reason. Inevitably, on a weekday.

114
460
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,370
Which company employee would have such personal, inevitable reason, on a weekday?

115
464
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,300
Kimjang. I need to go and do that.

116
468
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,490
Kimjang? (annual kimchi making ritual)

117
472
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,070
What's kimjang? Is it a newly developed program?

118
476
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,730
Do you mean kimjang as in making kimchi?

119
480
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,660
Yes. <i>That</i> kimjang.

120
484
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,040
How far are you going to make kimchi that you need a day off?

121
488
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,940
Namhae. My wife's home.

122
492
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,310
No, my in-laws' home. I need to go and make kimchi there.

123
496
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,520
I've never applied for a day off this year.

124
500
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,780
I request your speedy approval.

125
504
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,190
Our app name, I think it's best to leave it Dating, not Marriage, after all.

126
508
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,880
Yeah.

127
512
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,530
The name is just fine as is.

128
516
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,310
Yeah. Marriage sucks.

129
520
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,070
Getting married is something that scary. Won Seok-nim.

130
524
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:44,160
<i>Episode 11

131
529
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,270
Oh, Manager, you're on that app too? Gyeolmalrae?

132
533
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,160
No, my boyfriend works at this company, so I just installed it.

133
537
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,940
Really?

134
541
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,400
Oh. You got so many hearts.

135
545
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,520
Well, I'm on it just for fun anyway.

136
549
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,210
It's true. You'll be a married woman soon anyway.

137
553
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,880
Did you two set a date yet?

138
557
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,800
Huh?

139
561
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,380
We're still discussing that.

140
565
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,550
You guys all checked today's lunch reservations?

141
569
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,790
Yes.

142
573
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,520
Hello?

143
577
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,220
Yes, Mother.

144
581
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,690
Yes. Oh, you're here in Seoul?

145
585
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,000
What?

146
589
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,220
Right in front of my company? Yes, I'll come out now.

147
593
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,420
You should have dinner with Rang and I before you leave.

148
597
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,340
I need to go home and make dinner for her father. I've got some time before the bus leaves,

149
601
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,370
so I thought I'd come and look at my son-in-law's face instead of my daughter's.

150
605
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,690
Son-in-law?

151
609
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,770
I saw the picture and the rock on the ring is so big.

152
613
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,460
I think you overdid it?

153
617
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,440
No. I should get at least that much for Rang.

154
621
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,320
That's right.

155
625
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,470
She's my daughter, so I can say this.

156
629
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,390
These days, you can't find a girl like my Ho Rang.

157
633
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:35,240
Once you marry her, she's someone who'd manage your household and be a supportive wife to you. She learned it since she was little from watching me.

158
637
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,390
I know that.

159
641
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,460
Then . . .

160
645
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,880
About when do you plan to have the wedding?

161
649
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,740
What did your parents say?

162
653
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,440
That. Mother, I haven't told my family yet.

163
657
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,580
You should hurry and tell them. It's not so good to drag it out.

164
661
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,460
Rang, too. She can't live with Soo Ji in that apartment forever.

165
665
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,450
Right. Of course.

166
669
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,360
Seok, are you still living in that rooftop room?

167
673
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,550
Yes, I'm still staying there.

168
677
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,520
Does that place even have hot water? Is it wind-proof?

169
681
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,140
Yes, of course. It all works well.

170
685
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,160
<i>Sim Wok Seok and Yang Ho Rang's bankbook</i>

171
689
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:37,140
<i>Rang, what do you mean getting married in a year or two? How can we marry in a year or two?</i>

172
693
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,810
Why can't we get married in a year or two? We've saved up all this money, all this time.

173
697
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,550
I mean, the two of us saved up for two years at $500 each, every paycheck.

174
701
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,460
So that's $1,000 times 24 months. It's no less than . . .

175
705
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,060
<i>Please take your bankbook.</i>

176
709
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,750
It's no less than a lot!

177
713
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,390
Where did I take it off?

178
717
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,760
Maybe I didn't put one on at home at all?

179
721
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,750
Yes, Deputy Park.

180
725
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,040
<i>Deputy Woo, what's taking so long? The food's coming out.</i>

181
729
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,230
Yes, I'm coming.

182
733
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,830
I'll just leave on my coat.

183
737
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,190
This is good.

184
741
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,350
Eat a lot.

185
745
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,370
I'm sweating.

186
749
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,240
It's hot.

187
753
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,850
Deputy Woo, aren't you hot? You should take that off when you eat.

188
757
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,240
I'm alright.

189
761
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,760
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

190
765
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,760
It spilled. Wet wipe.

191
769
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,690
Give it to me. I'll wipe it.

192
773
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,980
I'm sorry. It was slippery.

193
777
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,250
I told you. She doesn't wear one. I told you so.

194
781
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,010
Give it. Give it. $50 each. Give it.

195
785
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,990
But how can she go around without a bra? Is that common for women these days?

196
789
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,850
She should be about a B cup, right?

197
793
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,830
B? B? No, no, no. A very full A.

198
797
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,760
- A very full A.
 - How do you know that?

199
802
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:57,330
You just look and you know. I'm very accurate.

200
806
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,560
Seriously, if I just wasn't married,

201
810
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,550
Deputy Woo and I, together, huh!

202
814
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,620
I would . . .

203
818
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,060
Deputy Woo.

204
822
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,980
How long have you been there?

205
826
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,800
Can you give me a light?

206
830
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,880
So you do smoke.

207
834
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,170
Did you win a lot?

208
838
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,290
Your betting on me being a no-bra.

209
842
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,760
I'm a very full A cup, as you can see, so it was pretty obvious, huh?

210
846
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,700
Deputy Park, I think you're the same size as me.

211
850
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,610
Let me know if you don't plan to shed some weight by working out. I'll lend you mine.

212
854
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,120
Put that away. That gaze that doesn't reveal your intention.

213
858
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,000
You know I dislike that.

214
862
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,520
What exactly happens when you marry?

215
866
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,940
Your impenetrable IT world,

216
870
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,710
how did kimjang and aday-off penetrate it? Through what route?

217
874
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,320
Well, it's something that could be expected.

218
878
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,790
"Seaworld" (in-law-world) started and I plan to pay that back the same way with labor.

219
882
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,460
She was summoned to my family's memorial service. Ji Ho was.

220
886
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,720
I got it. You know Byeong Moon, right?  Eom Byeong Moon?

221
890
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,020
After the Thanksgiving holiday, he needs to take care of his wife for a month like a slave.

222
894
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,750
Why? Because she says she doesn't even want to even look at anyone with the last name Eom.

223
898
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,030
So if he gets kicked out, then he will lie on the sofa in the living room.

224
902
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,810
Then, when his parents show up, he'll go, "Ehem," and put on the 'head of the household' act again.

225
906
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,330
I really don't know what that is.

226
910
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,230
That's nothing other than the social disease created by Korean parents.

227
914
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,190
Inflict physical labor upon other people's kids with 'family' as their pretext.

228
918
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,400
And also demand psychological labor, then in return, have that all come back to them as their children's spousal fights, then divorce.

229
922
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,260
For a rational-thinking human being

230
926
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,330
it's a system that they would never choose. That is marriage.

231
930
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,420
So, never...

232
934
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:29,140
But how come someone like you chose that system?

233
938
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,360
It's really very shocking, isn't it?

234
942
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,990
A left-brain-loan and right-brain-cat guy like you. Why would you choose such an irrational system?

235
946
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,160
I mean, is your wife the cat's butler? Or are you getting rent from your wife, maybe?

236
950
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,700
I mean, it's very questionable.

237
954
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,430
She's pretty.

238
958
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,690
No matter how pretty she is, still . . .

239
962
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,150
Did you forget? She's pretty, I said.

240
966
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,550
A man is an animal with what weakness?

241
970
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,020
- Sight?
 - So if a pretty woman is in front of him,

242
975
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,450
- does he look at her or not? 
- He does.

243
980
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,650
Then, if that man can see that pretty woman every day, does he marry or not marry?

244
984
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,120
He marries no matter what.

245
988
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,500
That's right. So you understand it.

246
992
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,870
<i>I'm at Oppa's company's side entrance parking lot. Run here within twenty minutes.</i>

247
996
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,490
<i>I really need to work off my frustration today, so be prepared.</i>

248
1000
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,800
- Hey, you go in first. I'll see you tomorrow. 
- CEO Ma, you said you had an important meeting today.

249
1005
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,330
An even more important meeting came up. Is that the side entrance?

250
1009
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,220
No. The side entrance is this way.

251
1013
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,620
See you later.

252
1017
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,820
Oh, sorry. I'm so busy, though.

253
1021
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,880
Sorry. See you tomorrow. See you later.

254
1025
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,130
Ta-da. Hello, my baby.

255
1029
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,460
I got it. I got it, so let's eat first before we go on our date.

256
1033
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,760
I told you. I need to work off my frustration today.

257
1037
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,900
What?

258
1041
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,430
Something must have happened at work today.

259
1045
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,620
Nope. What happened?

260
1049
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,610
What? Nothing happened. For real.

261
1053
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,570
Tell me. I mean, please tell me. Something happened, right?

262
1057
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,270
Just something irritating happened.

263
1061
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,970
The male employees made bets on me.

264
1065
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,420
- What kind of a bet? 
- They bet on whether I'm no-bra or not. For $50.

265
1070
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,070
What?

266
1074
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,000
Those bastards.

267
1078
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,290
Forget it. I already threw them a punch.

268
1082
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:10,320
- How? 
- I threw the my cigarette butt in that bastard Deputy Park's coffee cup, like this.

269
1087
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,650
Oh, those bastards are making me crazy.

270
1091
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,660
I will seriously earn lots of money and buy your company, so those employee bastards,

271
1095
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,430
I'll enslave them for my entire life.

272
1099
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:27,070
Those punks. Is that something to bet on? How can they take a person so lightly?

273
1103
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,770
I mean, what woman goes to her work in a no-bra state?

274
1107
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,890
Me.

275
1111
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,330
- What?
 - Me. I am no-bra today.

276
1116
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,760
Really?

277
1120
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,760
Yeah, what?

278
1124
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,730
I'm on my way home already!

279
1128
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,600
Did you eat dinner?

280
1132
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,500
Would I have eaten? At this hour?

281
1136
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,530
No. I'll eat at home.

282
1140
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:29,000
I haven't either. Should we eat something out together?

283
1144
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,360
What? Eat out?

284
1148
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,290
Why eat out, when we're both tight on funds?

285
1152
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:42,010
- I'll just eat at home . . .
- Just take out what's in the fridge and stuff yourself!

286
1157
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,080
He should think about what he does before he suggests eating out!

287
1161
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,560
Oh, he's not a husband, he's my mortal enemy.

288
1165
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,230
Oh, why did I get married?

289
1169
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,790
<i>Noona, you resemble someone I know a lot right now.</i>

290
1173
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,900
<i>- Who? 
- My next door ahjumma. She is always speaking ill of her husband with that exact face.</i>

291
1178
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,460
<i>How come even the expression is the same?</i>

292
1182
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,210
What? "Isn't it enough that I earn money for you?

293
1186
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,970
That paltry little supplement to our living costs?

294
1190
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,390
But he acts like a big shot about it all year long. Ah, he disgusts me.

295
1194
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,170
Aigoo, he makes my skin crawl.

296
1198
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,800
Oh. I took tomorrow off work.

297
1202
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,890
Oh. Did you?

298
1206
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:00,490
Yes. If you let me know the Namhae home address, I'll get there in time for kimchi making.

299
1210
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,070
Yes. I'll send it to you. The address.

300
1214
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,890
Oh, but I can't go tomorrow.

301
1218
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:18,290
Yes, I know. You need to work at the cafe.

302
1222
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:26,120
You went to my family's memorial rite alone so I should go to your family's kimchi-making alone too.

303
1226
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,000
Six hours of labor. I'll fulfill the same time that you put in, and return home.

304
1230
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,030
Oh. That contract. Did you take it and store it at work?

305
1234
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,430
Oh. No. I will keep it in my bag.

306
1238
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,740
CEO Ma tends to dig through my paperwork in the desk sometimes.

307
1242
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,520
So it's safer this way, I think.

308
1246
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,210
I see. Yes, we can't have CEO Ma know. That'll be bad.

309
1250
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,570
Right. We can't.

310
1254
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,730
Then, Soo Ji will know too.

311
1258
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,850
What?

312
1262
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,780
Did you not know?

313
1266
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,770
That CEO Ma and Soo Ji are dating?

314
1270
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,410
They're dating? I mean, how did CEO Ma and Soo Ji end up together?

315
1274
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:17,710
That's what I mean. Human beings are really fascinating.

316
1278
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:22,580
They do not suit each other at all. How can they be dating?

317
1282
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,960
<i>What is he saying?</i>

318
1286
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,610
<i>We even got married.</i>

319
1290
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,770
No-bra? My girlfriend is a no-bra?

320
1294
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,310
Other people would see them.

321
1298
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,960
You think others don't know, right? But, when they look, they know right away.

322
1302
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,780
If they look, it's their fault. Is it my fault?

323
1306
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,050
The one who did the looking is the one at fault. Very bad! But!

324
1310
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:11,430
Tell me honestly. Has this happened before when you went to work, too?

325
1314
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,260
Yeah, a few times.

326
1318
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,140
When I'm working away from the office, I take my bra off and there are times when I forgot to put it back on.

327
1322
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,160
My God!

328
1326
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,340
You're crazy!

329
1330
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,920
If I were crazy I'd go around completely naked.

330
1334
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,060
You can't help but talk back on everything!

331
1338
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,770
I'm telling you to understand me! I don't like it! I don't!

332
1342
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,210
Why are you this angry?

333
1346
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,870
Woo Soo Ji, you don't hear the voice of my heart right now?

334
1350
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,420
This honest heart that loves and worries for his girlfriend?

335
1354
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,970
Not sure. It sounds to my ears like you're trying to wrap your own possessiveness as affection

336
1358
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,010
to rationalize your behavior. Why is that?

337
1362
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:57,320
Why? Why is this sounding like that to you?

338
1366
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,570
This is different from what the contract said. Why are you intervening in my personal life?

339
1370
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,470
Oh, you did well mentioning it. You know what you wrote in the contract, right?

340
1374
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,980
Look. Is this personal life? Huh?

341
1378
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,230
What's this contract? It's weird.

342
1382
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,570
So now, where did you get that bad habit of trying to dodge out of it, huh?

343
1386
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,270
Look here. Our two year term of tenancy marriage contract.

344
1390
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,090
This, what is this?

345
1394
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,330
What is this?

346
1398
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,970
<i> Dating Contract</i>

347
1402
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,690
Ji Ho. Oh.

348
1406
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,370
You should look at this.

349
1410
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,120
What is this? Dating contract?

350
1414
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,710
Yes. It seems to be a dating contract between CEO Ma and Soo Ji.

351
1418
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,090
What did I say? They're not a good match for each other.

352
1422
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,130
And, look here.

353
1426
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,030
Soo Ji is the owner, and CEO Ma is the contractor.

354
1430
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,440
Oh, so it's true. Wow, this girl...

355
1434
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,730
Why would anyone write a contract for dating?

356
1438
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,190
I guess we're not in the position to comment on this, though.

357
1442
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,050
But how did you end up getting this?

358
1446
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,470
Oh, I bumped into CEO Ma earlier.

359
1450
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,520
Our things got mixed up. So, I ended up bringing this.

360
1454
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,220
Oh, they got mixed up.

361
1458
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,430
It's not as if this was switched with our contract, though, right?

362
1462
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,800
Yes, they did.

<i>Two Year Tenancy Marriage Contract</i>

365
1474
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,300

366

 - A part-time job? Why?</i>

Yoon Ji Ho, that nutcase!

371
1499
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,030
What did you want to give me this late at night?

372
1503
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,010
Last time, the marinated crab my mom sent.

373
1507
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:11,320
She gave me this to share with others. I haven't given you yours yet.

374
1511
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,720
Thanks. I better get in touch with your mom. She's doing well, right?

375
1515
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,660
- Yeah, of course. 
 - She's not feeling unwell?

376
1520
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,460
No, she's fine.

377
1524
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,430
- She knows you married for housing, too? 
 - Yeah, of...

378
1529
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,810
The monthly rent is ₩250,000.

379
1533
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,590
Hey, you can't find a room that cheap these days.

380
1537
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,100
Soo Ji, that...

381
1541
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:39,120
Two years later, if you're okay with it, can I go in next, as your husband's next bride?

382
1545
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,620
- Hey! 
 - What?

383
1550
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,220
You're the one who did it.

384
1554
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,110
Aiyoo, crazy girl.

385
1558
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,470
You crazy punk.

386
1562
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,130
Still. No matter what the case, how? Marriage?

387
1566
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,560
Well, human beings have various ways

388
1570
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,290
of living their lives.

389
1574
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,900
But how, for a home? For rent, of all things?

390
1578
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,760
For a home, you say?

391
1582
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:24,410
For such a mere thing as rent? But that "home" is so important.

392
1586
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,230
"Money"... can be such a scary thing.

393
1590
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,790
To me, it was just a spare room that I had.

394
1594
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,960
But to her, it was a room that she really needed. A desperate space.

395
1598
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,460
So I just shared it using a suitable system.

396
1602
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,930
Well, I also needed the money.

397
1606
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,300
When you saw Ji Ho,

398
1610
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,110
you thought of <i>her</i>?

399
1614
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:28,690
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you that it was a fake marriage.

400
1618
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,930
Of course, you wouldn't be able to tell me. How could you tell anyone?

401
1622
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:36,200
And why are you sorry to me?

402
1626
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,540
You're the one who has it tough.

403
1630
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,930
Are you really okay?

404
1634
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:51,800
Yeah. This is what I chose.

405
1638
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,460
For me, it always take me a while to make the decision,

406
1642
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,000
but once I choose, you know I don't usually regret it.

407
1646
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,570
But it doesn't seem like simple business.

408
1650
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,660
This marriage, to you I feel it's not just some work transaction.

00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,360
<i>Deposit records (Yang Ho Rang made most of the deposits)</i>

448
1811
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,840
I finally feel at ease.

449
1815
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,380
Even now isn't too soon if you want to have kids and raise them.

450
1819
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,600
So you can't make our Ho Rang suffer, okay?

451
1823
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,730
Yes, Mother.

452
1827
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:26,230
Your present for getting a job. Work hard and for a long time at the company.

453
1831
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:31,270
Don't ever think about developing something by yourself again. Okay?

454
1835
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,930
Yes. Thank you for this.

455
1839
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,800
Alright.

456
1843
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,940
<i>If there's a place where emotions start,</i>

457
1847
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,460
<i>then clearly somewhere</i>

458
1851
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:11,930
<i>there must be a place for them to meet.</i>

459
1855
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,380
Rang, are you asleep?

460
1859
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,800
You came? You're late.

461
1863
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,630
You smell like soju.

462
1867
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,670
I drank a little.

463
1871
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:46,680
Rang, should we go on a date this weekend?

464
1875
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Date?

465
1879
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,420
Yep, a date.

466
1883
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,660
It's been a while since we've gone out, eaten delicious food,

467
1887
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,370
and watched a movie.

468
1891
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,150
Didn't you say there was a play that you wanted to see?

469
1895
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,620
I'll reserve the tickets.

470
1899
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,510
Okay. Let's do that.

471
1903
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,510
Okay. Let's do that.

472
1907
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:36,940
<i>At the place where our hearts meet</i>

473
1911
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:44,690
<i>will it be possible to start on another path?</i>

474
1915
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,750
<i>But the thing I'm most afraid of</i>

475
1919
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,720
<i>isn't that your path and mine are different</i>

476
1923
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,710
<i>or that our paths will never meet.</i>

477
1927
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,610
<i>It's that to your heart</i>

478
1931
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:11,040
<i>I spoke with CEO Ma. I'll sleep first.</i>

479
1935
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,900
<i>there is no path at all.</i>

480
1939
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:19,100
<i>There might not be a way to your heart</i>

481
1943
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,720
<i>in the first place. That's what I'm afraid of.</i>

482
1947
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,220
<i>I received the address.</i>

483
1951
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,320
<i>I will go make kimchi and return.</i>

484
1955
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,680
<i>But for now,</i>

485
1959
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,280
<i>I can't do anything about it.</i>

486
1963
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,940
<i>Even if I don't know the path to his heart,</i>

487
1967
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:47,220
<i>he knows the path to go make kimchi. And this man...</i>

488
1971
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:54,390
♫ <i>please be a shelter for my tired soul</i> ♫

489
1975
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:58,550
<i>I've ended up liking him.</i>

490
1979
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,310
<i>For now,</i>

491
1983
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,330
<i>that is enough.</i>

492
1987
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,560
♫ <i>give it a quick glance as you pass by</i> ♫

493
1991
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,660
Oh, is that all? On kimchi-making day, will just a few bottles of rice wine be enough?

494
1995
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,990
You need to buy a big barrel of it. Yes!

495
1999
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,560
Okay, got it.

496
2003
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,050
Ji Seok will be here with his wife soon.

497
2007
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:28,740
Is making kimchi some national event? How can you tell your pregnant daughter-in-law to come?

498
2011
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,450
When did Ji Ho say she will be here?

499
2015
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,100
When would Ji Ho have the time to be doing this?

500
2019
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,630
She's busy trying to make a living in Seoul.

501
2023
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,500
She's a stay-at-home wife, why would she be busy?

502
2027
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,550
And shouldn't she learn how to make kimchi since she is married?

503
2031
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,360
Really! Well...

504
2035
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,380
Ji Ho, what's going on?

505
2039
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,790
Oh, you're coming?

506
2043
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,830
<i>Yeah, he's coming in a bit to help you.</i>

507
2047
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,420
How can you come here during a weekday?

508
2051
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,990
<i>No, I can't go. Wait, and he'll arrive soon.</i>

509
2055
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,260
Who are you saying is coming here?

510
2059
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,420
It's cold, close the window!

511
2063
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:38,310
♫ <i>La la la. While thinking of you</i> ♫

512
2067
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:48,040
♫ <i>La la la. I smile quietly.</i> ♫

513

515
2080
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,540

516
2084
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:04,170
♫ <i>Unknown to anyone, I, unknown to anyone</i> ♫

517
2088
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,230
Goodness, you sure have big hands (prepare or give out large amounts of food).

518
2092
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,990
Why did you buy 100 heads of cabbage, anyway? You don't even have enough workers to go through it all!

519
2096
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,960
Oh, don't worry.

520
2100
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,580
It'll be done by the time your husbands come by to eat pork wraps.

521
2104
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,050
But did Ji Ho say she's not coming?

522
2108
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,780
- Ji Ho? 
 - Yes.

523
2113
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,550
Right,

524
2117
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:27,630
she said someone else was coming instead.
 - Who?

525
2122
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:33,110
- Excuse...
 - I don't know, she told me to wait.

526
2127
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:39,880
Excuse me! Hello.

527
2131
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,900
Oh, Se Hee?

528
2135
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,520
How come you're here, Son-in-law Nam?

529
2139
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,350
- Yes. 
<i>- He's Ji Ho's husband!</i>

530
2144
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,330
- He's good-looking.
  - Very good-looking.

531
2149
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,990
He looks fine.

532
2153
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,060
- Maybe he should be <i>your</i> groom.
 - Sounds good to me!

533
2158
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,270
Gosh, just work already.

534
2162
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,060
<i>The neighborhood became brighter!</i>

535
2166
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:08,490
I came to help with making kimchi.

536
2170
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,600
Then when she said someone was coming—

537
2174
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,200
- Yes, it was me.
- Who's here?!

538
2179
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,500
Oh, our son-in-law! Wow!

539
2183
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,450
Right, what brings you here?

540
2187
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:25,730
I came to make kimchi.

541
2191
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,720
Make kimchi?

542
2195
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,390
Yes.

543
2199
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:34,580
Good that you came. Come right in.

544
2203
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:39,240
Come in. Once the kimchi is made, let's eat pork wraps.

545
2207
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,400
- Sit. 
- No,

546
2212
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,380
I didn't come to eat pork wraps, but to help make kimchi.

547
2216
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,840
I <i>must</i> make kimchi.

548
2220
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,760
Truthfully, Ji Ho helped with the ancestral rites at

549
2224
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,900
my parents' house a few days ago. So we settled on exchanging

550
2228
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,890
the same amount of labor and effort.

551
2232
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,590
What nonsense is that? It's expected for the daughter-in-law to help prepare the rites!

552
2236
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,640
Did she? Ancestral rites?

553
2240
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,620
Yes.

554
2244
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,550
Don't speak nonsense and sit!

555
2248
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,140
Have a drink with me.

556
2252
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,170
Can you make kimchi wearing those clothes?

557
2256
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,500
If you're going to do it, you need to change first.

558
2260
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,720
Shall I give you my work clothes?

559
2264
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,310
Yes, I would be grateful if you gave them to me.

560
2268
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,830
Okay.

561
2272
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,880
<i>I arrived safely.</i>

562
2276
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,470
<i>I will start to make kimchi now.</i>

563
2280
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,930
Anything the matter?

564
2284
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,890
Nope.

565
2288
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:03,540
It's Soo Ji Noona.

566
2292
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,300
She's pretty today too. Totally my style.

567
2296
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,980
What?

568
2300
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:24,730
Nothing, you very quickly change

569
2304
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,330
who your style is.

570
2308
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:31,590
You used to tell me I was so pretty.

571
2312
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,200
I just thought you were a little cute.

572
2316
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,500
You're not my style originally.

573
2320
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:49,730
What? He went to make kimchi?

574
2324
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,960
Mhm.

575
2328
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,930
Wow, you're something else, but your landlord husband is the real piece of work.

576
2332
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,480
Well, that's probably why you two made a contract like that.

577
2336
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,420
What if he gets so fatigued that he can't even come back?

578
2340
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,400
Your mom probably bought at least 100 heads of cabbage, right?

579
2344
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,920
Nah, my family would not make their son-in-law work that hard.

580
2348
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,000
He'll probably eat some pork wraps and come back.

581
2352
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,560
You already know she won't really make him make kimchi.

592
2397
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:18,480

00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,830
shake off the water, and put them in there,

597
2418
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,050
and it's done. Understand?

598
2422
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,360
Do this in plain water,

599
2426
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,360
after the water drips off, put it... in there?

600
2430
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,430
Yeah, try it.

601
2434
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,930
Don't do it limply like that.

602
2438
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:55,460
With energy, like this, like this.

603
2442
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,710
Yes, energy.

604
2446
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,690
What will you do, when your son-in-law is so weak?

605
2450
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,540
If he keeps this up, would you ever even see your grandchild?

606
2454
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:08,910
Aigoo, don't you know that the skinny ones are better at those things?

607
2458
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,920
Be quiet.

608
2462
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,120
Watch what you say in front of my son-in-law.

609
2466
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,720
Aigoo, please wipe it one more time. (dialect meaning"wipe" = homonym of "steal")

610
2470
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,480
You want me to... steal it?

611
2474
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,700
No, like this. She means to do it like this.

612
2478
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,450
Ah, yes. Like this.

613
2482
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,460
I mean, just one more time,

614
2486
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,540
rinse it. With energy.

615
2490
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,730
Oh, what will we do with him?

616
2494
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:59,430
Why are you beating my son-in-law on his back like that?

617
2498
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,910
Huh? What is this?

618
2502
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,410
He's really making kimchi.

619
2506
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:24,130
What is this? Why are they hitting him?

620
2510
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,630
Ah, Psycho Ahjumma. This is no joke.

621
2514
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,100
I'd like to order, please.

622
2518
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,000
Yes.

623
2522
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,860
I'll take the order, you can go.

624
2526
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,450
- Go where?
 - To your husband.

625
2531
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,870
If you're so worried about him, hurry and go.

626
2535
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,470
Instead, come in and work all weekend and cover my shifts, okay?

627
2539
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,110
Aigoo, like this, we will be working all night.

00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,720

635
2572
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:58,830
Why's he squatting there next to the fire?

636
2576
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:04,660
Wow, Brother-in-law really came to make kimchi, huh?

637
2580
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,820
He is truly weird.

638
2584
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,900
Squeeze it well.

639

You're here? When did you come in here?

644

00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,840
Aigoo, you caused trouble, huh?

645
2612
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,060
Oh, I really wanted to read this book.

646
2616
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:59,380
It would be all right if I borrowed this, right?

647
2620
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:05,470
I'll read it with great care and make sure to return it, okay?

So this book was a gift from someone.

That's enough now. You can go inside.

653

No, there is still time left before I fulfill my promise.

660

00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,900
What's up? You were screaming and throwing fits last night.

661
2679
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:53,890
What is this? Are you going to shut down your app and start selling underwear?

662
2683
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:56,950
I bought the most comfortable design from all the brands around.

663
2687
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:01,170
At least one of them should fit you, I hope. So just try it, please.

664
2691
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:06,690
If it's still uncomfortable, I will do whatever I can to find another one for you.

665
2695
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,850
Something that you find comfortable.

666
2699
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:15,030
If it felt like I was giving you pressure, or that I was butting in,

667
2703
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,170
I am really sorry. I'll do my best to fix that.

668
2707
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:22,800
But please be a little more considerate towards me.

669
2711
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,830
And to be honest, I can dislike it.

670
2715
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:32,130
That someone would continue to stare at my woman, and think impure thoughts,

671
2719
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,440
I can dislike that.

672
2723
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:39,290
All right. I am sorry for only thinking of it as you butting in.

673
2727
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:44,550
And so you just turn off your phone?!? Think about how anxious that would make me feel!

674
2731
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,790
I turned it off because of a work meeting.

675
2735
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,680
Wait just one hour. Then let's have dinner together.

676
2739
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,310
- Dinner?
 - Stay in this area, okay?

677
2744
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,950
Aish, I'm so happy I can die.

678
2748
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,470
Thank you.

679
2752
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,580
Are you all right?

680
2756
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:32,210
Your shoulders and your back, how do you feel?

681
2760
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:37,050
Well, it aches a little, but I'm sure it will be fine in a little while.

682
2764
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:43,690
No, before it gets worse, I'll go to the pharmacy and buy some medicine and pain relief patches.

683

Ji Ho.

684
2772
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,270
Why did you come here? What about your job at the cafe?

685
2776
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:56,770
Ah, I took care of it so there won't be problems. You don't have to worry.

686
2780
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,520
Did you come... because you were worried about me?

687
2784
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,290
Yes.

688
2788
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,230
I see.

689
2792
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:19,300

01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,090
Yes!

744
3014
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:12,240
- Is it urgent?
 - Yes, yes, yes!

745
3019
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:22,230
All right, let's drink up.

746
3023
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:25,330
Are you all right? You drank a lot.

747
3027
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,420
I wouldn't say I'm alright.

748
3031
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:34,090
I am not. I'm only a few more drinks away from reaching my limit.

749
3035
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:37,040
Where did this house's son-in-law go?

750
3039
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,420
Hurry! Hurry!

751
3043
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,570
If you get caught by that ajusshi then there's no way out.

752
3047
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:51,430
If you just drink what he gives you, then you will die.

753
3051
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:54,050
You should have given me that important information ahead of time.

754
3055
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,670
What about Unni? Did she go somewhere?

755
3059
01:00:56,670 --> 01:01:00,920
Ah! She went to buy medicine for me and she still hasn't come back.

756
3063
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,190
Then don't come right home. Go and take a walk.

757
3067
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:08,450
That's right. Call Unni and enjoy a date together.

758
3071
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:09,510
Yes.

759
3075
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:13,200
Let's go.

760
3079
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,920
Do you know this is the first time that we are eating together?

761
3083
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,730
Is that so?

762
3087
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:40,600
We ate together that last time, before we went elsewhere.

763
3091
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,940
Ate what?

764
3095
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,620
We just drank rice wine. You were the one who drank six bottles and got drunk. Aiyoo.

765
3099
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,340
Rice wine is rice so isn't that considered eating?

766
3103
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,680
From now on, let's eat together like this

767
3107
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:56,490
at least three times a week. That's an order.

768
3111
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:57,800
Why whine about eating?

769
3115
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,020
You know how important a meal is, right?

770
3119
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:03,470
Do you think people say stuff like "rice strength" and "rice affection" for nothing?

771
3123
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:07,280
There's nothing like a meal to nourish mutual attachment.

772
3127
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,960
Well...

773
3131
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,870
That's why Ji Ho fell.

774
3135
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,670
Huh? Where would sister-in-law fall?

775
3139
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:18,510
That...

776
3143
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,430
Ji Ho fell for her landlord.

777
3147
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:27,070
My friend likes your friend.

778
3151
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:31,630
Don't tell your friend.

779
3155
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:34,530
It seems like she likes him one-sidedly.

780
3159
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,480
Is it really one-sided?

781
3163
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:44,290
What?

782
3167
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:47,490
Would Se Hee really not know

783
3171
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:50,010
that Ji Ho likes him?

784
3175
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,350
Ms. Ji Ho!

785
3179
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:06,040
Ms. Ji Ho!

786
3183
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,410
Ms. Ji Ho!

787
3187
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:52,710
That Ji Ho likes him?

788
3191
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,720
Then what about Mr. Se Hee? What does he feel towards Ji Ho?

789
3195
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:08,000
This place tastes good. It must be newly harvested rice.

790
3199
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,670
Jeez! Ji Ho is a mo-sol. She doesn't know  anything!
(Mo-sol: abbrev. of Mo-tae Sol-o, or single since birth)

791
3204
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:15,300
I'm so worried.

792
3208
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:25,160
Se Hee must be scared since he knows.

793
3212
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:30,990
Since he knows what love is...

794
3216
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,660
maybe Se Hee could be more scared because of it?

795
3220
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:43,720
<i>Timing and Subtitles Brought to You by the Scrimp & Scrape Team @ Viki!</i>

796
3224
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:48,580
You should have declined the rice wine.

797
3228
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:53,620
Someone who is usually good at declining things, why can't you, in that situation?

798
3232
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:59,720
Why?

799
3236
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,170
This must be how you felt.

800
3240
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:06,230
When I asked why you went to my family's memorial service.

801
3244
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,970
This regrettable feeling.

802
3248
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:23,070
It's nice, the sea. It's been a long time.

803
3252
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:26,990
Me too. The sea...

804
3256
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,290
it's my first time.

805
3260
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:36,080
Besides my family and friends,

806
3264
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,190
coming to see the beach with someone else.

807
3268
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,490
With a man...

808
3272
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:47,140
It's my first time seeing it.

809
3276
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:55,570
Unexpectedly, you have a lot of things you haven't done.

810
3280
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:58,530
That's right.

811
3284
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:03,330
I was constantly busy in my 20s.

812
3288
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:06,540
That's why I...

813
3292
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:09,450
have a lot of things I haven't done yet.

814
3296
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:12,600
That's why I also have a lot of things I don't know.

815
3300
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:16,140
I...

816
3304
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,900
liked a poem when I was in my 20s.

817
3308
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,500
In that poem, it says this.

818
3312
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:27,440
When a person comes

819
3316
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,640
that person's entire life comes with him.

820
3320
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,660
It's fragile, so it may have already been broken,

821
3324
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,840
that heart has come.

822
3328
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:42,830
When I liked that poem

823
3332
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:46,920
I didn't know what it meant.

824
3336
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,410
When I found out what it meant,

825
3340
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:53,460
I could no longer enjoy that poem.

826
3344
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,770
Once you know something,

827
3348
01:06:56,770 --> 01:07:00,220
there are many things you can no longer do. That is life.

828
3352
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,040
That's why I...

829
3356
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,170
am envious of you, Ji Ho.

830
3360
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:14,530
Not knowing

831
3364
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:17,380
is a good thing.

832
3368
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:22,250
That's why,

833
3372
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,790
don't worry too much.

834
3376
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,680
The same goes for you, Se Hee.

835
3380
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:38,380
Even if it's the same ocean that I saw before,

836
3384
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:43,390
today, this ocean, it's the first time for me.

837
3388
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:48,010
Even things that I know, things that I have done,

838
3392
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:53,100
in that moment, with that person, it's the first time, still.

839
3396
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:00,270
Us... just like our marriage.

840
3400
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:04,740
Like the kiss at the bus stop.

841
3404
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:10,540
The things that happen after that moment...

842
3408
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:15,800
I think they're not anyone's fault.

843
3412
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,400
Just...

844
3416
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,860
it happened like that.

845
3420
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:26,370
Like how some waves just flow by,

846
3424
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:30,620
and some waves break.

847
3428
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,750
It just happens. That's why,

848
3432
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,050
Se Hee, you too,

849
3436
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,850
shouldn't worry too much.

850
3440
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:50,040
Just because you have lived yesterday,

851
3444
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:53,540
it doesn't mean

852
3448
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,640
that you know everything about today.

853
3452
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,350
<i>A person coming</i>

854
3456
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:03,160
<i>is in fact a tremendous thing.</i>

855
3460
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,790
<i>It is because one person's</i>

856
3464
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:09,300
<i>entire life is coming with her.</i>

857
3468
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,920
<i>Because it is fragile,</i>

858
3472
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:16,480
<i>and so</i>

859
3476
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,890
<i>it may have been broken before</i>

860
3480
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:23,520
<i>that heart</i>

861
3484
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,770
<i>comes.</i>

862
3488
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:32,890
Now I understand why people come to see the ocean when they are frustrated.

863
3492
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:39,030
Here, you are able to meet your own feelings.

864
3496
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:40,840
Pardon?

865
3500
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,540
But you know,

866
3504
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:46,630
there is something I've wanted to correct since a while ago.

867
3508
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:51,990
What you did at the bus stop was not a kiss. It was a peck.

868
3512
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:56,630
Ahhh...

869
3516
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,180
Did you really have to...?

870
3520
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:02,150
Yes.

871
3524
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:04,710
The truth is, you can't even call it a peck.

872
3528
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:06,920
If one had to define it accurately,

873
3532
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,090
it was just skin-to-skin contact, which just happened to be of lips.

874
3536
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,670
Yes, that would be an accurate definition.

875
3540
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,370
Yes. I understand.

876
3544
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:22,350
You can't call that a kiss.

877
3548
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:28,080
That is not how you do a kiss.

878
3552
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,830
I understand, I said. I didn't do it well.

879
3556
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:35,220
Yes. That's what I am saying. A kiss...

880
3560
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,530
is done like this.

888

do you need to do it more?

01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:59,200
<i>that heart of his...</i>

897
3628
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,390
<i>came to me.</i>

898
3632
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:05,670
♫ <i>Living through each day </i> ♫

899
3636
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:10,060
♫ <i>Like a fool, repeating </i> ♫

900
3640
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:13,760
♫ <i>I stand alone again in one corner</i> ♫

901
3644
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:21,180
♫ <i>Just in case tomorrow is actually different</i> ♫

902
3648
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:24,920
<i>Because This Is My First Life</i>

903
3652
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:29,370
<i>All the romance cells in my body have woken up.</i>

904
3656
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:31,340
<i>This woman is pretty.</i>

905
3660
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:35,270
<i>You don't want to do it with your landlord? You live in the same house, doesn't your body...</i>

906
3664
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:37,330
<i>Go and shower first.</i>

907
3668
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:39,080
<i>Why did I do that? Why?</i>

908
3672
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,560
<i>In a day how many times</i>

909
3676
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:45,770
<i>do I think about kissing? You mo-sol (single since birth)!</i>

910
3680
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:50,300
<i>About our wedding, can you wait a little bit longer?</i>

911
3684
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:53,430
<i>I am just curious about my girlfriend's house.</i>

912
3688
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:54,800
<i>You came?</i>

913
3692
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,510
<i>These days, what do people do when on a date?</i>

914
3696
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:59,300
<i>Oh?</i>

915
3700
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,410
<i>I... am scared of myself</i>

916
3704
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,790
<i>in case I might hurt someone again.</i>
