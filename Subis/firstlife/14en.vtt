00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,530
Hello.

163
654
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,590
I'm in charge of CEO Ma's company's finance. Shin Young Hyo.

164
658
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,420
Ah, yes.

165
662
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,170
I don't have a business card.

166
666
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,910
I will be going ahead, CEO.

167
670
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,810
Ah, right. Ms. Ho Rang.

168
674
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,600
I will call you. Take care.

169
678
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,190
Yes.

170
682
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,440
Yes.

171
686
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,430
I heard from CEO Ma that you are headed to Silim-dong.

172
690
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,090
Yes.

173
694
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,290
I will give you a ride. The bus in this neighborhood comes really late.

174
698
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,410
No, it's okay. You don't have to.

175
702
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,300
I'm not a bad person. I have known CEO Ma for a long time.

176
706
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,710
You must live there?

177
710
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,100
No. Just...

178
714
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,890
I just need to get my things.

179
718
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,630
I see.

180
722
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,110
But then, Ms. Ho Rang, do you really not know who I am?

181
726
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,270
Pardon?

182
730
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,900
I want to get married.

183
734
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,460
Huh?

184
738
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,890
Gyeolmalrae! We chatted on it after you accepted my 'like.'

185
742
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,190
Ahhh.

186
746
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,610
Honestly, I was really startled earlier.

187
750
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,530
I recognized you at first glance.

188
754
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,110
Yes.

189
758
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,610
After I installed that app, the first person I talked to was you.

190
762
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,330
But you haven't replied since then,

191
766
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,940
so I thought I was rejected for sure.

192
770
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,520
That...

193
774
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,830
That time, I too just registered for the first time so I just replied without any thoughts

194
778
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,840
since it was CEO Ma's app.

195
782
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,500
Are you trying to draw a boundary now?

196
786
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,760
- Pardon?
 - What's this?

197
791
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,380
If you're startled like that, you are acknowledging as such?

198
795
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,370
For real, an irrefutable part?

199
799
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,260
Thank you for giving me a ride. Take care.

200
803
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,960
Yes—

201
807
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,280
Take care.

212
857
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,700
Why are you here? You didn't leave?

213
861
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,450
No, since you said you were here to get your things and I thought maybe they would be heavy.

214
865
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,580
And I noticed you weren't in a good condition since earlier.

215
869
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,260
Pardon?

216
873
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,040
Give it to me. I will give you a ride.

217
877
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,570
No.

218
881
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,520
I would be too burdened if you do this.

219
885
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,990
At a glance, it's obvious that you are about to get sick.

220
889
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,820
You've got a body flu, acknowledge to the left, acknowledge to the right, acknowledge to the front?

221
893
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,140
Pardon?

222
897
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,790
No, your face shows that you're on the edge of collapsing.

223
901
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,020
How could I pretend not to notice and just go?

224
905
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,970
Give it to me, Ms. Ho Rang.

225
909
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,530

232
937
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,150
The lawsuit, we will proceed with it as we discussed.

233
941
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:44,700
In the process of investigation, you would have to personally be investigated as the victim.

234
945
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,470
Are you alright with that?

235
949
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,060
Yes.

236
953
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,440
I already know that.

237
957
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,610
Thankfully, you have the call and text records with that assistant director

238
961
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,620
so it will help.

239
965
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,900
Just that, once their side starts playing with the media

240
969
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,620
it will be noisy,

241
973
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,520
especially since it's in the broadcast field to begin with.

242
977
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,200
Yes. Once it starts I should prepare myself.

243
981
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,600
Okay. Then we will proceed as is.

244
985
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,590
And also,

245
989
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,500
this is the contract.
 <i>Program format: 20 70-minute episodes for a mini-series, Pay: 10 million won (~$92,000)</i>

246
994
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,900
There's no need for you to sign right away.

247
998
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,050
You can take it and look through it,

248
1002
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,640
and if you want any adjustments to be made you can just tell me.

249
1006
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,820
But then...

250
1010
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,850
the amount is...

251
1014
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,450
Is more negotiation needed?

252
1018
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,700
Ah, it's less than the amount you expected.

253
1022
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,890
No.

254
1026
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,620
I think it's too much.

255
1030
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,450
Writer, you can't be like that.

256
1034
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,060
Pardon?

257
1038
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,230
Even if you are surprised, you should go out and be surprised on your own.

258
1042
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,270
We are doing a contract, so how could you show what you feel in front of an enemy?

259
1046
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,440
CEO, you are not an enemy though.

260
1050
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,380
It's not a lot.

261
1054
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,150
By our company's standard, that is the starting for newbie writers.

262
1058
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,880
Honestly, our company doesn't sign contracts with writers that much.

263
1062
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,160
But if we do, we do it the right way.

264
1066
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,990
If we think it's a person we will be working with for a long time.

265
1070
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,610
CEO.

266
1074
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,050
Yes?

267
1078
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,760
Today...

268
1082
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,510
should we eat?

269
1086
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,860
Sure.

<i>What is that? / In this world working for money is the easiest thing. Of course, there are things you can't put a monetary value on. You shouldn't just say it's good or valuable. Sometimes you must show it.</i>

<i>Go Jeong Min</i>

276
1114
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,180
Writer, did you cure your hangover this morning?

277
1118
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,910
I drank warm honey water before sleeping

278
1122
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,260
and it was okay.

279
1126
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,820
Ahh. Did you husband prepare it for you?

280
1130
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,030
Yes.

281
1134
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,690
My husband...

282
1138
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,200
prepared it for me.

283
1142
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,360
Before we sign a contract, I have something I am curious about.

284
1146
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,450
Yes, Writer?

285
1150
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,220
Regarding the person you told me before.

286
1154
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,880
The one you almost married.

287
1158
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,770
Yes.

288
1162
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,900
If you were to meet him again,

289
1166
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,700
how do you think it would be?

290
1170
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,230
Even if you meet him again,

291
1174
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,330
do you think you will love him still?

292
1178
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,160
This...

293
1182
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,270
is this question related to the contract?

294
1186
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,390
Yes.

295
1190
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:24,620
It is an important question that is related to the contract.

296
1194
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,560
Honestly, I met him.

297
1198
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,700
That friend.

298
1202
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,430
The day when we went to your neighborhood,

299
1206
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,250
that day,

300
1210
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,850
by coincidence.

301
1214
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,230
That's why right now, your question is a bit...

302
1218
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,380
all the more

303
1222
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,380
strange, I feel.

304
1226
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,010
For me, on that day...

305
1230
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,090
He came to get me.

306
1234
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,770
Se Hee did.

307
1238

309
1246

<i>you lived only criticizing the world.</i>

310
1250
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,670
<i>For once, grab the world and stand properly in front of it</i>

311
1254
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,770
<i>and face it head on.</i>

312
1258
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,440
<i>That's what I think you must do.</i>

313
1262
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,850
<i>And when you start, I will be by your side to hang in there with you.</i>

314
1266
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,810
Have you been to K Ventures again today?

315
1270
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,210
Yes, I had some additional investments to discuss with them.

316
1274
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,850
Okay. Work hard.

317
1278
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,030
That... Deputy Park.

318
1282
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,930
Would you like to smoke a cigarette with me?

319
1286
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,020
Right now?

320
1290
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,500
Yes.

321
1294
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,960
No. I'm okay.

322
1298
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,900
What do you want to say?

323
1302
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,690
It was 2015 when I came to this team

324
1306
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,520
and it's already been three years that we've worked together.

325
1310
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,860
If you calculate it by work days it would be 800 days.

326
1314
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,960
If you calculate it by time it's 7,200 hours.

327
1318
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,230
- Is that so?
 - Yes.

328
1323
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,520
But you know, those many hours,

329
1327
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,960
for me, in general, it was horrible.

330
1331
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,100
- Horrible?
- Yes.

331
1336
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:14,150
If it was a day where we would have a company dinner I would be pondering how I should smile to your sexual innuendos.

332
1340
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:20,480
And if it was after my vacation, you would probably ask where I went with my boyfriend.

333
1344
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,640
Then what would I give as an answer?

334
1348
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,880
When I didn't feel good, I'd be afraid that you'd ask, "Is it that time of the month?"

335
1352
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,740
So I couldn't even act as if I was sick.

336
1356
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:36,420
So when I think about you, all I have is just horrible and painful memories.

337
1360
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,270
But you are still a colleague that I've worked with for 7,200 hours.

338
1364
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,560
Isn't that so sad?

339
1368
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,330
Well. So what do you want to say?

340
1372
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,700
About all the hurt that I have received all this time

341
1376
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,660
I want you to apologize.

342
1380
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,400
What?

343
1384
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,870
I need to receive an apology

344
1388
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,060
from you.

345
1392
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:05,000
In a place where all the people from our team are present, please apologize officially.

346
1396
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,890
Apologize?

347
1400
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:13,330
I really want to end this horrible connection with you.

348
1404
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:18,340
Today, I gathered all my sincerity to talk to you, so

349
1408
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,240
please show your sincerity, too.

350
1412
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,240
Then, I will be waiting.

351
1416

♫ The leaves are "swish swish" (Woo Soo [Ji]) falling

352
1420

353
1424
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,250
No.

354
1428
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,130
It's nice to see you.

355
1432
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,960
Why are you so cute?

356
1436
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,240
What you said was right.

357
1440
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,620
I just avoided it and cursed.

358
1444
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,290
I have never conversed with Deputy Park while looking at each other.

359
1448
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:19,010
He is someone's son and a family's head of household though.

360
1452
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,280
My Soo Ji is really cool.

361
1456
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,590
This punk! Come here!

362
1460
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,440
What's wrong with you?

363
1464
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,760
You don't like this?

364
1468
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,550
No.

365
1472
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,450
So you don't like it. At least not yet.

371
1496
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:42,100
How in the world... could the two meet like this?

372
1500
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,730
Sister-in-law— No.

373
1504
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,790
Does Ms. Ji Ho know?

374
1508
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,060
Well, how could she know?

375
1512
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,560
This unbelievable situation.

376
1516
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,880
So they are working together?

377
1520
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,690
Probably.

378
1524
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,930
Shouldn't you be the first one to tell her about it?

379
1528
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,980
It's not even a job where they can bump into each other once in a while.

380
1532
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,070
If it's a production CEO and the writer, then they would see each other a lot.

381
1536
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,840
What...

382
1540
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,450
should I say?

383
1544
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:27,800
How much should I tell her?

384
1548
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,620
That she was someone I dated long ago.

385
1552
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,590
Or... that time I spent with her was stained

386
1556
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,280
with my pride and my foolishness?

387
1560
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,740
Whatever I say, she would get hurt

388
1564
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,530
because Ms. Ji Ho is a transparent person.

389
1568
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:55,190
To add my stain to her transparent self...

390
1572
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,490
I don't want that.

391
1576
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,200
I didn't mean Ms. Ji Ho, though.

392
1580
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,460
I was talking about Jeong Min.

393
1584
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,440
I was going to ask how you are going to explain Ms. Ji Ho to Jeong Min.

394
1588
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,240
You... it wasn't that you couldn't forget Jeong Min?

395
1592
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,320
Isn't that why you

396
1596
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,580
married with a contract?

397
1600
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,150
After all, Ms. Ji Ho

398
1604
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,520
has just a contractual relationship with you.

399
1608
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,920
Wasn't she just a tenant to you?

400
1612
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,930
So you weren't worried about Jeong Min.

465
1872
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:09,470
was to the house that we shared up until now.

00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,160
Ah.

467
1880
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,860
However...

468
1884
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,520
How could you have so little luggage?

469
1888
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,460
What?

470
1892
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,560
It's understandable.

471
1896
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,390
Even if you date for a long time, when you break up, there isn't really that much stuff to pack.

472
1900
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,760
Ah, I also dated my first girlfriend for seven years.

473
1904
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,660
However,

474
1908
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,460
why did you two break up?

475
1912
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,730
We just fought a lot because of the topic of marriage.

476
1916
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:52,390
Turns out, dating and marriage are very different.

477
1920
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,400
So how are you planning to overcome this situation?

478
1924
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,760
What?

479
1928
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,630
Your break up. Have you come up with a plan on how to overcome it?

480
1932
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,370
Well, I don't really have one as of now.

481
1936
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,260
Well, time is medicine, they say.

482
1940
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,540
How can time be medicine?

483
1944
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,230
Time is just merely time.

484
1948
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:31,560
The thing I hate most are these don't-go-over, triple, tuna board cliched phrases.

485
1952
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,490
You can't get fooled by these cliches, Ho Rang.

486
1956
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,350
Don't-go-over, triple, what?

487
1960
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:44,700
You see, for a person, when they really want something, they have to speak it aloud in order for it to happen.

488
1964
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:50,270
So every morning, noon, and night, I would say my wishes out loud looking at my reflection in the mirror.

489
1968
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,270
So what did you say?

490
1972
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,750
"I can forget her. I can overcome this breakup."

491
1976
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:02,860
Like a zombie spirit, I will end this for all and get the whole world.

492
1980
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,930
Please don't say those multi-syllable words in front of me. I'm not that smart, so I don't understand those.

493
1984
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:15,890
Ah, those aren't multi-syllable words. Those are abbreviations that young people use these days.

494
1988
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,500
What?

495
1992
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,450
No. Why do you say those types of things?

496
1996
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,770
It makes me feel better.

497
2000
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,050
It also makes me feel younger.

498
2004
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:49,010
Uhm, I've been here before.

499
2008
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,290
<i>Director Gye Yong Seok</i>

500
2012
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,130
<i>Some man told me this was for Unit 401 and left it here.</i>

501
2016
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,660
<i>Okay.</i>

502
2020
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,230
<i>Since you told me not to call you, I'm leaving your bag here.
 Gye Yong Seok</i>

503
2025
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,340
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

504
2029
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,120
Yes.

505
2033
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,720
I know

506
2037
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,910
that you came before to leave some luggage.

507
2041
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,410
I see.

508
2045
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:16,480
I didn't know she got married.

509
2049
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,970
I'm sorry.

510
2053
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:25,500
I just had a lot of drinks that night, so I don't really remember.

511
2057
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,130
I'm being serious. Please believe me.

512
2061
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:32,710
I will do whatever I can to make up for it. I will pay you as much settlement money as you want...

513
2065
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,370
So, first, could she please withdraw the criminal complaint?

514
2069
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,730
I need to work on this new project.

515
2073
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,460
What?

516
2077
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,190
<i>I had a dream about me walking alone</i>

517
2081
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:57,540
<i>in an endless tunnel.</i>

518
2085
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,600
I... well...

519
2089
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,660
I thought you knew about it.

520
2093
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,550
I think this is something that I need to talk to her about directly.

521
2097
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,470
Then, sorry for bothering you.

522
2101
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,590
I'll talk to her.

523
2105
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,700
Sit down.

524
2109
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,850
You will talk to me.

525
2113
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,680
Properly. And everything.

526
2117
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,410
Thank you

527
2121
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,850
for telling me something that's hard to share with anyone.

528
2125
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,340
I also have something I'm curious about.

529
2129
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,770
If I met Se Hee again, would I love him again.

530
2133
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,520
If my answer was yes,

531
2137
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,820
what would your conclusion be?

532
2141
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,060
If that was your answer,

533
2145
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,780
I would probably end up being your enemy.

534
2149
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,680
Then were we supposed to be fighting?

535
2153
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,400
Right here, grabbing each other's hair?

536
2157
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,080
I would probably have waited

537
2161
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,120
for Se Hee's heart.

538
2165
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,330
You would've waited.

539
2169
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,540
Why? Is it because it's a contract marriage?

540
2173
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,240
Even if it was a real marriage,

541
2177
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,920
I would've done the same thing.

542
2181
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,690
Being a married couple doesn't mean

543
2185
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:01,680
you automatically have all of each other's heart.

544
2189
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,690
Is that so?

545
2193
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:11,320
However, honestly, isn't that what marriage is?

546
2197
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,600
Isn't it an institution to show that you have each other's heart

547
2201
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,430
and are officially declaring it?

548
2205
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:25,040
So even if you have a change of heart, it ties you down and makes it hard for you to leave.

549
2209
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,290
I'm not quite sure

550
2213
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,120
since this is my first time getting married

551
2217
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,180
and experiencing love, too.

552
2221
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,130
So there are a lot of things I don't know,

553
2225
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,820
but there's one thing I'm sure of.

554
2229
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,290
A heart isn't something that is taken or grabbed.

555
2233
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,320
It just comes to you.

556
2237
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:11,170
Please keep it a secret from Se Hee that I know about this.

557
2241
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,350
<i>Be well.</i>

558
2245
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:41,460
<i>Go back and live like nothing ever happened</i>

559
2249
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,760
<i>Instead, don't ever love anyone.</i>

560
2253
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,190
<i>You have no right to.</i>

561
2257
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,840
I know, right?

562
2261
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,900
A heart wasn't something to be stolen or grabbed.

563
2265
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,650
Imagine, she already knows that.

564
2269
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,100
I'm envious of you, Writer.

565
2273
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,790
Your phone call was long.

566
2277
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:22,190
Ah, yeah. It was the lawyer.

567
2281
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,490
There was a problem with Writer Yoon's criminal charge with that guy.

568
2285
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,760
What?

569
2289
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,990
What happened?

570
2293
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,940
About that...

571
2297
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,690
That Assistant Director must've gone to find her to beg her to drop the criminal complaint,

572
2301
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:36,090
but he got beaten up. Pretty badly, I hear.

573
2305
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,620
By whom?

574
2309
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,330
Writer Yoon's husband.

575
2313
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,080
What?!

576
2317
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,700
He...

577
2321
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,750
hit a person?

578
2325
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,410
It's been a long time.

579
2329
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:52,320
Deputy Park, you did well this year. Let's have a good year next year, too.

580
2333
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,100
Hey, should we all have a toast? Fill your glasses.

581
2337
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,770
Everyone fill their glasses.

582
2341
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,390
You should give the toast, Deputy Park.

583
2345
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,060
Alright!

584
2349
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:09,980
There is not much more left of 2017. Our Team Leader, who we respect, we love you!

585
2353
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,730
And our business team family, this year, you have all worked so hard.

586
2357
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:19,220
With love in our hearts for our Team Leader, when I say, 'Team Leader!' you say,

587
2361
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,490
'We love you.' You got that?

588
2365
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,020
Ah, that's right, the apology.

589
2369
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,500
I'm sorry, Deputy Woo.

590
2373
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:33,040
I've been a bit mischievous, haven't I? Well, take a drink and let's forget everything, okay?

591
2377
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,160
All together now. Team Leader,

592
2381
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,340
- I love you! 
- I love you!

593
2386
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,190
Drink up.

594
2390
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,120
Where shall we go for the second round?

595
2394
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,190
Did something happen between you two?

596
2398
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,010
No. Nothing happened. Drink.

597
2402
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,050
Drink, drink.

598
2406
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:57,260
Have a glass.

599
2410
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,120
<i>Chief.</i>

600
2414
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,560
Okay, I'm leaving first.

601
2418
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,730
- Have a goodnight, Team Leader.
 - Don't be out too late.

602
2423
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,910
- Goodbye.
 - See you!

603
2428
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,890
How about we have a round 2, Deputy.

604
2432
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,390
Deal!

605
2436
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,700
Let's have some beef sashimi and afterwards, karaoke, deal?

606
2440
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,740
Karaoke, deal!

607
2444
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,500
I'm going to stop by the office really quick.

608
2448
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,420
Wait for me!

609
2452
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,340
- Okay!
 - We'll wait for you there!

610
2457
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:30,460
Yes, a deserted island.

611
2461
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,430
Whose turn is it now?

612
2465
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:37,620
<i>Yes, Baby?</i>

613
2469
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,520
Language was created for humans to communicate with each other, right?

614
2473
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,560
That's right.

615
2477
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,680
If you can't use words to communicate with it, it's not human, is it?

616
2481
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,150
Of course. If words don't work, then it is not human.

617
2485
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:51,590
Either they are an animal, insect, or water flea. But why are you asking all of a sudden?

618
2489
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:57,590
Oppa, were you sincere when you said you'll have my back once I begin?

619
2493
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,060
Of course, I was sincere.

620
2497
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,680
- Take your turn.
 - Hurry and roll the dice, CEO.

621
2502
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,790
<i>CEO.</i>

622
2506
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:07,720
All right, roll the dice well.

623
2510
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,860
I love you.

624
2514
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,490
Hello? Hello, Baby?

625
2518
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,160
What was that?

626
2522
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,880
She's speaking like it's her last will and testament.

627
2526
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,260
- It's your turn, CEO.
 - Hurry up.

628
2531
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,140
Is that Seoul?

629
2535
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,450
No way...

630
2539
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,650
No, no, no, no!

631
2543
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:44,190
What do you mean no? You have to buy Seoul now, CEO.

632
2547
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,460
That scaredy cat, seriously.

633
2551
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:12,120
<i>Deputy Woo needs to show her body in her profile picture.</i>

634
2555
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,150
<i>B? B? No, no no.</i>

635
2559
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,990
<i>A full A. A very full A.</i>

636
2563
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:20,300
<i>If only I wasn't married,</i>

637
2567
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,620
<i>together with Deputy Woo... Yeah?</i>

638
2571
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:40,660
Oh? Deputy Woo, why did you come here?

639
2575
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,910
There's something I need to settle.

640
2579
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,460
Is that so?

641
2583
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,810
Jin Ho!

642
2587
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,300
What?

643
2591
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:55,980
Ouch.

644
2595
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,990
Oh.

645
2599
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:14,400
Here it goes.

646
2603
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,030
Tak, tak, tak. Pak. I'm buying Taipei.

647
2607
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,970
I was going to buy that though.

648
2611
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:23,030
They say that a place where when the tiger (horangi) is not around the rabbit plays king.

649
2615
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,980
What? Is this all Won Seok-nim's land?

650
2619
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,700
- Yeah.
 - Whoa. We really raised a baby tiger (horangi).

651
2624
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,170
That's why you should have bought it earlier.

652
2628
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:33,970
You need to get in the tiger's (horangi) den in order to catch the baby tiger (horangi).

653
2632
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,260
Let's stop playing this now.

654
2636
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,270
Why? It's getting fun.

655
2640
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:40,080
What's fun about it? We're not even kids. We just play stuff like this every day.

656
2644
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,180
Let's go have a drink. My treat!

657
2648
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,370
Really?

658
2652
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,020
Your treat?

659
2656
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,240
Yes. I will treat everyone today. Let's have a crazy night.

660
2660
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,510
Then I will be going first.

661
2664
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:51,690
No, Bo Mi-nim should come too.

662
2668
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,620
No thanks, I have an appointment today.

663
2672
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,120
At this time, what appointment?

664
2676
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,190
Should I call it an appointment with myself?

665
2680
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:01,060
Have fun. I will be going first.

666
2684
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,780
Ah! It's Friday, right? Bo Mi-nim must be going to Itaewon again.

667
2688
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,690
Itaewon?

668
2692
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:10,350
There's a famous figure shop there.

669
2696
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,970
Every Friday she calls it an appointment with herself. I think she must be geeking out at that shop.

670
2700
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:17,300
Ah. It does suit her well.

671
2704
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:22,230
Ah! Since you mention Itaewon, should we go to a club just us guys?

672
2708
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:24,670
C-Club?

673
2712
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,800
Yeah. Club. What's the point of leaving our perfectly fine bodies?

674
2716
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,810
We should play hard while we're single, isn't it so?

675
2720
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,900
Oh, it seems like you go to clubs a lot.

676
2724
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,560
I haven't gone even once.

677
2728
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:59,760
- I think my ears are going to bleed. 
- I didn't know it would be like this either.

678
2733
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,650
Ah! I think my eyes are going to bleed.

679
2737
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,390
Let's not stay here. Let's go down there and have fun!

680
2741
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,620
No.

681
2745
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,760
You should go ahead.

682
2749
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,390
Then I will play downstairs so follow me later.

683
2753
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,250
Yes. Yes.

684
2757
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,410
Then I will be going down.

685
2761
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,260
Yes.

686
2765
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:37,630
Yang Ho Rang, I will forget you. Yang Ho Rang, I will forget you!

687
2769
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,650
I will forget you!

688
2773
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,990
Oh.

689
2777
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:33,330
Oh?

690
2781
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:37,120
Him? What's with him?

691
2785
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,870
Oh! Bo Mi-nim!

692
2789
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:42,290
Get down!

693
2793
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:44,500
Hey, I'm so scared.

694
2797
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,210
Then do you want to go to the internet cafe? Let's go!

695
2801
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,420
No...

696
2805
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:56,080
You said you had an appointment!

697
2809
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,820
On the stage, you talk with your body and not with your mouth.

698
2813
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,810
Body?

00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:00,430
Ah, the one that was here got sold today.

720

Ah. Thank you.

721
2909

Yes.

722
2913
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:16,810
Hello, Father-in-law.

723
2917
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,660
A bit...

724
2921
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,370
you hit him a lot.

725
2925
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:33,240
Will it cause problems

726
2929
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,390
for Ji Ho?

727
2933
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:39,020
I think it will be okay.

728
2937
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,850
Just in time, I just met the CEO from that side.

729
2941
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:47,580
We know each other from before, so he won't make it into a bigger problem.

730
2945
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,920
Okay. Thanks.

731
2949
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,560
That...

732
2953
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:01,030
Me being Ji Ho's husband,

733
2957
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,890
does that

734
2961
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:05,580
affect you?

735
2965
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,090
And on Ji Ho's writing career?

736
2969
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:12,960
Is that why you came to see me?

737
2973
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,740
Because of the dregs of an old love

738
2977
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,120
that I might ruin Writer's work?

739
2981
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,170
That I might hurt her career?

740
2985
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,720
Yeah.

741
2989
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:38,840
When I got married, there's a favor that Ji Ho's mother asked of me.

742
2993
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:43,570
When Ji Ho would want to write again

743
2997
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:47,140
she asked that I allow her to write again.

744
3001
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,000
So that she doesn't give up on her dreams

745
3005
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,980
she asked me to do that for Ji Ho.

746
3009
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:02,020
But honestly, I don't know how to do that,

747
3013
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,540
so I just promised that I won't be a hindrance.

748
3017
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:10,300
But

749
3021
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,850
you do know. So that Ji Ho...

750
3025
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,340
How to help Ji Ho to not give up on her dream.

751
3029
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,920
So that is why you came to see me.

752
3033
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,070
To an old lover who you met after 12 years,

753
3037
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,610
and this is all you have to say to me?

754
3041
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,700
I hate you for this, a little.

755
3045
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,890
I'm sorry.

756
3049
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:50,640
But then, there was nothing that I could do.

757
3053
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,770
Why she decided to stop writing,

758
3057
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:57,750
I only found out for the first time today.

759
3061
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:01,440
And the only thing that I could do was swing my fists.

760
3065
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:06,230
I heard that you were a very good producer.

761
3069
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,680
Jeong Min...

762
3073
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,610
Not as my wife,

763
3077
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,980
but please look at her as a writer.

764
3081
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,680
I ask that of you.

01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:49,620
<i>and go into a person's heart</i>

771
3109
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,940
<i>and continue to live.</i>

772
3113
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,540
<i>Those words that lived in my heart for 12 years,</i>

773
3117
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,020
<i>how did they suddenly</i>

774
3121
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,630
<i>disappear completely?</i>

775
3125
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,590
<i>I tried so hard,</i>

776
3129
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,100
<i>but those words</i>

777
3133
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,420
<i>would not be erased.</i>

778
3137
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,260
I have something to ask you, too.

779
3141
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,530
You.

780
3145
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:25,550
Have you confessed your love to her?

781
3149
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:30,730
What?

782
3153
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,520
Confession.

783
3157
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,900
"I like you" or

784
3161
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,140
well...

785
3165
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,750
A confession similar to that, have you tried?

786
3169
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:49,240
No. I just... Must one say those words aloud?

787
3173
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,540
So you haven't.

788
3177
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,750
Do you know that?

789
3181
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,080
That you never did that

790
3185
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,770
for me, not even once?

791
3189
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,250
Confession.

792
3193
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:08,990
♫ <i>among so many hours</i> ♫

793
3197
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,330
I will be going.

794
3201
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,950
Okay.

795
3205
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,970
Words, too...

796
3209
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,160
have to get into a person's heart in order to live on.

797
3213
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:25,670
And you have to get it out of your mouth so that it can go into a person's heart.

798
3217
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,690
<i>It was not a coincidence.</i>

799
3221
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,700
<i>So now,</i>

800
3225
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:39,160
<i>drawing a line on purpose,</i>

801
3229
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,110
<i>please don't.</i>

802
3233
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:44,970
<i>It was due to those words. </i>

803
3237
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,590
<i>It's no one's fault is what I think. </i>

804
3241
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,410
<i> Like how some waves just flow by</i>

805
3245
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:58,710
<i>while others break apart. </i>

806
3249
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,090
<i>It's just how it is. </i>

807
3253
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:11,300
<i>Her warm words piled up and piled up more.</i>

808
3257
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,380
<i>You too, Se Hee.</i>

809
3261
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:16,700
<i>You shouldn't worry too much either.</i>

810
3265
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,800
<i>Just because you've lived yesterday,</i>

811
3269
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:25,470
<i>it doesn't mean you know</i>

812
3273
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:27,650
<i>everything about today.</i>

813
3277
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:33,720
<i>In my dead heart</i>

814
3281
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,400
<i>this word lived.</i>

815
3285
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,770
<i>Woori (we/us).</i>

816
3289
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:48,160
Are you still doing that part-time job?

817
3293
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,090
Oh, yes.

818
3297
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:53,790
But I think I might quit soon.

819
3301
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:57,380
Good. Good thinking.

820
3305
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,480
Yes.

821
3309
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,990
After I quit, I think I will start writing again.

822
3313
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,020
By writing, you mean, what?

823
3317
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:09,940
That drama?

824
3321
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,340
Yes.

825
3325
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:17,740
Didn't you say you quit that? To focus on homemaking?

826
3329
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,680
Yes, but

827
3333
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,400
a good opportunity came to me somehow,

828
3337
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,850
so I thought I might try to start again.

829
3341
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:28,920
What about kids?

830
3345
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,020
What?

831
3349
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,600
When are you going to have a baby, then?

832
3353
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,930
Oh.

833
3357
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:38,740
I haven't really . . .

834
3361
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:42,570
You should think about having babies, even though work is important too.

835
3365
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:46,390
You're still young but Se Hee's not.

836
3369
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:58,750
Use that to pay off the loan and later on, when you've had a baby, you can use it to supplement the living costs.

837
3373
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,290
What?

838
3377
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:04,120
I promised I would do this when he got married.

839
3381
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:06,650
Oh.

840
3385
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:11,660
I don't think it's something for me to accept.

841
3389
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,700
Then who should accept it?

842
3393
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,380
Oh. Of course, you should give it to Se Hee directly.

843
3397
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,320
What would he and I meet and talk about?

844
3401
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,600
If I gave it to him, he wouldn't take it anyway, so it's right for you to take it.

845
3405
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:29,490
The wife taking care of these things behind the scenes is important, too.

846
3409
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,990
Let's go now.

847
3413
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:35,140
Wait, Father-in-law.

848
3417
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:43,370
I have something to say to you.

849
3421
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:46,480
It's cold, so careful going back.

850
3425
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,520
Where are you? Why aren't you coming?

851
3429
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,660
Oh, I'll be coming in a bit.

852
3433
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,900
What time is it! Hurry and come home!

853
3437
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:18,640
<i>Hey, am I a kid? Don't-go-over, triple, tuna board!</i>

854
3441
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:20,630
<i>See you later!</i>

855
3445
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:21,780
Over, triple?

856
3449
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,800
What tuna?

857
3453
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,680
At least it's a relief that she seems to be in a good mood.

858
3457
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:31,050
Tada.

859
3461
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,930
Soo Ji. You know the movie, "The Graduate," right?

860
3465
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:44,800
Of course. It's your favorite movie.

861
3469
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:48,100
I saw that over ten times.

862
3473
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,300
I saw it for the first time when I was a first-year in high school.

863
3477
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:55,690
When Benjamin barged into Elaine's wedding

864
3481
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:59,430
and grabbed her hand and led out, I fell for that scene.

865
3485
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:02,090
How should I say it?

866
3489
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:06,670
To my seventeen-year-old eyes, that seemed so romantic.

867
3493
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:10,760
That's a famous scene. Lots of parodies were made of it, too.

868
3497
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,980
But . . .

869
3501
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:19,090
After I was over 20, I saw it again, and I noticed something different.

870
3505
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,430
What?

871
3509
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:26,100
The two's expressions afterward.

872
3513
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:34,200
After they fled excitedly from the wedding, they rode the bus.

873
3517
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:38,100
But strangely, the two have no words to say to each other.

874
3521
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:43,140
Feeling anxious and empty.

875
3525
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:46,080
I didn't notice that when I was young,

876
3529
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:51,320
but I started to notice that scene at some point.

877
3533
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,390
Why?

878
3537
01:07:57,390 --> 01:08:02,180
You see that scene between you and your landlord?

879
3541
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:12,440
Are you having a hard time?

880
3545
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:19,910
Yeah.

881
3549
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,150
Yup.

882
3553
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:40,730
Now?

883
3557
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:43,530
Alright.

884
3561
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,450
It's so cold.

885
3565
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:50,560
Hurry and go on.

886
3569
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:54,030
Nah. Why?

887
3573
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:57,330
Hurry and go. CEO Ma's waiting.

888
3577
01:08:57,330 --> 01:09:00,880
Then, call me after you've arrived. Okay?

889
3581
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:20,830
What happened? Are you alright? What happened?

890
3585
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:23,230
Did you do something to Deputy Park?

891
3589
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:27,490
Your way didn't work so this time, so this time, I did it my way.

892
3593
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:29,660
Your way, what?

893
3597
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,270
I punched him hard in his stupid mouth.

894
3601
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:35,270
What?

895
3605
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,870
<i>You did good. Good job! </i>

896
3609
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:38,540
<i>Come here!</i>

897
3613
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,200
<i>Hey!</i>

898
3617
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:49,350
<i>Ack.</i>

899
3621
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:52,700
<i>I only knew after love existed, </i>

900
3625
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,930
<i>the reason our marriage was easy </i>

901
3629
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:00,440
<i>was because there was no love. </i>

902
3633
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,580
<i>I'll pay for half of your wedding attire cost.</i>

903
3637
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,650
<i>No, it's alright. It's not that much anyway. </i>

904
3641
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:09,880
<i>But you had to pay for wedding shoes and the bouquet, unlike me.</i>

905
3645
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,400
<i>So I'll deduct them from next month's rent. </i>

906
3649
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,870
<i>Marriage is supposed to be done out of love.</i>

907
3653
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:19,040
<i>But why . . .</i>

908
3657
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,700
<i>Then what about kids? When will you have a baby then?</i>

909
3661
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:28,640
<i>After there is love, </i>

910
3665
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,360
<i>why is it that the wounds just get bigger?</i>

911
3669
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:43,250
Have you ever confessed to her?

912
3673
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:47,630
Do you know that words have to reach a person's heart in order to survive too?

913
3677
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:52,220
They need to come out of the mouth in order to reach the heart.

914
3681
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:55,910
Yeah, I know that too. It's very awkward.

915
3685
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,920
But more than I imagined,

916
3689
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,920
it suits you.

917
3693
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:08,300
Let's give it a

918
3697
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,380
good try today.

919
3701
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,580
You went to Soo Ji's?

920
3705
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:37,460
Yes. I had a can of beer.

921
3709
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,970
I see.

922
3713
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:59,170
Today, were you able to sign the contract okay?

923
3717
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:04,830
Yes. The CEO is really very nice.

924
3721
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:07,280
I see.

3725
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,520
That's a relief.

926
3729
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:16,500
You seem tired.

927
3733
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:22,900
A bit worn out, today.

928
3737
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:38,310
Hey, Kitty! You came out to greet us?

929
3741
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:45,070
I have something to tell you.

930
3745
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:50,760
Yes. I also have something to tell you too.

931
3749
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,760
Maybe this isn't very noticeable?

- Now—
 - We—

934
3762
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:31,830
Oh.

935
3766
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,440
You go first.

936
3770
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,590
Yes. So . . .

937
3774
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:41,580
Now, we . . .

938
3778
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:52,300
No. You go first.

939
3782
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,830
Now, we . . .

940
3786
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:02,890
Our contract.

941
3790
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:10,190
I'd like to end it.

957
3855
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:20,840
