00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,530
Hello.

163
654
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,590
I'm in charge of CEO Ma's company's finance. Shin Young Hyo.

164
658
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,420
Ah, yes.

165
662
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,170
I don't have a name card.

166
666
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,910
I will be going ahead, CEO.

167
670
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,810
Ah, right. Ms. Ho Rang.

168
674
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,600
I will call you. Take care.

169
678
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,190
Yes.

170
682
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,440
Yes.

171
686
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,430
I heard from CEO Ma that you are headed to Silimdong.

172
690
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,090
Yes.

173
694
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,290
I will give you a ride. The bus in this neighborhood comes really late.

174
698
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,410
No, it's okay. You don't have to.

175
702
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,300
I'm not a bad person. I have known CEO Ma for a long time.

176
706
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,710
You must live there?

177
710
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,100
No. Just...

178
714
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,890
I just need to get my things.

179
718
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,630
I see.

180
722
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,110
But then, Ms. Ho Rang, do you really not know who I am?

181
726
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,270
Pardon?

182
730
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,900
I want to get married.

183
734
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,460
Huh?

184
738
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,890
Gyeolmalrae! We chatted on it! After you accepted my 'like'.

185
742
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,190
Ahhh.

186
746
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,610
Honestly, I was really startled earlier.

187
750
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,530
I recognized you at first glance.

188
754
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,110
Yes.

189
758
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,610
After I installed that app, the first person I talked to was you.

190
762
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,330
But you haven't replied since then.

191
766
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,940
So I thought I was rejected.

192
770
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,520
That...

193
774
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,830
that time, I too just registered for the first time so I just replied without any thoughts.

194
778
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,840
Since it was CEO Ma's app.

195
782
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,760
Pardon?
- What's this?

196
787
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,380
Are you acknowledging the startling part?

197
791
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,370
For real, an irrefutable part?

198
795
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,260
Thank you for giving me a ride. Take care.

199
799
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,960
Yes--

200
803
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,280
Take care.

201
807
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,190
<i>Love forever. Seok. Rang. </i>

205
823
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,440
What you said was right.

206
827
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,780
Now, I... will be honest to my heart.

207
831
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,300
♫ <i>Forgotten it all</i> ♫

208
835
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:18,100
♫ <i>The past, written in fading </i> ♫

209
839
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,700
Why are you here? You didn't go?

210
843
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,450
No, since you said you were here to get your things and I thought maybe it would be heavy.

211
847
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,580
And I noticed you weren't in a good condition since earlier.

212
851
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,260
Pardon?

213
855
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,040
Give it to me. I will give you a ride.

214
859
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,570
No.

215
863
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,520
I would be too burdened if you do this.

216
867
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,990
At a glance it's obvious that you are about to get sick.

217
871
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,820
You've got a body flu, acknowledge to the left, acknowledge to the right, acknowledge to the front?

218
875
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,140
Pardon?

219
879
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,790
No, your face shows that you're in the nick of collapsing.

220
883
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,020
How could I pretend not to notice and just go?

221
887
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,970
Give it to me, Ms. Ho Rang.

222
891
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,530
Then, should I?

223
895
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:10,050

229
919
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,150
The lawsuit, we will proceed with it as we talked about.

230
923
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:44,700
In the process of investigation, you would have to personally be investigated.

231
927
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,470
Are you alright with that?

232
931
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,060
Yes.

233
935
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,440
I already know that.

234
939
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,610
Thankfully, you have the call and text records with that director

235
943
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,620
so it will help.

236
947
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,900
Just that, once their side starts playing with the media,

237
951
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,620
It will be noisy.

238
955
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,520
Especially since it's in the broadcast field to start.

239
959
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,200
Yes. Once it starts I should prepare myself.

240
963
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,600
Okay. Then we will proceed as is.

241
967
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,590
And also,

242
971
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,500
this is the contract.

243
975
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,900
There's no need for you to sign right away.

244
979
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,050
You can take it and look through it

245
983
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,640
and if you want any adjustments to be made you can just tell me.

246
987
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,820
But then...

247
991
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,850
the amount is...

248
995
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,450
Is more negotiation needed?

249
999
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,700
Ah, it's less than the amount you expected.

250
1003
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,890
No.

251
1007
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,620
I think it's too much.

252
1011
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,450
Writer, you can't be like that.

253
1015
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,060
Pardon?

254
1019
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,230
Even if you are surprised, you should go out and be surprised on your own.

255
1023
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,270
We are doing a contract, so how could you show what you feel in front of a contractor?

256
1027
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,440
CEO, you are not a contractor though.

257
1031
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,380
It's not a lot.

258
1035
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,150
Our company's standard, that is the starting for newbie writers.

259
1039
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,880
Honestly, our company doesn't sign contracts with writers that much.

260
1043
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,160
But if we do, we do it the right way.

261
1047
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,990
If we think it's a person we will be working for a long time with.

262
1051
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,610
CEO...

263
1055
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,050
Yes?

264
1059
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,760
Today...

265
1063
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,510
should we eat?

266
1067
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,860
Sure.

273
1095
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,180
Writer, did you cure your hangover this morning?

274
1099
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,910
I drank warm honey water before sleeping

275
1103
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,260
and it was okay.

276
1107
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,820
Ahhh... did you husband prepare it for you?

277
1111
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,030
Yes.

278
1115
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,690
My husband...

279
1119
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,200
prepared it for me.

280
1123
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,360
Before we sign a contract, I have something I am curious about.

281
1127
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,450
Yes, Writer?

282
1131
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,220
About the person you told be before.

283
1135
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,880
The one you almost married.

284
1139
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,770
Yes.

285
1143
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,900
If you were to meet him again,

286
1147
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,700
how do you think it would be?

287
1151
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,230
Even if you meet him again,

288
1155
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,330
do you think you will love him still?

289
1159
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,160
This...

290
1163
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,270
is this question related to the contract?

291
1167
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,390
Yes.

292
1171
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:24,620
It is an important question that is related to the contract.

293
1175
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,560
Honestly, I met him.

294
1179
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,700
That friend.

295
1183
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,430
The day when we went to your neighborhood

296
1187
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,250
that day...

297
1191
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,850
by coincidence.

298
1195
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,230
That's why right now, your question is a bit...

299
1199
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,380
all the more

300
1203
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,380
strange, I feel.

301
1207
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,010
That day too.

302
1211
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,090
He came to get me.

303
1215
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,770
Se Hee did.

304
1219
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,540
<i>The way I see it, you have never faced the world properly.</i>

305

<i>Using the company as an excuse and your mom as your shield.</i>

306

<i>face it head on.</i>

309
1239
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,440
<i>That's what I think.</i>

310
1243
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,850
<i>And when you start, I will be by your side to hang in there with you.</i>

311
1247
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,850
Okay. Work hard.

That... Chief Park.

313
1255
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,930
Would you want to smoke a cigarette with me?

314
1259
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,020
Right now?

315
1263
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,500
Yes.

316
1267
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,960
No. I'm okay.

317
1271
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,900
What do you want to say?

318
1275
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,690
It was 2015 when I came to this team

319
1279
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,520
and it's been three years that we are like this.

320
1283
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,860
If you calculate it by work days it would be 800 days.

321
1287
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,960
If you calculate it by time it's 7,200 hours.

322
1291
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,230
Is that so?

323
1295
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,520
But then, in that long time

324
1299
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,960
it was very horrible.

325
1303
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,100
Horrible?
- Yes.

326
1308
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:14,150
If it was a day where we would have a company dinner I would be pondering how should I smile.

327
1312
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:20,480
And if it's after my vacation, you would probably ask where I went with my boyfriend.

328
1316
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,640
Then what would I give as an answer?

329
1320
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,880
When I don't feel good, in case you would tell me it's that day,

330
1324
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,740
so I couldn't even act as if I was sick.

331
1328
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:36,420
If I think about you all that comes out is just horrible and painful memories.

332
1332
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,270
But you are still a colleague that I worked with for 7,200 hours

333
1336
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,560
isn't that so sad?

334
1340
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,330
Well... so what do you want to say?

335
1344
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,700
About all the hurt that I have received all this time

336
1348
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,660
I would want you to apologize.

337
1352
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,400
What?

338
1356
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,870
I need to receive an apology.

339
1360
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,060
From you.

340
1364
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:05,000
In a place where all the people from our team is present, apologize officially.

341
1368
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,890
Apologize?

342
1372
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:13,330
I really... want to end this horrible connection with you.

343
1376
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:18,340
Today, I gathered all my sincerity to talk to you, so

344
1380
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,240
you should show your sincerity too.

345
1384
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,240
Then, I will be waiting.

346
1388
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,890
Soo Ji, why? Did something happen?

347
1392
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,250
No.

348
1396
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,130
It's nice to see you.

349
1400
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,960
Why are you so cute?

350
1404
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,240
What you said was right.

351
1408
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,620
I just avoided it and cursed.

352
1412
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,290
I have never conversed with Chief Park while looking at each other.

353
1416
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:19,010
He is someone's son and a family's head of household though.

354
1420
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,280
My Soo Ji is really cool.

355
1424
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,590
This punk! Come here!

356
1428
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,440
What's wrong with you?

357
1432
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,760
Is this not it?

358
1436
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,550
No.

359
1440
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,450
So it's not.

360
1444
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,530
Go Jeong Min?

361
1448
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,700
<i>[Go Jeong Min]</i>

362
1452
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,180
Jeong Min?

363
1456
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,130
<i>[Go Jeong Min]</i>

364
1460
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:42,100
How in the world... could you meet like this?

365
1464
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,730
Sister-in-law... no...

366
1468
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,790
Does Ms. Ji Ho know?

367
1472
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,060
Well, how could she know.

368
1476
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,560
This unbelievable situation.

369
1480
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,880
So are they working together?

370
1484
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,690
Probably.

371
1488
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,930
Shouldn't you be the first one to talk about it?

372
1492
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,980
It's not even a work where you could bump into each other once in a while

373
1496
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,070
but if it's a production CEO and writer then they would have a lot of times to see each other.

374
1500
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,840
What...

375
1504
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,450
should I say?

376
1508
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:27,800
From where to where should I say?

377
1512
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,620
That she was someone I dated long ago.

378
1516
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,740
Whatever I say, she would get hurt.

379
1520
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,530
Because she is a transparent person.

380
1524
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,490
I don't want that.

381
1528
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,200
I didn't mean Ms. Ji Ho though.

382
1532
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,460
I was talking about Jeong Min.

383
1536
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,440
I was going to ask how you are going to explain Ji Ho to Jeong Min.

384
1540
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,240
You... it wasn't that you couldn't forget Jeong Min?

385
1544
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,320
Isn't that why you

386
1548
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,580
married with a contract?

387
1552
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,150
Anyway, Ms. Ji Ho

388
1556
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,520
would just be associated to you by contract

389
1560
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,920
so to you... wasn't she just a tenant?

390
1564
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,930
So you weren't worried about Jeong Min.

391
1568
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:05,460

<i>How are you?</i>

397
1592
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,600
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

398
1596
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,410

405
1624

406
1628
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,860
<i>That's what I though.</i>

407
1632

00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,460

1652

413
1656
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,180
<i>I thought.</i>

414
1660
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,020
Here he comes. Unit 402!

415
1664
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,120
What about Se Hee-nim?

416
1668
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,010
Ahhh, he left work ahead.

417
1672
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,710
Are you thinking of throwing out the company's program just because of your ex-girlfriend?

418
1676
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,830
Just after 2 weeks of employment?

419
1680
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,320
Pardon?

420
1684
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,300
Ahhh... I'm sorry.

421
1688
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,810
No.

422
1692
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,790
But how did you know?

423
1696
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:41,100
How could I not know? It's written all over your face.

424
1700
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,100
My face?

425
1704
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,640
As you date you could also break up.

426
1708
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,820
Why are you making it so obvious?

427
1712
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,410
It's not like it's your first time dating.

428
1716
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,190
I only dated once though.

429
1720
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,900
Ahhh... Is that so?

430
1724
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,180
Then,

431
1728
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,100
it must have been your first?

432
1732
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,370
What? What is first?

433
1736
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,700
What is what? I mean brokenhearted.

434
1740
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:26,370
You worked hard. Goodbye.

435
1744
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,270
<i>Ms. Ho Rang, you seem to be very busy.</i>

436
1748
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,630
<i>Did you go home safely that day?</i>

437
1752
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,560
<i>If you are not busy, how about dinner tonight?</i>

438
1756
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,290
Ms. Ho Rang!

439
1760
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:12,610
I'm not late, right? The moment you replied I started the engine.

440
1764
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,490
Yes.

441
1768
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,040
You must be hungry. What would you like to eat?

442
1772
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,490
Never mind food, how about a simple beer?

443
1776
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,000
Beer?

444
1780
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,870
That's also a part where I agree a lot.

445
1784
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,080
Let's go.

446
1788
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,920
Cheers.

447
1792
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:46,550
Wow. You must've been very thirsty...

448
1796
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,450
Did you go home safely that day?

449
1800
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:56,620
I had a boyfriend for 7 years.

450
1804
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,210
However, recently we broke up.

451
1808
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,160
To be honest, the day you took me back

452
1812
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:09,470
was to the house that we shared up until now.

453
1816
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,160
Ah..

454
1820
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,860
However...

455
1824
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,520
How could you not have that much belongings?

456
1828
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,460
What?

457
1832
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,560
It's understandable.

458
1836
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,390
Even if you date for a long time, when you break up, there isn't really much stuff to get rid of.

459
1840
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,760
Ah, I also dated my girlfriend for seven years.

460
1844
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,660
However,

461
1848
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,460
why did you two break up?

462
1852
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,730
We just fought a lot because of the topic of marriage.

463
1856
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:52,390
Plus, dating and marriage are very different.

464
1860
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,400
So how are you planning to overcome this situation?

465
1864
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,760
What?

466
1868
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,630
Your break up. Have you came up with a plan on how to overcome it?

467
1872
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,370
Well, I don't really have one as of now...

468
1876
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,260
Well, time is medicine.

469
1880
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,540
How can time be medicine?

470
1884
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,230
Time is just merely time.

471
1888
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,490
You can't get fooled by these type of things, Ho Rang.

472
1892
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:44,700
You see for a person, when they really want something, they have to say in order for it to happen.

473
1896
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:50,270
So every morning and night, I would say my wishes out loud looking at my reflection in the mirror.

474
1900
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,270
What did you say?

475
1904
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,750
"I can forget her. I can overcome this break up."

476
1908
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,930
Please don't say those type of four words idioms in front of me. I'm not that smart, so I don't understand that.

477
1912
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:15,890
Ah...those aren't four word idioms. These are abbreviations that a teenager uses.

478
1916
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,500
What?

479
1920
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,450
No...why do you say those type of things?

480
1924
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,770
It makes me feel better.

481
1928
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,050
It also makes me feel younger.

482
1932
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:49,010
Uhm...I've been here before.

483
1936
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,290
<i>Director Gye Yong Seok</i>

484
1940
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,130
<i>Some man told me this was for Unit 400 and left it here.</i>

485
1944
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,660
<i>Okay...</i>

486
1948
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,230
<i>Since you told me not to call you, I'm leaving this here.</i>

487
1952
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,340
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

488
1956
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,120
Yes.

489
1960
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,720
I know

490
1964
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,910
that you came before.

491
1968
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,410
I see...

492
1972
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:16,480
I didn't know she got married.

493
1976
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,970
I'm sorry.

494
1980
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:25,500
I just had a lot of drinks, so I don't really remember...

495
1984
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,130
I'm being serious. Please believe me.

496
1988
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:32,710
I will pay you back with as much settlement money you want...

497
1992
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,370
So you see...could you please take the complaint back?

498
1996
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,730
I also need to work on this new project.

499
2000
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,460
What?

500
2004
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,190
<i>I had a dream about me walking on /i></i>

501
2008
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:57,540
<i>an unending tunnel.</i>

502
2012
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,600
I...you see...

503
2016
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,660
I thought you knew about it...

504
2020
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,550
I think this is something you need to talk to her about.

505
2024
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,470
Then, sorry for bothering you.

506
2028
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,590
I'll talk to her.

507
2032
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,700
Sit down.

508
2036
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,850
Talk to me.

509
2040
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,680
Properly and everything.

510
2044
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,410
Thank you

511
2048
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,850
for telling me something that's hard to share with anyone.

512
2052
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,340
I also have something I'm curious about.

513
2056
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,520
and if my answer was yes,

514
2060
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,820
how would you react to that?

515
2064
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,060
If that did happened,

516
2068
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,780
I would probably ended up being your enemy.

517
2072
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,680
Then were we supposed to be fighting?

518
2076
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,400
Right here grabbing each other's hair?

519
2080
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,080
I would probably have waited

520
2084
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,120
for Se Hee's heart.

521
2088
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,330
You would've waited...

522
2092
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,540
Why? Is it because it's a contract marriage?

523
2096
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,240
Even if it was a real marriage,

524
2100
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,920
I would've done the same thing.

525
2104
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,690
Being a married couple doesn't mean

526
2108
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:01,680
you have all of each other's heart.

527
2112
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,690
Is that so?

528
2116
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:11,320
However, honestly isn't that why you get married to each other?

529
2120
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,600
Because it's almost an official document

530
2124
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,430
that shows that you have each other's heart.

531
2128
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:25,040
So even if you have a change of heart, the document makes it hard for them to leave.

532
2132
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,290
I'm not quite sure.

533
2136
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,120
Since this is my first time getting married

534
2140
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,180
and experiencing love.

535
2144
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,130
So there's a lot of things I don't know,

536
2148
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,820
but there's one thing I'm sure of.

537
2152
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,290
Having someone's heart isn't some game.

538
2156
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,320
It just comes to you.

539
2160
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:11,170
Please keep it a secret that I know about this now.

540
2164
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,350
<i>Be well.</i>

541
2168
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:41,460
<i>Go back and act like nothing ever happened</i>

542
2172
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,760
<i>Instead, don't ever love anyone.</i>

543
2176
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,190
<i>You have no rights to.</i>

544
2180
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,840
I know, right?

545
2184
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,900
Having someone's heart isn't some kind of game.

546
2188
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,650
She already knew that...

547
2192
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,100
I'm envy of you, Writer.

548
2196
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,790
Your phone call was long.

549
2200
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:22,190
Ah, yeah. It was the lawyer.

550
2204
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,490
There was a problem with Writer Yoon's lawsuit with that guy.

551
2208
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,760
What?

552
2212
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,990
What happened?

553
2216
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,940
About that...

554
2220
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,690
That guy must've came to find her to try to settle it,

555
2224
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:36,090
but he got punched badly.

556
2228
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,620
By who?

557
2232
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,330
Writer Yoon's husband.

558
2236
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,080
What?!

559
2240
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,700
He...

560
2244
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,750
hit a person?

561
2248
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,100
Hey, should we all have a drink? Take out your drink.

562
2252
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,390
You should take the lead, Deputy Park.

563
2256
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,060
Alright!

564
2260
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,490
I love you. You know that, right?

565
2264
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,020
Ah, that's right, the apology.

566
2268
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,500
I'm sorry, Deputy Woo.

567
2272
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,160
All together now. Team Leader,

568
2276
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,340
- I love you! 
- I love you!

569
2281
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,190
Did something happened between you two?

570
2285
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,010
No. Nothing happened. Drink.

571
2289
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,560
Okay, I'm leaving first.

572
2293
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,730
- Have a goodnight, CEO.
- Goodbye.

573
2298
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,910
- Goodbye.
- See you!

574
2303
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,890
How about we have a round 2, Deputy.

575
2307
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,390
Deal!

576
2311
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,700
Let's have some beef sashimi and afterward karaoke, deal?

577
2315
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,740
Karaoke, deal!

578
2319
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,500
I'm going to stop by the office really quick.

579
2323
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,420
Wait for me!

580
2327
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,340
- Okay!
- We'll wait for you there!

581
2332
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:37,620
<i>Yes, honey?</i>

582
2336
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,520
Language was made to be able to understand others, right?

583
2340
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,560
That's right.

584
2344
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,680
If words don't work for someone, they aren't human.

585
2348
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,150
Of course. If words don't work, then they aren't human.

586
2352
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:51,590
Either they are an animal, insect, or water flea. But why are you asking all of a sudden?

587
2356
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:57,590
Were you sincere when you said you'll stay by my side once I start?

588
2360
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,060
Of course, I was sincere.

589
2364
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,680
- Take your turn.
- Hurry and roll the dice, CEO.

590
2369
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,790
<i>CEO..</i>

591
2373
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,860
I love you.

592
2377
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,490
Hello? Hello, honey?

593
2381
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,160
What was that?

594
2385
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,260
- It's your turn, CEO.
- Hurry up.

595
2390
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,140
Is that Seoul?

596
2394
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,450
No way...

597
2398
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,650
No, no, no, no!

598
2402
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:44,190
What do you mean no? You have to buy Seoul now, CEO.

599
2406
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,460
That coward..seriously...

600
2410
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:12,120
<i>Deputy Woo should be shown full shot.</i>

601
2414
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,150
<i>B? B? No, no no.</i>

602
2418
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,990
<i>A full A. Full A.</i>

603
2422
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:20,300
<i>If only I wasn't married</i>

604
2426
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,620
<i>together with Deputy Woo... Huh?</i>

605
2430
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:40,660
Oh? Deputy Woo, why did you come?

606
2434
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,910
There's something I need to settle.

607
2438
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,460
Is that so?

608
2442
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,810
Jin Ho!

609
2446
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,300
What?

610
2450
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:14,400
Here it goes.

611
2454
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,030
Tak, tak, tak. Pak. I'm buying Taipei.

612
2458
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,970
I was going to buy that though.

613
2462
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:23,030
They say that a place where the tiger (horangi) is not around the rabbit plays king.

614
2466
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,980
What? Is this all Won Seok-nim's land?

615
2470
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,700
Yeah.
Woah. We really raised a baby tiger (horangi).

616
2475
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,170
That's why you should have bought it earlier.

617
2479
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:33,970
You need to get in the tiger's (horangi) den in order to catch the baby tiger (horangi).

618
2483
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,260
Let's stop this now.

619
2487
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,270
Why? It's getting fun.

620
2491
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:40,080
What's fun about it? We're not even kids. We just play this everyday.

621
2495
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,180
Let's go have a drink. My treat!

622
2499
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,370
Really?

623
2503
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,020
Your treat?

624
2507
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,240
Yes. I will treat everyone today. Let's go till the end today.

625
2511
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,510
Then I will be going first.

626
2515
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:51,690
No, Bo Mi-nim should come too.

627
2519
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,620
No thanks, I have an appointment today.

628
2523
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,120
At this time, what appointment?

629
2527
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,190
Should I call it an appointment with myself?

630
2531
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:01,060
Have fun. I will be going first.

631
2535
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,780
Ah! Today is Friday, right? Bo Mi-nim must be going to Itaewon again.

632
2539
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,690
Itaewon?

633
2543
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:10,350
There's a famous figure shop there.

634
2547
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:17,300
Ah. It does suit her well.

635
2551
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:22,230
Ah! Since you mention Itaewon, should we go to a club just us guys?

636
2555
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:24,670
C-club?

637
2559
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,800
Yeah. Club. What's the point of leaving our perfectly fine bodies?

638
2563
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,810
We should play hard while we're single, isn't it so?

639
2567
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,900
Oh, it seems like you go to clubs a lot.

640
2571
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,560
I haven't gone even once.

641
2575
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:59,760
I think my ears are going to bleed. 
- I didn't know it would be like this either.

642
2580
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,650
Ah! I think my eyes are going to bleed.

643
2584
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,390
Let's not stay here, let's go down there and have fun!

644
2588
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:18,620
No.

645
2592
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,760
You should go ahead.

646
2596
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,390
Then i will play downstairs so follow me later.

647
2600
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,250
Yes. Yes.

648
2604
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,410
Then I will be going down.

649
2608
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,260
Yes.

650
2612
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:37,630
Yang Ho Rang, I will forget you. Yang Ho Rang, I will forget you!

651
2616
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,650
I will forget you!

652
2620
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:37,120
Him? What's with him?

653
2624
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,870
Oh! Bo Mi-nim!

654
2628
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:42,290
Get down!

655
2632
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:44,500
Hey, I'm so scared.

656
2636
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,210
Then do you want to go to the internet cafe? Let's go!

657
2640
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,420
No...

658
2644
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:56,080
You said you had an appointment!

659
2648
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,820
On the stage, you talk with your body and not with your mouth.

660
2652
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,810
Body?

661
2656
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,930
<i>Mr. Se Hee</i>

662
2660
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:27,090
<i>Can you do me two favors?</i>

663
2664
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,040
<i>Ji Ho, later on</i>

664
2668
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,830
<i>when she says she wants to write</i>

665
2672
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:36,460
<i>can you allow her to do so?</i>

666
2676
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,940
<i>Even if it's later on, so that she can be able to write</i>

667
2680
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:45,250
<i>so she doesn't give up on her dreams.</i>

668
2684
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,960
<i>So that she doesn't live like her mom.</i>

669
2688
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,350
<i>Please do that.</i>

670
2692
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,330
<i>Hello.</i>

671
2696
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,010
Excuse me.

672
2700
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,870
Perhaps, do you have this book?

673
2704
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:00,430
Ah, the one that was here got sold today.

674
2708
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:03,860
Ah. Thank you.

675
2712
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,950
Yes.

676
2716
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:16,810
Hello, Father.

677
2720
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,660
A bit...

678
2724
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,370
you hit him a lot.

679
2728
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:33,240
Will it affect?

680
2732
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,390
Ji Ho.

681
2736
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:39,020
I think it will be okay.

682
2740
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,850
Just in time, I just met the CEO from that side.

683
2744
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:47,580
We know each other so he won't make things big.

684
2748
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,920
Okay. Thanks.

685
2752
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:56,560
That...

686
2756
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:01,030
me being Ji Ho's husband

687
2760
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,890
does that

688
2764
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:05,580
mean anything to you?

689
2768
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,090
And on Ji Ho's writing?

690
2772
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:12,960
Is that why you came to find me?

691
2776
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,740
Because of an old love

692
2780
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,120
I might ruin Writer's work?

693
2784
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,170
Or I will?

694
2788
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,720
Yeah.

695
2792
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:38,840
When I got married, there's a favor that Ji Ho's mother asked of me.

696
2796
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:43,570
When Ji Ho would want to write again

697
2800
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:47,140
she asked that I allow her to write again.

698
2804
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,000
So that she doesn't give up on her dreams

699
2808
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,980
she asked me to make her do so.

700
2812
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:02,020
But honestly, I don't know what to do really.

701
2816
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,540
I just promised that I won't be a hindrance.

702
2820
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:10,300
But then...

703
2824
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,850
you also know.

704
2828
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,340
The method for Ji Ho not to give up on her dream.

705
2832
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,920
So that is why you came to see me.

706
2836
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,070
To an old lover who you met after 12 years

707
2840
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,610
the words that you say...

708
2844
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,700
It's a bit... despicable.

709
2848
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,890
I'm sorry.

710
2852
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:50,640
But then... there was nothing that I could do.

711
2856
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,770
Why she decided to stop writing

712
2860
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:57,750
I only got to know today.

713
2864
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:01,440
The only thing that I could do was fligh a punch.

714
2868
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:06,230
I heard this was a good production company.

715
2872
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,680
Jeong Min...

716
2876
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,610
Not as my wife,

717
2880
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,980
but look at her as a writer

718
2884
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,680
I ask that of you.

719
2888
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:29,030
<i>Words are born from a person's mouth</i>

720
2892
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:32,100
<i>and dies in a person's ear.</i>

721
2896
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:44,720
<i>But some words, don't die</i>

722
2900
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:49,620
<i>and go in a person's heart</i>

723
2904
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,940
<i>and stay.</i>

724
2908
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,540
<i>The words that stayed in my heart for 12 years</i>

725
2912
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,020
<i>at some point</i>

726
2916
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,630
<i>could it have disappeared?</i>

727
2920
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,590
<i>I tried so hard</i>

728
2924
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,100
<i>those were the words</i>

729
2928
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,420
<i>that did not get erased.</i>

730
2932
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,260
I have something to ask too.

731
2936
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,530
You...

732
2940
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:25,550
have you confessed to her?

733
2944
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:30,730
What?

734
2948
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,520
Confession.

735
2952
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,900
"I like you" or

736
2956
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,140
well...

737
2960
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,750
A confession similar to that, have you tried?

738
2964
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:49,240
No. I just... thought do I have to use words...

739
2968
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,540
So you haven't.

740
2972
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,750
Do you know what?

741
2976
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,080
To me, you also

742
2980
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,770
never once did.

743
2984
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,250
Confess.

744
2988
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,330
I will be going.

745
2992
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,950
Okay.

746
2996
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,970
Words, too...

747
3000
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,160
have to get to a person's heart in order to live on.

748
3004
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:25,670
You have to get it out of your mouth so that it could go to a person's heart.

749
3008
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,690
<i>It was not a coincidence.</i>

750
3012
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,700
<i>So now . . .</i>

751
3016
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:39,160
<i>drawing a line on purpose.</i>

752
3020
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,110
<i>please don't.</i>

753
3024
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:44,970
<i>It was due to those words. </i>

754
3028
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,590
<i>It's no one's fault is what I think. </i>

755
3032
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,410
<i>Among them, some just flow by. </i>

756
3036
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:58,710
<i>While others break apart. </i>

757
3040
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,090
<i>It's just how it is. </i>

758
3044
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:11,300
<i>That person's warm words pile up and pile up more.</i>

759
3048
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,380
<i>You too, Se Hee.</i>

760
3052
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:16,700
<i>You shouldn't worry too much either.</i>

761
3056
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,800
<i>Just because you've lived yesterday,</i>

762
3060
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:25,470
<i>it doesn't mean you know</i>

763
3064
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:27,650
<i>all about today. </i>

764
3068
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:33,720
<i>In my dead heart's stead. </i>

765
3072
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,400
<i>She let it live on. </i>

766
3076
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,770
<i>Woori (we/us).</i>

767
3080
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:48,160
Are you still doing that part-time job?

768
3084
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,090
Oh, yes.

769
3088
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:53,790
But I think I might quit soon.

770
3092
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:57,380
Good. Good thinking.

771
3096
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,480
Yes.

772
3100
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,990
After I quit, I think I will start writing again.

773
3104
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,020
By writing, you mean, what?

774
3108
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:09,940
That drama?

775
3112
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,340
Yes.

776
3116
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:17,740
Didn't you say you quit that? To focus on homemaking?

777
3120
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,680
Yes, but

778
3124
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,400
a good opportunity came to me somehow.

779
3128
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,850
So I thought I might try to start again.

780
3132
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:28,920
What about kids then?

781
3136
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,020
What?

782
3140
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,600
When are you going to have a baby then?

783
3144
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,930
Oh.

784
3148
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:38,740
I haven't really . . .

785
3152
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:42,570
You should think about having babies. Even though work is important too.

786
3156
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:46,390
You're still young but Se Hee's got some age.

787
3160
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:58,750
Use that to pay off the loan and later on, when you've had a baby, you can use it to supplement the living costs.

788
3164
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,290
What?

789
3168
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:04,120
I promised I would do this once he got married.

790
3172
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:06,650
Oh.

791
3176
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:11,660
I don't think it's something for me to take.

792
3180
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,700
Then who should take it?

793
3184
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,380
Oh. Of course, you should give it to Se Hee directly.

794
3188
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,320
What would he and I meet and talk about?

795
3192
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,600
He wouldn't take it anyway if I gave it to him, so it's right for you to take it.

796
3196
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:29,490
The wife doing this stuff well in between is important too.

797
3200
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,990
Let's go now.

798
3204
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:35,140
Wait, Father-in-law.

799
3208
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:43,370
I have something to say to you.

800
3212
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:46,480
It's cold, so careful going back.

801
3216
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,520
Where are you? Why aren't you coming?

802
3220
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,660
Oh, I'll be back in a bit.

803
3224
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,900
What time is it! Hurry and come home!

804
3228
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:18,640
<i>Hey, am I a kid? Don't go over, triple, tuna board!</i>

805
3232
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:20,630
<i>See you later!</i>

806
3236
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:21,780
Over, triple?

807
3240
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,800
What tuna?

808
3244
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,680
At least it's good that she seems to be in a good mood.

809
3248
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:31,050
Tada.

810
3252
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,930
Soo Ji. You know the movie, "The Graduate," right?

811
3256
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:44,800
Of course. It's your favorite movie.

812
3260
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:48,100
I saw that over ten times.

813
3264
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,300
I saw it for the first time when I was first year in high school.

814
3268
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:55,690
When Benjamin barged into Elaine's wedding

815
3272
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:59,430
and grabbed her hand to come out. I fell for that scene.

816
3276
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:02,090
How should I say it?

817
3280
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:06,670
To my seventeen-year-old's eyes, that seemed so romantic.

818
3284
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:10,760
That's a famous scene. Lots of parodies were made on it.

819
3288
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,980
But . . .

820
3292
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:19,090
After I was over 20, I saw it again, and I noticed something different.

821
3296
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,430
What?

822
3300
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:26,100
The two's expressions afterwards.

823
3304
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:34,200
After the fled excitedly from the wedding, the rode the bux.

824
3308
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:38,100
But strangely the two have no words to say.

825
3312
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:43,140
Feeling anxious and empty.

826
3316
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:46,080
I didn't know when was young.

827
3320
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:51,320
But I started to notice that scene from I don't know when.

828
3324
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,390
Why?

829
3328
01:07:57,390 --> 01:08:02,180
You see that scene, between you and your landlord?

830
3332
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:12,440
It's hard?

831
3336
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:19,910
Yea.

832
3340
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,150
Yup.

833
3344
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:40,730
Now?

834
3348
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:43,530
Alright.

835
3352
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,450
It's so cold.

836
3356
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:50,560
Hurry and go on.

837
3360
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:54,030
Nah. Why?

838
3364
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:57,330
Hurry and go. CEO Ma's waiting.

839
3368
01:08:57,330 --> 01:09:00,880
Then, call me after you've arrived. Okay?

840
3372
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:20,830
What happened? Are you alright? What happened?

841
3376
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:23,230
Did you do something to Deputy Park?

842
3380
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:27,490
Your method didn't work so this time, I did it with my method.

843
3384
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:29,660
Your method, what?

844
3388
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,270
I shot him a punch.

845
3392
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:35,270
What?

846
3396
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,870
<i>You did good. Good job! </i>

847
3400
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:38,540
<i>Come here!</i>

848
3404
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,200
<i>Hey!</i>

849
3408
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:49,350
<i>Ack.</i>

850
3412
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:52,700
<i>I only knew after love existed. </i>

851
3416
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,930
<i>The reason our marriage was easy </i>

852
3420
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:00,440
<i>was because there was no love. </i>

853
3424
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,580
<i>I'll pay for half of your wedding attire cost.</i>

854
3428
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,650
<i>No, it's alright. It's not that much anyway. </i>

855
3432
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:09,880
<i>But you had to pay for wedding shoes and the bouquet, unlike me.</i>

856
3436
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,400
<i>So I'll deduct them from next month's rent. </i>

857
3440
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,870
<i>Marriage is supposed to be done out of love.</i>

858
3444
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:19,040
<i>But why . . .</i>

859
3448
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,700
<i>Then what about kids? When will you have a baby then?</i>

860
3452
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:28,640
<i>After there is love, </i>

861
3456
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,360
<i>why is it that the wounds just get bigger?</i>

862
3460
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:43,250
Have you ever confessed to her?

863
3464
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:47,630
Do you know that words have to reach a person's heart in order to survive too?

864
3468
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:52,220
They need to be spit out from the mouth in order to reach the heart.

865
3472
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:55,910
Yea, I know that too. It's very awkward.

866
3476
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,920
But more than I imagined,

867
3480
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,920
it suits you.

868
3484
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:08,300
Let's give it a

869
3488
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,380
good try today.

870
3492
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,580
You went to Soo Ji's?

871
3496
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:37,460
Yes. I had a can of beer.

872
3500
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,970
I see.

873
3504
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:59,170
Today, were you able to sign the contract okay?

874
3508
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:04,830
Yes. The CEO is really very nice.

875
3512
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:07,280
I see.

876
3516
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,520
That's a relief.

877
3520
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:16,500
You seem tired.

878
3524
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:22,900
A bit . . .  wore out, today.

879
3528
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:38,310
Hey, Kitty! You came out to greet us?

880
3532
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:45,070
I have something to tell you.

881
3536
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:50,760
Yes. I also have something to tell you too.

882
3540
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,760
Maybe this isn't very noticeable?
