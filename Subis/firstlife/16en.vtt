00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,050
Oh, Mom, why are you calling so late at night?

9
37
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,950
What?

10
41
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,810
Really?

11
45
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,940
Oh, you came. Good.

12
49
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,100
It's very cold out, huh? They've been in there for a long time.

13
53
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,320
I think they will come out soon.

14
57
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,150
Oh, goodness.

Aigoo...

17
69
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,080
So happy to meet you.

18
73
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,270
It is really so nice to meet you.

19
77
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,340
So it was you.

20
81
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,960
You worked hard to come here.

21
85
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,100
He's a son. Yes, a son.

22
89
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,240
Father, your eyes...

23
93
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,480
Why... ?

24
97
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,590
What is this?

25
101
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,630
Are you crying, Honey?

26
105
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,290
What are you saying?

27
109
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,510
Who is crying?

28
113
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,440
Such useless words...

29
117
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,470
My mom became a grandma.

30
121
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,870
Yes.

31
125
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,370
I became a grandma.

32
129
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,440
I think it is such a good thing.

33
133
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,800
Getting a new family member.

34
137
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,050
It is a good thing, of course.

35
141
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,090
It is the biggest gift in the world.

36
145
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,560
Mom,

37
149
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,970
I'm getting a divorce.

38
153
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:54,320
I think we took that gift too lightly,

39
157
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,020
both him and I.

40
161
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,200
Why won't you say anything?

41
165
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,140
Is there any need for me to say anything?

42
169
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,830
You never change your mind after you make a decision.

43
173
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,700
You have the hardest time before making a decision

44
177
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,140
and you also have the hardest time after making that decision.

45
181
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,570
So what would I have to say to you?

46
185
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,440
Mom.

47
189
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,540
Mom,

48
193
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,650
why didn't you divorce Dad, back then?

49
197
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,890
When I was 10 years old

50
201
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,400
you left Dad and moved to your parents' house,

51
205
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,400
taking us both with you.

52
209
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,050
You remember that?

53
213
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Your dad and me,

54
217
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,220
we got married despite fierce opposition from both our families. You didn't know that did you?

55
221
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,080
Like Romeo and Juliet.

56
225
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,070
What?

57
229
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,070
Really?

58
233
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,810
We were so passionate.

59
237
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:41,690
Your dad and me both, we threw fits saying we couldn't live without each other.

60
241
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,430
So after all that difficulty, we finally married.

61
245
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,190
But after living together for a while

62
249
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,470
I even thought about splitting up with him.

63
253
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,590
Then why didn't you do it?

64
257
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,090
I had decided to divorce him, then watched your father as he slept.

65
261
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,620
Then suddenly, the thoughts of our dating days kept coming to me.

66
265
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,680
"Oh, if I split up with him now,

67
269
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,830
I would live the rest of my life longing for him."

68
273
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,560
That I would keep him in a small corner in my heart

69
277
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,960
and intensely long for him, this man.

70
281
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,590
And once I had that thought

71
285
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,950
I just decided to live together with him, again.

72
289
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:43,520
Ji Ho, a person's life is all similar to most others.

73
293
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,590
It's all quite ordinary.

74
297
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,320
However, they just have to take good care

75
301
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,940
of their 'star pockets,' that is what is important.

76
305
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,390
Star pockets?

77
309
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,370
Even in an ordinary life

78
313
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,230
there are times when something sparkly floats by.

79
317
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:12,290
At those times, you have to not miss it,

80
321
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,190
and keep it carefully in your star pocket.

81
325
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,970
So when you are having a tough time later,

82
329
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,270
and when you are exhausted, you can take out and look at your stars

83
333
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,960
and endure the hard times.

84
337
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,180
So

85
341
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,880
because I don't want to miss my star

86
345
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,130
I am getting divorced.

87
349
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,060
In my star pocket, twinkle twinkle,

88
353
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,530
I want to fill it up.

89
357
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,370
You're talking crap.

90
361
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,810
You better not tell your dad, not a single word,

91
365
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,960
that you are divorcing.

92
369
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,330
He will shave your head bald, and you will be shoved into the newborns' room.

93
373
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,990
Then when do I tell him?

94
377
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,830
How is that my problem?

95
381
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,430
You figure it out.

96
385
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,630
You damned wench, you dare to speak of divorce?

97
389
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,160
<i>It hurt.</i>

98
393
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,260
<i>That family was a gift,</i>

99
397
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,230
<i>those beautiful words spoken by my mom</i>

100
401
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,020

101
405
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,030
<i>Marriage is</i>

102
409
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,220
<i>a sparking, shiny thing.</i>

103
413
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,100
Come on, Daddy.

104
417
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,140
Get up, let's go.

105
421
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,820
- Oh, you're here?
 - Get up now.
 - Hold on.

106
427
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,990
What are you doing?

<i>Marriage is...</i>

108
435
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,050
I told you to sleep in the car.

109
439
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,690
<i>even if you hate him, just once more</i>

110
443
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,140
<i>turning around to look back at him.</i>

111
447
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,220
<i>We, who thought of marriage too lightly...</i>

112
451
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,330
<i>we...</i>

113
455
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,930
<i>... we felt shame, for the first time.</i>

114
459
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,960
Shall we shake once?

115
463
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,180
I wish you luck.

116
467
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,220
For both of us

117
471
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,160
divorce is the first time.

118
475
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,550
Yes.

119
479
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,690
I wish you luck as well.

120
483
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,070
Ji Ho.

121
487
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,170
<i>Our relationship, which began with a handshake,</i>

122
491
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:59,790
<i>it was right to end it with a handshake, i thoought.</i>

123
495
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,960
<i>Our first half was marriage</i>

124
499

126
507
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,550
Thank you.

127
511
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,390
Deputy Park.

128
515
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,540
Whoa, CEO Ma. It's been a while.

129
519
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,750
Have you been well?

130
523
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,860
Of course.

131
527
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,190
What happened to your nose?

132
531
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,540
Oh, this? I was drunk and fell down on my way home.

133
535
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,590
Aigoo.

134
539
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,580
Oh, the elevator is here. Let's go.

135
543
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,250
Oh, that's right. I heard you got funding.

136
547
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,020
Oh, congratulations, CEO Ma.

137
551
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,750
Oh, yes, thank you.

138
555
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,140
I don't see Deputy Woo.

139
559
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,630
- Deputy Woo?
 - Yes.

140
564
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,360
She left the company. Didn't you know?

141
568
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,600
Ah, I see.

142
572
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,160
Yes. This is why I hate working with women.

143
576
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,220
They just work briefly before they get married.

144
580
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,810
Would they understand the responsibilities of being a head of a family?

145
584
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,480
So cold...

146
588
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,100
Deputy Park, it's been such a long time. How about having a smoke with me?

147
592
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,790
Shall I? You guys go ahead, I'll be there soon.

148
596
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,800
You're not smoking?

149
600
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,600
Yes, I quit.

150
604
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,440
Smoking never really suited me.

151
608
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,160
Oh, is that right?

152
612
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,340
But if you don't smoke, your social life will be disadvantaged.

153
616
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,820
You won't have as much chance to have conversations.

154
620
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,430
What sort of conversations? What disadvantage?

155
624
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:11,950
You mean not being able to join in silly conversations men have while smoking with each other? Is that what you mean?

156
628
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,290
I know about that. Pretending to be a strong, alpha male

157
632
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,700
and it makes you feel like you are strong, and as if your existence is being validated.

158
636
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,650
But shouldn't that end when you're in 8th grade?

159
640
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,010
No, 8th graders these days don't engage in such silliness.

160
644
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,420
The kids are so smart these days

161
648
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,020
they understand well what shabby behavior is.

162
652
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,300
What the heck are you talking about?

163
656
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,460
What's up!  [English]

164
660
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,520
This is my girlfriend. Want to say hi?

165
664
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,240
♫<i>This is for all the bad girls around the world.</i>♫

166
668
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
♫<i>Not bad meaning "bad" but bad meaning "good," you know?</i>♫

167
672
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,730
You are out here early.

168
676
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,960
Yeah.

169
680
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,580
I was having some deep conversation with Jin Ho here.

170
684
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,980
Isn't that right?

171
688
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,840
Oh yeah?

172
692
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,060
It's been a while, Jin Ho.

173
696
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,850
You got fatter.

174
700
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,080
No, he lost some weight, actually.

175
704
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,210
Jin Ho, I am 3 years older than you.

176
708
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,250
Be well, and see you around.

177
712
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,080
We're going.

178
716
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,820
Bye.

179
720
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,460
So these are all no-wire bras, right?

180
724
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,030
Yes, they are all push-up mold.

181
728
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,500
Can I have a fitting for these?

182
732
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,630
Yes, of course. This way, please.

183
736
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,500
Yes.

184
740
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,470
Work hard.

185
744
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,550
Oh, you're working so hard when it's so cold today. My name is Ma Sang Goo.

186
748
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,530
It's nice to meet you.

187
752
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:00,410
Wow, you've worked out a lot. Fighting!

188
756
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:10,010
Oh, the sample studying is finally over. You've worked hard.

189
760
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,620
But there is still so much to do.

190
764
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,180
I have to prepare the online homepage.

191
768
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,430
I also have to look at the sample fabrics with the designer.

192
772
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,680
Take care.

193
776
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,470
Okay, you've worked hard.

194
780
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,870
Oh, and make sure you don't skip meals.

195
784
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,640
Freelancers work on the fuel of food, you know.

196
788
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,670
Oi!

197
792
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,540
Oppa.

198
796
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,110
What?

199
800
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,100
Want to come up and have ramyun?

200
804
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,200
Oh, oh!

201
808
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,840
I am no longer someone who is so easily fooled.

202
812
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,390
Really?

203
816
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,010
Yes. Come on.

204
820
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,760
Awesome!

205
824
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,420
Ahhh!

206
828
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,070
There still isn't anyone who came to see this room.

207
832
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,020
When someone rents it, I will contact you right away.

208
836
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,130
Yes, Ahjumma.

209
840
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:22,330
Aigoo, what happened to you these past few months, that your face looks so terrible?

210
844
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:26,760
Go back home, eat your mom's homecooking, and look pretty again, okay?

211
848
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,710
I'll be going.

212
852
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,960
Yes, see you.

213
856
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,910
Goodbye.

214
860
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,940
So you lived here for about three years, right?

215
864
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,140
Yes.

216
868
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,760
Goodness, you kept the place so neat.

217
872
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,480
You will not find a better two-room place. Come this way.

218
876
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,040
Oh.

219
880
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,640
This smaller room, you can use as a closet, and later, you can make it the child's room.

220
884
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,210
This is quite a pleasant room. Nice big window, and you can get fresh air.

221
888
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,280
That's right, you won't find a better place. Take a look at this now.

222
892
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,320
Honey.

223
896
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,410
Oh, I'm coming.

224
900
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,340
We enjoyed seeing your place.

225
904
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,330
Thank you, I'll be in touch.

272
1092
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,360
What is going on? Asking to eat with me, of all people.

273
1096
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,920
You and me are the only ones

274
1100
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,060
who are taking a day off from work.

275
1104
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,170
Oh, I see.

276
1108
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,070
But I heard that you don't like to eat out.

277
1112
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,630
I don't want

278
1116
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,290
to eat at home,

279
1120
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,050
alone.

280
1124
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,700
Yes, affection borne of food is a very scary thing.

281
1128
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,170
Ah, I heard that you put your home up for sale.

282
1132
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,450
Yes. I think

283
1136
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,460
the transaction will be complete soon.

284
1140
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,600
Where do you plan to move to?

285
1144
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,450
Did you find another place?

286
1148
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,540
Well,

287
1152
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,210
I'm sure there's a room somewhere. As long as it is not that house

288
1156
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,460
I don't care

289
1160
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,320
where it is.

290
1164
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,110
Oh, that isn't cooked yet.

291
1168
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,360
Who cares?

292
1172
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,970
As long as it fills my belly.

293
1176
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,900
But where did Ji Ho go travelling to?

294
1180
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,530
<i>Um,</i>

295
1184
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:01,690
<i>are you going somewhere far away?</i>

296
1188
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,010
<i>I think</i>

297
1192
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,750
<i>I probably will.</i>

298
1196
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,110
So did she really go somewhere very far?

299
1200
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,600
Yes.

300
1204
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,220
I think she went to Mongolia.

301
1208
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,550
Mongolia?

302
1212
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:27,420
Wow, you are intense, Yoon Ji Ho. You went to Mongolia?

303
1216
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,610
Here. Right here.

304
1220
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,210
Will you be all right?

305
1224
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,490
Of course, don't you know my head? Come on! Come on!

306
1228
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,300
I will really slam it hard.

307
1232
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,200
Come at me already.

308
1236
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,850
I am really gonna do it.

309
1240
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,560
Come on!

310
1244
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,300
Oh, that really hurt.

311
1248
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,290
It's been a long time since we hung out like this, huh?

312
1252
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,620
I know, I'm happy too.

313
1256
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,640
But you said you were going on a trip. Can you really play with me like this every day?

314
1260
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,490
It's been so long, you should at least go to Jejudo or something.

315
1264
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,260
Hey, I'm a girl from the ocean.

316
1268
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,940
You want me to take a trip to see the ocean?

317
1272
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,090
Yeah, what's so great about taking a trip, anyway? As long as you are happy and content, right?

318
1276
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,750
How is the guest house? Not uncomfortable?

319
1280
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,540
Yeah, it's fun.

320
1284
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:50,180
I have many foreign friends, and although the room is cold, so I can't sleep well sometimes,

321
1288
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:55,010
it's fine. It kind of feels like a trip, so it's nice.

322
1292
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,850
Ji Ho.

323
1296
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:04,290
Until you get your own place, do you want to live at my old rooftop apartment?

324
1300
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,530
There...

325
1304
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,360
Won Seok moved out. He's going to move in with his parents.

326
1308
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,520
That's good. He probably won't cook much for himself anyway.

327
1312
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,280
There is still a lot of time left in the lease, and I don't need the security deposit right away.

328
1316
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,980
So if you're okay, you can live there for a while.

329
1320
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,810
Let's have ramyun!

330
1324
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,190
Yes, yes, yes!

331
1328
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,670
Ta-da!

332
1332
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,530
That I would get to eat ramyun that Woo Soo Ji made for me,

333
1336
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:05,130
I feel like I have succeeded at life. Thank you. I will enjoy it.

334
1340
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,290
Is it good?

335
1344
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:28,150
It is so good. It is astounding.

336
1348
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,360
Ah, kimchi.

337
1352
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,450
Why is the ramyun raw?

338
1356
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,320
It's hard to make bad ramyun.

339
1360
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,010
Try eating it with this, it will taste good.

340
1364
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,820
What's this?

341
1368
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,160
Wow, even kimchi!

342
1372
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:01,400
Ah, you said Se Hee put his place up for sale? Where is he going to live?

343
1376
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,650
I don't know either. Even I haven't seen Se Hee in a while.

344
1380
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,850
He's using the days off he's accrued. I think he's going to use all 20 days at once.

345
1384
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:15,070
The whole company is on the verge of death thanks to Nam Se Hee.

346
1388
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,330
What the heck is he doing, anyway?

347
1392
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,610
Eat up, quickly.

348
1396
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,580
You try it too.

349
1400
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,200
No, you eat it.

350
1404
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,870
- Oh, it's tasty! 
 - Isn't it?

351
1409
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,950
It's breaking off.

352
1413
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,600
<i>- It's going in! 
 - Score! 
 - Sanchez makes the goal! </i>

353
1419
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,990
Sanchez scored a goal again…

354
1423
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,540
Wow, he sure scores often.

355
1427
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,850
<i> Sanchez made a perfect goal. </i>

356
1431
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:51,520
Woori. Did you put that collar on yourself?

357
1435
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:57,270
Or did your noona put it on you?

358
1439
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,200
Your noona, she was going to leave us.

359
1443
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,650
So why did she bother putting that on you, anyway?

360
1447
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,310
What was her reason, did she tell you?

361
1451
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,030
Do you know what's going on in your noona's heart?

362
1455
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,480
- Hey!
-Hey!

363
1460
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,160
- Hello.
- Oh, hello!

364
1465
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,580
<i> Arsenal makes a long pass to the left. </i>

365
1469
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,130
Hi, Ji Ho.

366
1473
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,500
Oh, hi Nancy!

367
1477
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,330
- You're watching soccer today again? 
- Yes.

368
1482
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,840
- Yes.

369
1486
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,230
It's important game.

370
1490
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:07,190
But why do you like watching soccer so much? Isn't it a bit boring to just watch?

371
1494
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,700
Boring?

372
1498
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,500
No.

373
1502
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,050
Ah, so…

374
1506
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,880
"It's not important just to watch."

375
1510
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,330
No wait. I need to use a relative pronoun, don't I?

376
1514
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,400
"What you are..." No, that's not right. So what I mean is,

377
1518
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,890
With soccer, it's not watching that's important…

378
1522
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,380
It's who you watch it with that's important.

379
1526
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,820
<i>Goal!</i>

380
1530
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,810
<i>Oh, daebak!</i>

381
1534
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,610
Depending on who you're watching it with

382
1538
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,460
that day's match becomes memorable.

383
1542
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,890
I totally have no idea what you're talking about.

384
1546
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,910
I know.

385
1550
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,490
This is the negative result of high school English in Korea.

386
1554
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,200
How nice would it be if you learned some Korean?

387
1558
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,430
Anyway, what are you doing tomorrow?

388
1562
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,480
<i>[English] Tomorrow? I will make cake.</i> [In Korean] I'm going to make a cake.

389
1566
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,520
To who?

390
1570
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,660
Hmm, to my ex-husband.

391
1574
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,960
Pardon?

392
1578
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,320
Goodnight, Nancy.

393
1582
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,460
I'm going to sleep.

394
1586
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,170
Then let's begin withe the dough.

395
1590
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,840
Let's put our hearts into it, for the person we want to give this gift to.

396
1594
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,920
Thanks, memory, or perhaps a confession of love. Oh!

397
1598
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,010
Wow, it's so pretty!

398
1602
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,350
You did a great job making a raccoon.

399
1606
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,940
So pretty.

400
1610
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,060
If you lose here, you will treat all of us tomorrow. No backsies!

401
1614
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,750
- Call.
 - Call.
 - Fighting!

402
1620
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,670
Won Seok-nim, you are ready, right?

403
1624
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,830
Three! Two! One!

404
1628
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,460
Start!

405
1632
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,770
Move. Move. Why are you there?!

406
1636
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,760
You really suck at this game.

407
1640
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,520
- What did you say?
 - Left, go left.

408
1645
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,110
Step on it!

409
1649
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,950
<i> The game clip has been recorded. </i>

410
1653
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,420
Oh! Nam Soft!

411
1657
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,290
- Hello.
 - Hello.

412
1662
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,630
It's quite small, won't you be uncomfortable?

413
1666
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,960
All I need to do in my house is eat and sleep.

414
1670
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,410
What is there to be uncomfortable about?

415
1674
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,170
It's not as if I can take it with me when I die.

416
1678
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:45,800
You're not intending to quit your job at this company, are you?

417
1682
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,810
I still have more paid leave left.

418
1686
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,280
So I won't quit, yet.

419
1690
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:19,850
What is this?

420
1694
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,490
This room layout that feels weirdly familiar?

421
1698
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,630
Oh, Won Seok left some of this things behind.

422
1702
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,810
What is this?

423
1706
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,340
Why is this so comfortable?

424
1710
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,720
Like it's my own bed?

425
1714
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,520
<i>Rang, I moved into the rooftop apartment.</i>

426
1718
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,430
<i>Thank you.</i>

427
1722
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,170
Thank you.

428
1726
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,420
Ho Rang, I saw the calendar

429
1730
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,060
and next year's Independence Movement Day (March 1) is a Thursday.

430
1734
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,830
So if I get days off on Friday and the Tuesday after,

431
1738
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,190
I think a trip to Bali will be good.

432
1742
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,620
Ah, so you're going to Bali?

433
1746
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,120
Yes, it's perfect for a honeymoon.

434
1750
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,640
Ho Rang, go to Bali with me next year.

435
1754
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:43,340
<i>Won Seok-nim, thank you.</i>

436
1758
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,410
<i>I will take care of your place and move out later.
 - Looks like he's moved in.</i>

437
1763
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,260
Aren't you leaving work?

438
1767
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,290
I will, soon.

439
1771
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,990
The game that you play earlier,

440
1775
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,900
turn it on.

441
1779
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,320
<i>Race Event Start</i>

442
1783
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,420
It's on.

443
1787
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,310
Look at this.

444
1791
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:18,420
Your start is fast, but you let your opponent mess with your mind,

445
1795
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,090
and you end up failling behind.

446
1799
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,090
- Do you see it?
- Yeah..

447
1804
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:28,160
It better to just let the opponent pass you in the beginning and use a last minute spurt to pass them.

448
1808
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,100
That's true, I could do that.

449
1812
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,350
As expected, using your data analyst skills.

450
1816
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,630
My favorite thing is talking about are games, formulas,

451
1820
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,520
and game formulas.

452
1824
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,530
Really? I'm also like that.

453
1828
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,250
So, I was thinking..

454
1832
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,300
Yeah?

455
1836
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,730
If you have time,

456
1840
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,420
Yes?

457
1844
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,770
will you go out with me?

458
1848
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,700
Yes.

459
1852
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,590
Yes. Yes?!

460
1856
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,210
You did well.

461
1860
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,580
Who are you?

462
1864
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,080
Huh?

463
1868
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,590
That's the question I want to ask you...

464
1872
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,990
Who are you?

465
1876
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,060
Ah, I just moved in here. This is my home now.

466
1880
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,570
Huh?

467
1884
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,310
So he sold his place?

482
1944

To make this day our Day One, I wanted to confess to you first.

483

00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,880
Looks like the time has past already.

484

Woori,

485
1956
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,980
he won't even answer the phone.

486
1960

Where is he? This man?

<i>No, not today...</i>

494
1992
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,120
<i>To be honest, I hated him a little, too.</i>

495
1996
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,300
<i>Marriage that people enter into because of love must be happy, right?</i>

496
2000
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,090
<i>And I hurt a lot, too.</i>

497
2004
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,920

501
2020
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,020
<i>... did it exist for us, at all?</i>

502
2024
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,470
<i>I was curious.</i>

503
2028

<i>No, to be honest,</i>

504
2032
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,720

<i>But when I looked back, what remained in my heart</i>

<i>Just missing him.</i>

509

My star pocket is so full now,

510
2056
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,740

Hmm, Ji Ho.

Ji Ho. I heard you went to the rooftop apartment?

513
2068
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,440

531
2140
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,280
I dreamt of Ji Ho's bag before,

532
2144
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,960
and now my Ji Ho came into my dream.

533
2148
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:31,290
You must have missed me a lot.

534
2152
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,440
That I would appear in your dream.

535
2156
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,010
Now you even talk.

536
2160
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,510
Did you have a nice trip to Mongolia?

537

Mongolia?

538
2168
00:44:54,850 --> 00:45:00,750
Mongolia. Did you enjoy it there, while leaving here behind here?

539
2172
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,630
Did you have fun, while leaving me here, alone?

540

No.

541
2180
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,960
It was no fun at all.

542
2184

Because I missed you so much.

543
2188

I longed for you every day.

544

00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,000
The citrus tea.

570
2296
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:53,270
It looks like I am suffering from alcohol-induced dementia, after all.

2324
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,190
Huh?

578
2328
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:07,060
Can you really swallow that marinaded crab right now?

579
2332
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,720
Why not? Oh, is it too heavy for breakfast?

580
2336
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,020
Marinaded crab?

581
2340
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,510
That's not what I mean, obviously.

582
2344
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,490
Then what is it?

583
2348
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:21,690
Why can't I swallow marinaded crab?

584
2352
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:26,440
Didn't we get divorced?

585
2356
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:35,690
This situation is quite strange.

586
2360
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:38,800
We divorced, and you disappeared, saying you are going to Mongolia.

587
2364
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,340
And then you appear like this suddenly,

588
2368
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,870
and eating marinaded crab.

589
2372

This situation is quite complicated for me.

590

Then shall I

All right.

593
2388
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,790
I'll go, then.

594
2392

You know that is not what I mean. (casual speech to her for the first time)

00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,230
You're really not mad?

Yes, I am not angry.

603
2428

No, you are angry.

604
2432
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,640
I am not angry, I said.

605
2436
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:13,820
Insa-dong? How can you not contact me, even once?

606
2440
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:17,140
You were so nearby, and you never came to see me, even once?

607

00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,600
I missed you so much.

608
2448
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,920
I suffered... so much.

609
2452
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:32,840
You're smiling?

610
2456
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:37,200
Why are you smiling? After driving someone crazy

611
2460
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,670
and you even made me sell my house, and you can smile right now?

612
2464
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:49,190
Se Hee got angry.

613
2468
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:59,350
For the first time, you said these things to me.

614
2472

"I missed you so much."

615
2476

"I suffered so much."

616
2480
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,660
You told me how you felt

617

618

Thank you for opening your Room 19.

00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,800
I don't know.

623
2508
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,500
What do you mean? I'll give you a hug.

624
2512
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,930
Stop it, what are you doing?

625
2516
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,790
- Why not? Let's have a hug.
 - No, go away.

626
2521
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:00,080
- Oh, come on, come here.
 - Oh really...

627
2526
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:07,060
I told you to not come closer, didn't I?

628
2530
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:14,840
Do you need to eat more breakfast?

629
2534
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:22,230
I don't need to eat more breakfast.

630
2538
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:29,060
♫ <i> Even if I don't want to love  </i> ♫

631
2542
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,270
♫ <i> When you are before me  </i> ♫

632
2546
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:37,590
♫ <i> I want to hold your hand. Anything is good. </i> ♫

633
2550
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:42,060
♫ <i> I want to love. </i> ♫

634
2554
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:47,540
♫ <i> I want to love </i> ♫

635
2558
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,570
<i>You know that a perfect match such as this is not easy to find, right?</i>

636
2562
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,740
<i>I will wait for your wise decision.</i>

637
2566
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:32,040
Did you make up your mind?

638
2570
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,470
Yeah.

639
2574
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:37,000
Bo Mi-nim.

640
2578
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:43,060
You are like a Mac OS to me.

641
2582
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:49,530
New, fascinating, and user-friendly, so you're comfortable. That is how you are like, to me.

642
2586
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,360
However,

643
2590
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:56,910
even though things can be difficult and annoying,

644
2594
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:59,490
I would still prefer Windows.

645
2598
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:09,750
My head knows that the Mac OS would be the best for me,

646
2602
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:14,180
but even though I know that, my heart and soul

647
2606
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,470
still remembers Windows.

648
2610
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,730
I'm sorry, Bo Mi-nim.

649
2614
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:25,970
Okay. I get it.

650
2618
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,780
Of all the rejections I've heard, this is the most romantic.

651
2622
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,710
Ah, is that so?

652
2626
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,530
Thank you.

653
2630
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:43,880
However, how long are you planning to be with that old-fashioned computer?

654
2634
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,350
Shouldn't you also update your Windows?

655
2638
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:52,390
I heard that Mr. Accountant will propose tomorrow.

656
2642
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:58,720
So please "update" before you get "formatted."

657
2646
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,800
So you knew about this already, Bomi-nim?

658
2650
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,390
<i> From today on, today's our day 1!</i>

659
2654
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,330
Se Hee,

660
2658
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,470
Se Hee?

661
2662
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,580
Get up already.

662
2666
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,840
We should eat dinner.

663
2670
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,680
Can't we sleep just a little more?

664
2674
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:29,440
These days I haven't been sleeping well.

665
2678
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:38,530
But still, eat dinner and then sleep again, okay?

666
2682
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:49,450
Shall I make omurice for you again?

667
2686
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,820
Let's order chicken.

668
2690
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,520
It's nice.

669
2694
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,430
Yeah, very.

670
2698
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:22,530
I heard you didn't sign the contract

671
2702
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:25,240
from CEO Go.

672
2706
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,270
Yeah.

673
2710
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:34,530
I was wondering if you rejected a good contract because of me...

674
2714
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:38,260
Why does everyone think that

675
2718
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:42,630
because of them, I decided to give up something?

676
2722
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,990
CEO also thought that...

677
2726
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:50,540
I don't give up that easily

678
2730
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,840
since I am an unlucky kid born in 1988.

679
2734
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:59,550
Chances are precious and hard to get,

680
2738
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:02,920
so I do not give up anything that easily.

681
2742
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:10,830
Of all those chances, there is also love.

682
2746
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:20,050
Both CEO and your dad helped me

683
2750
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,020
realize what I can't give up on.

684
2754
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,560
I just couldn't give up on love.

685
2758
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:33,630
So, rather than me giving up this chance,

686
2762
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:38,480
I chose love as my priority.

687
2766
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:44,000
Experiencing what real love is,

688
2770
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,070
in this era that I live in,

689
2774
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:54,280
it's very difficult to do it properly, even once.

690
2778
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:03,510
Therefore, if marriage will harm our love,

691
2782
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:07,500
then I do not plan to make that choice again.

692
2786
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,340
What do you think, Se Hee?

693
2790
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,410
I...

694
2794
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:21,170
don't want to be separated from you ever again.

695
2798
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,990
Also, I want to be your

696
2802
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,180
legal guardian.

697
2806
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:33,160
So if anything dangerous were to happen,

698
2810
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,900
I can be the first one to run to you.

699
2814
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:45,410
However, that marriage is an institution that can change love,

700
2818
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,530
I agree with that, in general.

701
2822
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:50,620
The traditions and rules set by our parents' generation,

702
2826
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:56,060
I no longer want them to harm our feelings in the future.

703
2830
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:02,950
From now on, let's you and I together

704
2834
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,230
find an alternative that works for us.

705
2838
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,380
Okay.

706
2842
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:25,220
But wait. Did you and CEO Go meet with each other, alone?

707
2846
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,320
When? Where?

708
2850
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,570
Uhm...you see...about that...

709
2854
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:36,450
I got a call from her first.

710
2858
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:39,190
- She called you first?
 - Yes.

711
2863
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:44,130
But that CEO is a bit strange..how can she just call someone else's man out of the blue like that?

712
2867
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:47,360
I-I know, right?

713
2871
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,600
Should I change it? My phone number?

714
2875
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,700
No thanks.

715
2879
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:02,330
The chicken is getting cold.

716
2883
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,470
Yeah, Ji Ho?

717
2887
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,810
District office? Why are you going there?

718
2891
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:12,420
I think I should throw away that sofa.

719
2895
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,420
The landlord lady gave me a call.

720
2899
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:20,070
You're right...Wow, there's a lot of mold on the sofa.

721
2903
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,720
It also has a bunch of scratches here and there, too.

722
2907
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,650
Right?

723
2911
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:28,250
I'll go report it as bulk waste and then come get it later.

724
2915
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,070
Okay, I'll see you later.

725
2919
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:31,760
Okay.

726
2923
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,400
<i>I heard from the attorney.</i>

727
2927
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,230
<i>Congratulations on taking your first step as a 'striker.'</i>

728
2931
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:44,050
<i>Also, you will be getting a call from another production company soon.</i>

729
2935
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:48,200
<i>With a pure fan's heart, I promoted your work.</i>

730
2939
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,440
<i>Please write what is in your heart, Writer.</i>

731
2943
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,800
<i>My Man ♥ </i>

732
2947
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,260
- It's been a while, CEO Ma.
- Yeah..

733
2952
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,820
Oh?! Just who do we have here?

734
2956
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:15,760
The Nam Se Hee, who is finally coming to work after such a long time?

735
2960
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,230
I thought that you had left this company, so I was planning to get rid of this desk.

736
2964
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:23,150
However everyone, Nam Se Hee finally came to work on his own two feet.

737
2968
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:27,400
I missed your

738
2972
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,230
gags, CEO Ma.

739
2976
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,880
<i>Mine ♥</i>

740
2980
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:38,020
Mine? Hey, your phone must've been switched with someone else's on the bus.

741
2984
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,540
- Yeah?
- "Yeah?"

742
2989
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,810
- <i>Did you get to work okay?</i>
 - Yeah.

743
2994
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,320
I did.

744
2998
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,320
Are you going to perhaps be late later?

745
3002
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,120
<i>I have to help Ho Rang throw away her sofa,</i>

746
3006
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,950
<i>but it's not something we two can do alone.</i>

747
3010
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:52,580
Ah...

748
3014
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:56,000
Just leave it. I'll take care of it.

749
3018
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,510
Is that so?

750
3022
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,260
Me too.

751
3026
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:15,790
Did you unplug this?

752
3030
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:18,370
So I prepared this...
<i>Marriage Proposal Project</i>

753
3035
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:22,700
I'm also planning on buying a house together on our 4th year anniversary.

754
3039
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:27,320
Marriage is life's biggest project, after all.

755
3043
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,370
So in order to not fail,

756
3047
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:34,980
we have to slowly prepare ourselves, step by step.

757
3051
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:44,210
Yeong Hyo...I'm sorry.

758
3055
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:49,720
I can't accept your feelings.

759
3059
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,680
Honestly, I came here to tell you that today.

760
3063
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,990
I can't say I'm completely surprised.

761
3067
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,910
I'm sorry...

762
3071
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,450
Is it okay

763
3075
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:09,430
if I ask for the reason?

764
3079
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:11,850
The real reason.

765
3083
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:16,410
I think only then can I have real closure.

766
3087
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:31,530
This is the ring someone gave me when he proposed.

767
3091
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:36,850
Honestly, during all those time, I still carried this around with me.

768
3095
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,370
When I was dating you,

769
3099
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:43,610
I also tried my best to give you

770
3103
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:46,330
my heart.

771
3107
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:47,950
However,

772
3111
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:54,150
it turns out, one's heart isn't something you can work for.

773
3115
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:57,950
It just comes.

774
3119
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,590
That's a great phrase.

Is it manageable to be living in that one-room place?

782
3151
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:51,560
Yes, it is very great.

783
3155
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:57,140
I never imagined that a one-room place like that can be such an ideal living space.

784
3159
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,190
That is good to hear.

Se Hee, by any chance,

786

How did you know?

788
3175
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,130
She's supposed to be coming over today.

What? Rang?

790

Yes.

791
3187
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,640
She went to the district office and filed some documents

792
3191
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,080
and she plans to finalize things at the rooftop place.

So not in the business class then.

883

My mileages. It'd be nice for you to use them too for business trips.

891
3596
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,960
You can upgrade your seat too.

Oh. That's be super great for me, of course.

893

Oh, right?

895

Then should we just do it? Getting married?

896
3616
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:35,650

- Why, you don't want to?

897

01:16:58,570 --> 01:16:59,830
Hmm.

926
3738
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:04,560
Do you want a beer?

927
3742
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:23,200
<i>We registered our marriage three years ago.</i>

928
3746
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,870
<i>Along with registering our marriage,</i>

929
3750
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:29,570
<i>we rewrote our contract, too.</i>

930
3754
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,520
As we both paid half the deposit, this house is under both names.

931
3758
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,250
Any matters regarding the house shall be decided by mutual agreement.

932
3762
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:41,950
- Do you have any objections? 
- I don't!

933
3767
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:48,940
On Thanksgiving, we will each go to our family's home and spend time there, apart.

934
3771
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,740
- This one is a bit...
 - Why?

935
3776
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,270
Do you have a problem with it?

936
3780
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,530
Won't this be difficult?

937
3784
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:02,930
Korean tradition... to split up like this, to visit on Thanksgiving...

938
3788
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:05,030
I think it will be difficult for our families to understand.

939
3792
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:08,000
Because it's not a visit. It's forced labor,

940
3796
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,190
and you endured it during our last Thanksgiving.

941
3800
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,900
Afterwards, we were both sorry to each other

942
3804
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,660
and felt awkward, for an entire week.

943
3808
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:19,930
I don't want to experience that with you ever again, Ji Ho.

944
3812
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:25,260
And what is so important about Korean tradition, anyway?

945
3816
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:28,390
Our tradition is what is most important.

946
3820
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:31,560
Okay. Call.

947
3824
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,370
It is something that conflicts with our "major premise," after all.

948
3828
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:37,160
The next one...

949
3832
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:41,070
<i>We renew our contract every year</i>

950
3836
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:46,060
<i>but our "major premise" is always the same.</i>

951
3840
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,390
<i>That our love</i>

952
3844
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,080
<i>comes first, before anything else.</i>

953
3848
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:55,440
- Call.
 - Call.

954
3853
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:59,240
<i>I admit that this isn't usual, of course.</i>

955
3857
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:03,170
<i>After our first Thanksgiving when we split up to visit each of our family homes</i>

956
3861
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:07,330
<i>Mother-in-law called me.</i>

957
3865
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:11,580
<i>And my father flipped the table over.</i>

958
3869
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:16,670
<i>But that was all.</i>

959
3873
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:21,540
<i>Nothing much else happened.</i>

960
3877
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:27,000
<i>We just became the "psycho couple" in other people's eyes</i>

961
3881
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
<i>and as a result, we were able to be faithful to the lives we wanted to live.</i>

962
3885
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:36,050
<i>Married or single,</i>

963
3889
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:40,070
<i>whether you register your marriage, or not,</i>

964
3893
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:42,110
<i>whatever your choice is</i>

965
3897
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,240
<i>the serious consequences that you imagine</i>

966
3901
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,520
<i>does not happen.</i>
 - It's going to start.

967
3906
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:04,630
<i>The important thing is, no matter what shape it is...</i>

968
3910
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:06,660
Ji Ho.

969
3914
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,300
Hmm?

970
3918
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:12,740
I love you.

971
3922
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,530
<i>that with that person next to you,</i>

972
3926
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:20,230
<i>in that moment,</i>

973
3930
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:22,480
<i>that you are together.</i>

974
3934
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:26,740
Me too.

975
3938
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:49,020
<i>So again, today, we</i>

976
3942
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:53,020
<i>decide to only love each other.</i>

01:20:58,310 --> 01:21:00,340
<i>And...</i>

979
3955
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:02,990
The bus is here.

980
