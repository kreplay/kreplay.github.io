00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,115
<i>Episode 3
"Please, teach me how to write a love contract!"</i>

2
8
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:11,445
Who's Sam Soon?

3
12
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,480
<i>That would be me?<i></i></i>

4
16
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,530
<i>Formally introduce her to me
by the end of this week.</i>

5
21
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,710
<i>Aren't you tired of meetings?</i>

6
25
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,107
<i>I don't think you're in the position
to be thinking of other's lives right now!</i>

7
30
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:20,457
<i>Are you currently seeing anyone?</i>

8
34
00:00:20,457 --> 00:00:27,000
<i>If there was someone that I was seeing right now, do you think I'd be using my precious days off going to arranged dates?</i>

9
38
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:32,231
<i>Should we ..... try dating?</i>

10
42
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:47,700
At Christmas time, she
turned my insides out.

11
47
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,598
My goodness. This is the first time since high school

12
51
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:53,210
to change her name that she's spent the night out.

13
55
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,864
Who is the guy?!

14
59
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,500
The guy that she met with yesterday got home early...

15
63
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:07,435
Is this girl feigning about not having a
boyfriend and hiding a guy somewhere?

16
68
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,017
Well whoever the guy is, by fall she'll be getting married.

17
72
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,003
Wait...

18
76
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,421
she can't have a full belly before she gets marries.

19
80
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,155
Eh, who cares.

20
84
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:25,987
We'll just do it in court.

21
88
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,700
Get in.

22
92
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:40,678
What's with the taxi?

23
96
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:49,770
Where are you going?

24
100
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,920
Can't you see I'm going to work?

25
104
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,494
I can't ride the bus, let's just take a taxi.

26
108
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:57,025
What do you mean you can't ride the bus?

27
112
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:59,945
Are your feet golden?

28
116
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,038
Let's just take a taxi.

29
120
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,244
No, I told you I don't want to!

30
124
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:06,060
I don't even know when I'll get fired.
I need to save all the money I have.

31
129
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,575
I'll pay

32
133
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:09,950
I don't like because it's degrading and dirty.

33
137
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,845
You're probably going to talk about dating after paying for the taxi, aren't you?

34
141
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:15,659
Chi... the bus is here.

35
145
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,531
I said I don't want to. Why do you keep asking me?

36
149
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:27,200
And like I asked, why don't you want to?

37
153
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,420
Do you think it makes sense to act as
if we're "going out" in front of your mother?

38
158
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
I can't take part in such a swindle.

39
162
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:38,253
Isn't calling Kim Sam Soon, Kim Hee Jin a fraud too?

40
166
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:41,524
Well then you try living as Sam Shik for 30 years.

41
170
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:45,532
This has to do with a person's personal right and life quality.  
It's different from a fake relationship.

42
175
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,235
That goes for me too.  The quality of my life is on the line.

43
179
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:54,461
Well then, isn't it only right to try and persuade your mother?

44
183
00:02:55,781 --> 00:03:00,759
I hate meetings so much that I'm
on the verge of proposing a fake relationship.

45
188
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,000
I tried it earlier.

46
192
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,363
Ha! You can't even persuade your own mother, and you're trying to run a business?

47
196
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,200
Get up.

48
200
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,000
We're still a long ways away.

49
204
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,900
I'm asking you to share your seat.

50
208
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,700
What did you just say?

51
212
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:28,287
From now on, while we're dating,
I decline riding buses or subways.

52
217
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:30,706
What a jerk.

53
221
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,900
You'll be a formal employee starting this month.

54
225
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,500
What did you just say?

55
229
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,800
Formal employee.

56
233
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,400
Let me ask you one question. Why me out of all people?

57
237
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:57,000
Why did you pick me out of all people to take part in
this fraudulent relationship?

58
242
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,200
Because we'll never really liked each other

59
246
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,600
Huh?

60
250
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:03,856
We both think the other is a jerk.

61
254
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:06,817
Look, me thinking that you're
a jerk is true.

62
259
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:10,481
An alcoholic, bully and a urinator isn't really my type, you know?

63
263
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:12,887
Are you going to keep taunting me about something that hasn't even been proven?

64
267
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:17,027
Anyway, you seem to know
how to handle your position well.

65
272
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:20,743
Knowing how to manage the situations you're
in, what kind of man you should be with?

66
277
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:26,056
Knowing this, I know that later on you wouldn't go after a man like me, right?

67
281
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,900
Wait, so you're saying that I'll like you later on?!

68
285
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:35,045
Wow, you're definitely a MIJI King.

69
289
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:36,581
What the heck is a MIJI King?

70
293
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,100
If you're so curious, look it up on the Internet.

71
297
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,400
I'll reward you. How much will do?

72
301
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:48,084
You shouldn't live like that, President.

73
305
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:53,811
Oh, and since you seem to resolve
all your problems with money,

74
310
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:57,300
if you give me your whole restaurant, then I'll consider it.

75
314
00:04:58,118 --> 00:05:00,199
Why do you keep saying no?

76
318
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,100
Instead of just saying you don't want to, give me a reason...
a reason that I can comprehend.

77
323
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,859
I told you yesterday.

78
327
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:12,597
I'm not lucky as you so

79
331
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:15,796
I can't cruise around the Pacific.

80
335
00:05:15,796 --> 00:05:21,308
That means I want to meet someone when I'm 31-33 to cross the Pacific with.

81
339
00:05:21,308 --> 00:05:27,246
Which means I don't have time to date someone who doesn't know what a small boat is.

82
343
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:29,826
Do you understand now?

83
347
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,900
I'm going to work now.  You can come in 5 minutes later to avoid any misunderstanding.

84
351
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,640
That's how you do it like this.

85
355
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,860
Forget strict etiquette and preconceived notions.

86
359
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,759
The important thing is to feel and enjoy the wine.

87
363
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,851
Since today's the first lesson,
let's share our thoughts on wine....

88
368
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:08,702
Miss Hee Jin, you're late.

89
372
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,954
Yes.

90
376
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:12,265
I told you not to be late because it'll be 
our first wine lesson.

91
381
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:14,745
I'm sorry.

92
385
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:18,045
What is this in front of the whole restaurant family?

93
389
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,249
If you're the oldest, you should be more
careful and not embarrass yourself.

94
394
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:22,700
Don't scold her too much.

95
398
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,800
She's late because she spent the night with me.

96
402
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:01,028
Why is that man

97
406
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:04,864
saying unnecessary things to make me a common enemy.

98
410
00:07:04,864 --> 00:07:07,799
He's most definitely a stopping block in my life.

99
414
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:19,422
<i>"Kyung Hee Kyung Dry Cleaners"</i>

100
418
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,134
Hello? Is this Kyung Hee Kyung Dry Cleaners?

101
422
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:36,612
I wanted to ask a question...Yes...

102
426
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:41,872
You delivered some clothes to Kyung Hee
Gong apartment 402 this morning, right?

103
431
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:48,996
Yes, yes, a man's suit and a lady's 2-piece?

104
435
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:53,778
What was on the lady's 2-piece?

105
439
00:07:56,176 --> 00:08:00,301
I mean not vomit...

106
443
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:06,455
It's a little weird saying this but...

107
447
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:14,315
like urine or something like that?

108
451
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:41,435
It seems like he's just lying but since
I can't seem to find proof, I can't just confront him.

109
456
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:43,918
I really did something like that?!

110
460
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,690
No way! No way...that kind of Sam Soonish act?

111
464
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,069
You still talk to yourself?

112
468
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,700
Long time no see, Sam Soon.

113
472
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,800
Second Unnie?!

114
476
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,753
Tell me the truth. It doesn't seem like you're here to visit.

115
480
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:04,307
Did you fight with your husband?

116
484
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:06,911
Sam Soon, you seem even more bloated!

117
488
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,400
Hey, did you live on soju and chicken feet all winter
using your breakup as an excuse?

118
493
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,000
The pain's finally healing. I wish for no more prodding at it.

119
497
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,286
You can't do that.

120
501
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:22,694
A girl's got to be pretty and skinny

121
505
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:28,260
Look at me. That's the reason why there's
no end to guys even after I got married.

122
510
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,400
Unnie! Are you cheating..?

123
514
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,700
Look it up in the 2005 dictionary.

124
518
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:42,372
Cheating is defined by a male formerly
known as your brother-in-law.

125
523
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:44,020
He cheated on you?!

126
527
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,370
You can't read between the lines?

127
531
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,312
Hey, I am divorced.

128
535
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,800
Divorced...you got a divorce?!

129
539
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,528
I have no doubt that you, Sam Soon,

130
543
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:04,874
will welcome my return to single life with open arms.

131
547
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:06,741
Why would I welcome you?

132
551
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:09,647
It only means one more competitor.

133
555
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:12,550
Did your liver bloat along with your body?

134
559
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,066
Hey, no matter what, you can't be my opponent.

135
563
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,100
It's because of divorcees like you that old maids 
like me keep increasing, you know?!

136
568
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,136
Oh yeah!

137
572
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:34,487
By any chance, is there like  "peeing when you're drunk"
kind of genetics in our family?

138
577
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:43,325
Should we go in later?

139
581
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,016
Don't you want to go to a sauna?  How about a sauna?

140
585
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:48,770
Isn't it weirder for you to creep in while mom's sleeping?

141
589
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,630
True.

142
593
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,445
Man, I'm so tired.

143
597
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:58,825
If I get caught now I'll probably be interrogated for several hours

144
601
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,224
You said you came yesterday. You didn't get sleep?

145
605
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:03,779
Can you sleep in a sauna?

146
609
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:09,230
If you don't even have the guts to win
against mom, why did you get a divorce?

147
614
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,800
Divorce?!

148
618
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:15,426
What are you talking about?

149
622
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:16,873
You came back divorced?!

150
626
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:20,492
I...I...No, I missed you so much,

151
630
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:26,930
and I wanted to go to a sauna really badly and eat your kimchijjigae.

152
634
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:32,481
Brother-in-law cheated on her, so she got her part of the settlements and stamped the divorce papers.

153
638
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:33,458
WHAT?!

154
642
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,166
That's not it!  That's not it!

155
646
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Bad girl...

156
650
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,228
Hey! Kim Kyung Hee, Moon Jung Nim!

157
654
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,550
Hey Yoo Hee Jin.

158
658
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,800
Hee Jin, what are you doing here?
 Have you been well?

159
663
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:14,701
What about Min Jung?

160
667
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:18,906
I heard she goes to a dermatologist to get
her whole face peeled. Did she really go?

161
672
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,675
Don't even talk about it.

162
676
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:24,550
She went every month and her face became so sensitive

163
680
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,210
that even one drop of alcohol makes her break out. I'm not kidding.

164
684
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,110
She'll be here later.

165
688
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,450
Did you re-register for school?

166
692
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,753
Yeah, I came after submitting it.

167
696
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:39,326
I'm so envious. I'm still a student. When I
come for practice, you guys better be nice!

168
701
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:44,231
Why did you go to the U.S.?
It wasn't even for school.

169
706
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,466
Just ...

170
710
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,734
Let's say I was traveling.

171
714
00:12:46,734 --> 00:12:48,837
Traveling for 3 years?

172
718
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:50,738
And you left with graduation only a year away.

173
722
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,573
What can't you do with money?

174
726
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:53,742
I hear your parents' business is doing well?

175
730
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:57,211
Right. So I used my rich dad to have some fun before coming back.

176
734
00:12:57,211 --> 00:13:00,014
Anyway, you're awful. Three years and no call?

177
738
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:04,018
If you had been 3 weeks later, I was
going to end it forever with you.

178
743
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:06,019
Why 3 weeks?

179
747
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,655
Jung Nim is getting married in 3 weeks.

180
751
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,991
Really?! With whom?

181
755
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,000
With me.

182
759
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,130
Welcome!  Welcome!

183
763
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,570
Welcome. How many?

184
767
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,373
I came about the engagement party.
The President told you, right?

185
772
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:28,041
Ah yes, your name is Jang Chae Ri?

186
776
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:28,710
Yes, that's right.

187
780
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,677
If you'll come this way...

188
784
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:34,581
Huh? Hey, aren't you Chae Ri?

189
788
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,300
Sam Soon unnie?

190
792
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,124
Sam Soon unnie, you work here?

191
796
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,068
Sam Soon unnie?

192
800
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,635
Something smells fishy.

193
804
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,573
Sam Soon unnie, what's wrong?

194
808
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:03,243
Let go, let go! Really, why are you doing this?

195
812
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:07,990
Hey, long time, no see.

196
816
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,902
This is the first time since I went to Paris,
so it's been about 6 years?

197
821
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:17,924
Wow, you grew a lot! Back then you were "yea" tall.

198
825
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:22,317
I thought so. It's because you're wearing
high heels that make you look that tall.

199
830
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,936
Anyway, you're still doing that?

200
834
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:30,767
Hey, I haven't been able to change my name legally yet.

201
838
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:34,997
Hey, I'm known as Kim Hee Jin here, okay?

202
842
00:14:34,997 --> 00:14:36,761
You did that all throughout middle school and high school.

203
846
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:38,488
How's your mom?

204
850
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:42,518
Okay, sometimes she reminisces about your family's rice cakes.

205
854
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:45,049
Anyway, since when did you start working here?

206
858
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:48,464
I know the president oppa here well,
but I've never seen you before.

207
863
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:50,496
The president oppa?

208
867
00:14:50,496 --> 00:14:54,123
We grew up together so we're like brothers and sisters.

209
871
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:56,799
Oh really?

210
875
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,677
Wait, then will you be making the
cake for my engagement party?

211
880
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,523
Cake for an engagement party?

212
884
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,703
Oh, are you getting engaged here?

213
888
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,923
Hey! Congratulations, Jang Chae Ri.

214
892
00:15:09,923 --> 00:15:14,916
Finally another competitor has been
removed. You made a really good decision.

215
897
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,280
Even though I had to wait, it's good.

216
901
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:20,983
I'll make you the world's best
engagement party cake, okay?

217
906
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:23,339
Anyway, what does your fiance do?

218
910
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:26,053
Why do you need to know?

219
914
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:29,987
Hey! Ahjussi!

220
918
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,320
Unni, this is my ahjussi.

221
922
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:54,927
Who?

222
926
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:55,736
You don't need to know.

223
930
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:59,787
She's just a daughter of a rice cake store 
 my mom and grandma used to go to.

224
935
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,509
Let's go inside...

225
939
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,184
Hello, nice to meet you. I am Hyun Jin Hun.

226
943
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:16,893
fI'm Min Hyun Woo. Please take care of me.

227
947
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:29,489
Unnie! What are you doing?

228
951
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,275
What?

229
955
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,830
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

230
959
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:37,315
What do you think of Hyun Woo?

231
963
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:39,543
You didn't come here to get my approval.

232
967
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:41,070
Aren't you jealous?

233
971
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:41,606
Yeah.

234
975
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:42,686
Really?

235
979
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:44,962
You won't leave until I say that to you.

236
983
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:47,408
It seems as if I've seen him before.

237
987
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:52,900
Really? Maybe at one of our get togethers?
My ahjussi's Maru Construction's second son.

238
992
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,938
I've never heard of it.

239
996
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:57,358
They're starting to become famous. A rising star shall I say?

240
1000
00:16:57,358 --> 00:17:00,506
Your family is building a hotel in Jeju.

241
1004
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:02,261
They're in charge of that project. You didn't know?

242
1008
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:04,429
These are pictures from Sohi's engagement.

243
1012
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:06,578
Look it over and order anything you want from it.

244
1016
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:12,780
You know that you were  my first love, right?

245
1020
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:15,438
Your fiancee's outside.

246
1024
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:19,773
I'm going to become someone else's in a bit. Can't you hug me just once?

247
1028
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,483
Last time?

248
1032
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,120
Who would see?

249
1036
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,439
Chae Ri

250
1040
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,200
Yeah?

251
1044
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:38,800
The color of those lenses are not doing anything for you.

252
1048
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,240
What the!

253
1052
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,440
--When you're making syrup, you can't let the fire cover the pan.
--Okay.

254
1057
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,362
And the sugar on the side can just be brushed  off like this.

255
1061
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:10,054
Ah, okay. Unnie, were you really with the president that night?

256
1065
00:18:12,276 --> 00:18:13,656
I have no interest in the president.

257
1069
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:14,508
Really?

258
1073
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:20,638
Yeah. To use someone's phrase,"I know my position well."

259
1077
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,930
Just a moment.

260
1081
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,983
I'll do it.  
 Keep stirring it.

261
1086
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,510
<i>That dude</i>

262
1090
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,230
♫ <i> Never let me go.</i> ♫

263
1094
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:46,420
♫ <i>Love me tender, love me sweet.</i> ♫

264
1098
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:52,530
♫ <i> You have made my life complete.</i> ♫

265
1102
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,580
♫ <i> And I love you so. </i> ♫

266
1106
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:58,336
Thanks for acting as if you didn't know me.

267
1110
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:03,974
No need for thanks.
 You acted so well that I just went along with it.

268
1115
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,273
I feel thorns in those words.

269
1119
00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:08,097
Is that all?

270
1123
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,072
Do you still have a
grudge against me?

271
1128
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:12,698
What grudge?

272
1132
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,960
If it had been the girl that I saw you with last Christmas
then I probably would still resent you,

273
1137
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,200
but a third woman?

274
1141
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:21,477
I can't be more thankful
that we broke up earlier.

275
1146
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:23,468
My family wants the girl.

276
1150
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:25,560
Obviously, since she's rich.

277
1154
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:27,012
She said she liked me.

278
1158
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:29,438
Likely, since she's so young.

279
1162
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:35,940
Seeing how Chae Ri wants to marry you,
I guess it's true you come from a great family.

280
1167
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,113
I'm sorry that I didn't recognize how
prominent of a family you came from.

281
1172
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:44,075
Anyway, do your engagement somewhere else.

282
1176
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,621
She won't have it anywhere but there.
You know well how stubborn she is.

283
1181
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:54,180
Then, are you telling me to make your engagement cake?

284
1185
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,136
I'm sorry. If I had known, I would've done anything to not go there.

285
1189
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:02,607
You wouldn't be human if you still came
knowing. You'd be a son of a bitch.

286
1194
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:06,441
Vulgar mouth is still the same, I see.

287
1198
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:11,406
On the contrary, a lot of people seem to like
my vulgarity, so I decided to keep it as it is.

288
1203
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,302
Did you find a man?

289
1207
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,753
Yeah.

290
1211
00:20:18,753 --> 00:20:20,388
Already?

291
1215
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:22,318
What do you mean already?

292
1219
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:27,900
It hasn't even been that long since we broke up,
how long has it been since you were crying your eyes out?

293
1224
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,728
There's a thing called phantom pain.

294
1228
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,799
Even if your limbs are cut off, you feel the pain. 
Your brain

295
1233
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,701
is wired that way.
 Even your limbs are like that

296
1238
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:40,070
how would a person's heart feel?

297
1242
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,921
Did it not hurt, cutting me loose?

298
1246
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:43,934
It doesn't hurt and you're already meeting a 
different guy?

299
1251
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:45,579
What the hell are you complaining about?

300
1255
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,746
What makes you any better?

301
1259
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:53,585
Yeah, I know that I haven't done anything right, 
but

302
1264
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:58,823
I've never forgot about you.  
 The love stopped but was never forgotten.

303
1269
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:02,477
Here. You'll always be here!

304
1273
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,140
<i>I did not know back then, how empty</i>

305
1277
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,966
<i>all the promises he made were.</i>

306
1281
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:35,843
<i>if there had been no promises,
 I wonder if it would be easier for me right now?</i>

307
1286
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:42,092
<i>Even though I know how baseless his talk is,
I hate myself for wanting to believe it...</i>

308
1291
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:48,260
<i>I hate myself for still wavering at</i>

309
1295
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,155
<i>the meaningless glances...</i>

310
1299
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:58,712
<i>Losing love may just mean losing
one's self-confidence...</i>

311
1304
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:09,646
Ah! Mister! Watch your driving!
I still haven't gotten married yet!

312
1309
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,592
I'm home.

313
1313
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:20,431
-This is outrageous! I don't know! You go look for him!
-What's this noise?

314
1318
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:24,474
-I'm not leaving this house!
-What's wrong?

315
1323
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,235
Did you know that dad cosigned for uncle's debt security?

316
1327
00:22:30,235 --> 00:22:32,946
Debt security? How did our dead father do that?

317
1331
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:37,138
--Right before he died...mom didn't know about it.
--So then?

318
1336
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:43,112
The factory went bankrupt. Uncle's on the run,
and our house is about to be taken away.

319
1341
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,178
What did you say?

320
1345
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:49,295
How can someone deceive me like this?  
I'm Park Bong Sook.

321
1350
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:51,267
-Mom why don't you get up.
-Shut up.

322
1355
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:53,208
I don't want to see anyone with
the last name of Kim.

323
1360
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:59,001
I cleaned and scrubbed this place while
getting yelled at by my father-in-law.

324
1365
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,362
Those thieves. 
 Just try to lay a hand on this house!

325
1370
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:05,920
That'll be the day my coffin's made.

326
1374
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,128
How much is needed to save this house?

327
1378
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:09,791
Why do you need to know?

328
1382
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,491
I have the Mapo apartment.

329
1386
00:23:16,497 --> 00:23:20,370
Leave it alone. You don't even know
what's going to happen to you.

330
1391
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:26,503
You need to keep that money.
Don't worry about it.  No one is taking this house.

331
1396
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:32,503
I'm going to catch your uncle and make  sure we resolve this problem. I'll make him die in prison, I will!

332
1400
00:23:32,503 --> 00:23:34,734
Let's think about this rationally.

333
1404
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:40,360
Whether Uncle goes to prison or not, this house is the collateral.

334
1408
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,080
If we don't come up with the money, we have to give this house up.

335
1412
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:54,629
I'll be back.

336
1416
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,240
<i>Sam Soon's Flower Garden</i>

337
1420
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:23,284
<i>Since this is your flowerbed, you have to give it water and tell it that it's pretty. Take good care of it.</i>

338
1424
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:35,083
<i>No... change it. I want it changed.</i>

339
1428
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,473
<i>Dear, how can I change the name your grandfather gave you?</i>

340
1432
00:24:38,473 --> 00:24:41,966
<i>And anyway, why don't you like the name Sam Soon?</i>

341
1436
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:46,657
<i>It's good to say and also endearing.
Sam Soon's my favorite name in the world.</i>

342
1441
00:24:46,657 --> 00:24:51,201
<i>No, I want to change it. Change it to Kim Hee Jin!</i>

343
1445
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:56,975
<i>This is Sam Soon's tree</i>

344
1449
00:25:02,556 --> 00:25:04,828
<i>And this is Sam Soon's swing.</i>

345
1453
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:17,207
<i>Let's get on it.</i>

346
1457
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,800
<i>--You're not scared?
 --Yes.</i>

347
1462
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:24,483
<i>Wow, Sam Soon, you're doing so well.</i>

348
1466
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:33,090
I shouldn't have fallen for his trick back then.

349
1470
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:43,163
Daddy, what will happen to my flowerbed
if this house is handed over?

350
1475
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:50,637
My tree, my swing...

351
1479
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:39,973
I'm home.

352
1483
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,275
I guess it'd be too
hard by this Saturday...

353
1488
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,205
Oh no, it's my fault for
calling so suddenly.

354
1493
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,910
That's okay.

355
1497
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:58,326
Anyhow, please put it up for sale
and contact me. Please. Thank you.

356
1502
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:01,662
What did they say? No?

357
1506
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,352
It's not possible for an apartment to be sold in just a few days.

358
1510
00:27:09,518 --> 00:27:13,289
Hey do you have any money saved up?

359
1514
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:15,565
How would she have any money?

360
1518
00:27:16,207 --> 00:27:21,823
All the money that was saved up was used towards her studies in Paris, and the money saved up from work here...

361
1522
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,797
Where's the money from work?

362
1526
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,638
I only saved up half, so it's not much.

363
1530
00:27:35,543 --> 00:27:39,222
I thought you were going to 
open up a shop with this money?

364
1535
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:43,897
That can be done slowly.
 What's the use of a shop if we lose our home?

365
1540
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,195
I'll fill it back up after I sell the apartment.

366
1544
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,564
With this and add mine...

367
1548
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:54,768
Mom, how much can you get right now?
 5,000,000

368
1553
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,950
5,000,000 [About $5,000]

369
1557
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:03,449
Then we're still  50,000,000 short.

370
1561
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,421
Want to try calling big sister?

371
1565
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:10,684
Don't do that. It's probably hard enough for them too.

372
1569
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,800
"MIJI KING"

373
1573
00:28:55,474 --> 00:29:00,485
Seen by 6,740...chi.

374
1577
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:22,900
What's up?

375
1581
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,849
I'm busy.

376
1585
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:33,029
That proposal...

377
1589
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:34,887
Yes.

378
1593
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:39,720
Is it still available?

379
1597
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,560
Yes

380
1601
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,967
Then if I do take up that proposal...

381
1605
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,600
--How much do you need?
--Huh?

382
1610
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:48,156
You have the "I need money" face.

383
1614
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:50,367
How much is needed?

384
1618
00:29:52,652 --> 00:29:53,505
50,000,000

385
1622
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,800
Give me your account number.

386
1626
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:57,465
I'll do it through internet banking.

387
1630
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:37,175
It's finished. Do you want to check it?

388
1634
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:39,415
No, it's okay.

389
1638
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,200
Then from today on, we're "dating" okay?

390
1642
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,205
Okay.

391
1646
00:30:58,184 --> 00:31:01,072
I'll try to repay you as soon as possible.

392
1650
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:10,314
I even took out my savings ... 
and if my sister's apartment sells soon.

393
1655
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:14,288
--If you do your part well, there's no
need for you to have to pay it back.
--Huh?

394
1661
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:17,066
As long as you can completely fool 
President Nah.

395
1666
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:24,628
No way. I can't just take ... 
 I can't just take so much money.

396
1671
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:28,520
I'll pay you back as soon as possible, with interest.

397
1675
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,344
How much?

398
1679
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:32,950
How much interest are you going to give me?

399
1683
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:40,881
I can't give you too much, but about as much as the bank interest...

400
1687
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:43,800
Okay then, let's do it with the bank interest then.

401
1691
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,200
Yes.

402
1695
00:32:01,437 --> 00:32:02,800
President ...

403
1699
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,724
Yes.

404
1703
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:11,906
How come you don't ask me why I need to borrow 
 such a big sum of money or where I'm going to use it?

405
1708
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:13,430
Is there a reason why I need to know?

406
1712
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,340
No.

407
1716
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,263
Oh yeah, Ms. Kim Sam Soon.

408
1720
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:28,570
I mean Ms. Kim Hee Jin.

409
1724
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:39,155
What are you doing? Where are we going?

410
1728
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:41,401
Really, what are you doing?

411
1732
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:46,326
Why are you doing this, let me go.

412
1736
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:53,296
Oh my goodness, where are we going? Why are you doing this?

413
1740
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,282
Really why are you doing this!

414
1744
00:32:58,092 --> 00:33:01,769
Everyone, we are currently dating.

415
1748
00:33:06,724 --> 00:33:09,051
It's been 2 months.

416
1752
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,212
Are you crazy?

417
1756
00:33:22,018 --> 00:33:26,764
If we are to trick President Nah, 
we have to trick the spy also.  
The problem is we don't know who that is.

418
1762
00:33:26,764 --> 00:33:29,894
That's why we have to pretend like we're dating 
 in front of all the employees.

419
1767
00:33:29,894 --> 00:33:34,390
Like I told you earlier, you don't have to pay back the money if you can keep up with you part of the deal.

420
1771
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:40,231
An interesting dating experience and 50,000,000 
 it doesn't seem like a bad deal.

421
1776
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:46,857
Let's take this. It's the style Suk sisters like.

422
1780
00:33:57,031 --> 00:33:59,350
So how old are you?

423
1784
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,079
Yes, I am 30 years-old this year.

424
1788
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,019
<i>I thought her face looked old. She's old in age too?!</i>

425
1792
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:06,983
These days being 3 years older isn't anything.

426
1796
00:34:06,983 --> 00:34:10,908
Son, why don't you shut your mouth and stay still?

427
1800
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,019
So, how long have you known my Jin Hun?

428
1804
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,610
Yes, it has been 2 months.

429
1808
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,138
<i>Sleeping together in 2 months...This is a loose girl, isn't she?</i>

430
1812
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:24,971
And both of your parents are living? What does your father do?

431
1816
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:28,787
My father died 3 years ago.

432
1820
00:34:28,787 --> 00:34:31,017
<i>And to add to that, a single parent family?</i>

433
1824
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:36,260
What did he do when he was living?

434
1828
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,062
Yes, he worked in the food industry.

435
1832
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:41,596
<i>Now we're getting somewhere.</i>

436
1836
00:34:41,596 --> 00:34:46,066
The food industry, I know of well.
What kind of work did he do?

437
1841
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:48,665
Yes, he owned the "Sam Soon's Mill."

438
1845
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:56,071
Yes. It was in the family since my grandfather,

439
1849
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,804
but after my father passed away, it was sold to a family friend.

440
1853
00:35:01,804 --> 00:35:08,184
And with the money that was saved up, 
my mother runs a small financial business with the market people.

441
1858
00:35:08,184 --> 00:35:11,231
A small financial business? Like a small bank?

442
1862
00:35:11,231 --> 00:35:15,739
No, She makes money lending on a daily interest.

443
1866
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:20,675
<i>Is this girl plain naive or just plain stupid?!</i>

444
1870
00:35:20,675 --> 00:35:22,382
<i>Jin Hun, stupid boy, if he's trying to trick me,</i>

445
1874
00:35:22,382 --> 00:35:24,693
<i>he should've brought someone more believable than her.</i>

446
1878
00:35:24,693 --> 00:35:28,487
<i>How the heck did he get this out-of-date red bean bun?</i>

447
1882
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,205
So, do you love my Jin Hun?

448
1886
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,120
Pardon me?

449
1890
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:37,631
As much as today's called the rocket speed age,

450
1894
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:40,469
how much could your love have grown deeply in just 2 months?

451
1898
00:35:41,108 --> 00:35:44,397
I'm curious as to knowing how much you love my son.

452
1902
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:52,140
<i>You think I don't know? You think you hit a jackpot, huh?</i>

453
1906
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,259
<i>A mill dares to mess with a hotel?</i>

454
1910
00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:57,260
You don't seem to want to answer, Sam Soon?

455
1914
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:01,675
Mother,

456
1918
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,460
there is a fragile novelist.

457
1922
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:12,074
This novelist writes all night, and at dawn she puts it on her husband's desk for him to see.

458
1926
00:36:12,074 --> 00:36:16,487
Then the husband reads it before he goes to work.

459
1930
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:22,190
Every morning the husband
becomes his wife's first reader.

460
1935
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:28,261
I'm going to give Jin Hun the cakes that I make.

461
1939
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:30,864
He'll be the very first to taste my cakes.

462
1943
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:39,256
I want him to be the very first one to
taste the most delicious cakes I make.

463
1948
00:36:40,143 --> 00:36:45,668
I love him that much.

464
1952
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:02,977
I love you.

465
1956
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,210
I love you...oh~Sam Shik.

466
1960
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:36,500
Oh ... Sam Shik ... oh ... Sam Shik.

467
1964
00:37:37,018 --> 00:37:40,893
A millery's third daughter? You did well.

468
1968
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:42,850
Well,  I'm the second son of an inn's owner.

469
1972
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,754
Hey, you empty-headed boy.

470
1976
00:37:44,754 --> 00:37:46,424
Your wife isn't just anybody.

471
1980
00:37:46,424 --> 00:37:49,273
She's to be the mother of Miju, 
and the wife of a hotel owner.

472
1985
00:37:49,273 --> 00:37:52,613
And you bring a millery's third daughter?

473
1989
00:37:52,613 --> 00:37:55,589
And on top of that, no college and older?

474
1993
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:58,392
And a bean bun at that.

475
1997
00:37:59,082 --> 00:38:03,276
A bean bun that's been way past its expiration date that it's probably all mushy and squishy.

476
2001
00:38:03,276 --> 00:38:08,029
And her voice is like a cat!

477
2005
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:12,682
--She's way better than all the other girls that you've
chosen in the past.
---What?

478
2011
00:38:12,682 --> 00:38:16,671
She works with her own hands and is trying to build her
dreams into reality.

479
2016
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:21,080
She's different from those girls that go rolling around in the luxury that their parents provide them.

480
2020
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,689
So what? You're saying I've only brought you bimbos?

481
2024
00:38:22,689 --> 00:38:24,736
And she knows her position well.

482
2028
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:29,461
She knows what she's supposed to do in this world,
 and how she should be living.

483
2033
00:38:29,461 --> 00:38:33,479
She has  very healthy and upright living standards. Very clear headed girl.

484
2037
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,689
-Knows her position?
-Yeah right.

485
2042
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,378
Shall I go on?

486
2046
00:38:38,378 --> 00:38:40,060
You dim-witted boy.

487
2050
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,533
Have you completely forgotten about Hee Jin?

488
2054
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:49,515
Isn't she the reason why you've
created havoc at all the dates?

489
2059
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:52,150
No.

490
2063
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,432
Then why is your expression changing?

491
2067
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:57,847
I don't like talking about the past.

492
2071
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:03,544
Let me ask again.

493
2075
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:07,754
Are you sure you're meeting her because you've completely
forgotten Hee Jin?

494
2080
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:10,279
Yes.

495
2084
00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:11,877
Really?

496
2088
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:15,343
Truly? Can you swear it?

497
2092
00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:17,010
Yes.

498
2096
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:21,155
Fine. Let's see how it goes.

499
2100
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:28,214
I guess she deserves 50 points for
making you forget about Hee Jin.

500
2105
00:39:28,214 --> 00:39:32,553
I'll see her at the end of the year after
 adding or deducting  points after seeing how she does.

501
2110
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,745
And also, just in case this happens.

502
2114
00:39:36,745 --> 00:39:41,097
If Hee Jin does come back, don't even think about getting back together with her.

503
2118
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:44,384
I don't even want to see her.

504
2122
00:40:57,515 --> 00:40:59,468
Hi.

505
2126
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:09,735
I'm Sam Soon....No, Hee Jin unnie.
Who are you?

506
2131
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:23,644
Are you by any chance? Is your dad... Sam Shik?

507
2135
00:41:32,953 --> 00:41:35,899
What shall we make first?

508
2139
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:38,995
What can this be?

509
2143
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:44,179
Oh! It's Miju's poop! Oh!The poop fell out! How icky...!

510
2147
00:41:45,985 --> 00:41:48,670
This is my heart.

511
2151
00:41:54,743 --> 00:41:56,831
This is the Mrs. Catfish!

512
2155
00:41:58,584 --> 00:42:00,586
This is Uncle Sam Shik!

513
2159
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,439
Let me see your hand.

514
2163
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:06,570
Miju's ring...

515
2167
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:15,649
Do you like it? Huh? Huh?

516
2171
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:20,983
This is really a weird household.

517
2175
00:42:20,983 --> 00:42:29,300
The child doesn't talk and just smiles. The uncle's an ice prince,

518
2179
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:35,556
the niece a smiling princess, a blowfish
woman and a flat secretary...

519
2184
00:42:36,482 --> 00:42:39,401
I can't seem to understand.

520
2188
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,200
Wow. The lady made that for you?

521
2192
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,470
Next time, she'll make you a necklace too, right?

522
2196
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,038
Is that part of the deal too?

523
2200
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:09,475
No interest for a month.

524
2204
00:43:09,507 --> 00:43:11,973
That's the price of the ring.

525
2208
00:43:17,256 --> 00:43:19,762
That's the way Sam Shik is.

526
2212
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,690
<i>Hee Jin, did you see that? 
You liked it, right?</i>

527
2217
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:43,310
<i>Hi, Marvin!</i>

528
2221
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,530
<i>--Hey, how's it going?</i>

529
2225
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,800
Of course, Chris. Whassup, Chris?

530
2229
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,200
<i>Okay.  Okay.
 So. </i>

531
2234
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:01,600
<i>This is ... This is  the fifth time I've tried this video. Five.</i>

532
2238
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,600
<i>Hee Jin, there's something I really really want to tell you ... And, </i>

533
2242
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,600
<i>It's been bothering me for a while.  Umm ...</i>

534
2246
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:21,010
<i>I can remember the first time 
you came to the hospital In California</i>

535
2251
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:25,690
<i>and I remember the way you smiled at me? </i>

536
2255
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:31,080
<i>And  and the way your eyes were squincing ...</i>

537
2259
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,710
<i>I think about it so much.</i>

538
2263
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:40,510
<i>I think about you every day. Every day. </i>

539
2267
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:46,680
And ... no matter what,
 I can't, I can't get you out of my head.

540
2272
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,860
<i>The way you smile, the way you laugh, everything.</i>

541
2276
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,800
<i> Wow. So, Hee Jin</i>

542
2280
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:00,490
<i>I love you.</i>

543
2284
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:04,590
<i>I love you so much.</i>

544
2288
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:08,340
<i>I loved you since the first day I saw you. </i>

545
2292
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,950
<i>I know that you went back to Korea,</i>

546
2296
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,170
<i>and I know that you have someone else,</i>

547
2300
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,450
<i>but that's okay because ...</i>

548
2304
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:22,860
<i>my love for you is not going to change.</i>

549
2308
00:46:14,412 --> 00:46:16,051
Now what do you want me to play?

550
2312
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:19,390
Jin Hun let's hear that song.

551
2316
00:47:59,395 --> 00:48:02,160
Miss Sam Soon, don't you have a song request?

552
2320
00:48:03,452 --> 00:48:06,556
Is this the first time you've heard Jin Hun play the piano?

553
2324
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:08,536
Ah, yes.

554
2328
00:48:08,536 --> 00:48:14,471
Well that's good. You should take a chance and ask him to play
something you want.

555
2333
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:19,187
Can I do that?

556
2337
00:48:20,674 --> 00:48:23,420
It's the first time in several years
that I brought a girlfriend to my house.

557
2342
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,484
I can do that much.

558
2346
00:48:27,123 --> 00:48:32,205
I don't know if this song's okay.
"Over the Rainbow."

559
2351
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:37,092
Do you not know, "Over the Rainbow"?

560
2355
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,051
Hurry up and play it for me.

561
2359
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,814
I don't think that's possible.

562
2363
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,300
Why not?

563
2367
00:48:44,086 --> 00:48:45,404
I don't have the  sheet music.

564
2371
00:48:45,404 --> 00:48:48,345
You played the other songs without sheet music.

565
2375
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,200
I didn't memorize it.

566
2379
00:48:51,338 --> 00:48:53,370
Are you teasing me?

567
2383
00:48:53,904 --> 00:48:57,260
It's a 100 times easier than what you
just played, and you can't even play that?

568
2388
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,341
I want to hear it. Play it for me.

569
2392
00:48:59,341 --> 00:48:59,967
I can't play it.

570
2396
00:48:59,967 --> 00:49:01,376
-Play it!
-I told you I can't play it!

571
2401
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:04,726
Play it for me now! You can't even
do that for your girlfriend?

572
2406
00:49:20,062 --> 00:49:23,159
That's the song that Jin Hun's ex liked.

573
2410
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:28,973
Jin Hun isn't your first either, right?

574
2414
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,967
<i>This ice prince had an actual relationship?</i>

575
2418
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,196
<i>How did he not melt and live?</i>

576
2422
00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:51,033
We'll get off here.

577
2426
00:50:04,712 --> 00:50:07,331
From now on, don't ever demand
anything from me.

578
2431
00:50:08,202 --> 00:50:13,852
Demands, questions, anything that'll
put my mood down, don't do it.

579
2436
00:50:16,582 --> 00:50:23,625
Okay, I'm sorry for wanting you to
play a song you didn't want to play.

580
2441
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:27,175
But aren't you being a bit overpowering with the reason of lending me 50,000,000 won?

581
2445
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:29,540
You were begging before for this relationship.

582
2449
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,488
How come your beginning and end are so different?

583
2453
00:50:31,488 --> 00:50:35,152
Don't ask me questions, don't grumble, and irritate me!

584
2457
00:50:36,001 --> 00:50:38,306
Or I can just cancel the contract.

585
2461
00:50:39,499 --> 00:50:43,172
Fine, let's cancel the contract.

586
2465
00:50:44,446 --> 00:50:50,690
Damn it, just because of 50,000,000 won you can look down
at a person like this?

587
2470
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:54,921
I'll pay you back soon, so let's cancel it.

588
2474
00:50:55,747 --> 00:51:00,337
Where am I getting the money? I'll sell my organs.

589
2478
00:51:06,832 --> 00:51:10,339
Is there an organ that's that
expensive on that body?

590
2483
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:16,086
Oh, I guess you'll probably be good at bearing children.

591
2487
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:23,362
Yeah, hey, let's cancel it.

592
2491
00:51:23,362 --> 00:51:27,841
We didn't sign a contract or anything.
This never happened, okay?

593
2496
00:51:27,841 --> 00:51:31,853
Even if I have to use an agent,
I'll pay you back all the money.

594
2501
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:39,446
What are you doing?

595
2505
00:51:39,446 --> 00:51:42,755
Be still, Na president called a person.

596
2509
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,328
Called a person?

597
2513
00:51:46,366 --> 00:51:48,286
Don't turn you head, just look.

598
2517
00:51:48,286 --> 00:51:50,989
The guy with the Burberry coat.

599
2521
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:55,213
That's one of Na President's scrubs.

600
2525
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:58,227
He's probably looking to see if we're real or not.

601
2529
00:51:59,669 --> 00:52:05,344
Then does that mean we have to act in places like this also?

602
2533
00:52:07,665 --> 00:52:10,555
Were you going to just take off with the 50,000,000  then?

603
2537
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,526
Love Contract?!

604
2541
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:28,353
1. Hyun Jin Hun and Kim Sam Soon, through a voluntary and consensual agreement, will act as a couple until 12/31/2005.

605
2545
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,518
There will be no unnecessary skin-ship?

606
2549
00:52:30,518 --> 00:52:35,176
2. Hyun Jin Hun will not demand 
any skinship from Kim Sam Soon

607
2554
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,200
What man would want a woman like you?

608
2558
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,300
This also goes for Kim Sam Soon.

609
2562
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,100
You forgot the most important part.

610
2566
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:56,100
Exception. If necessary for acting like we're dating, we both agree to it.

611
2570
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,000
This is so childish. Are you writing a  teen age romance or something?

612
2574
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,542
It's a Harlequin Romance nowdays.

613
2578
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:05,258
Omo. And what the heck is this?

614
2582
00:53:05,258 --> 00:53:10,841
6. "Though we're acting like we're dating we do not actually date. Never."

615
2586
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,800
Never?

616
2590
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,075
What? You don't like it?

617
2594
00:53:17,075 --> 00:53:26,500
No, I like it very much, but what is this? "No two-timing"?

618
2598
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:31,121
Although this may be a fake relationship,
I can't have my woman meeting with other guys.

619
2603
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:33,692
Don't see any other guys other than me.

620
2607
00:53:34,296 --> 00:53:36,066
Who does he think he is?

621
2611
00:53:36,066 --> 00:53:38,063
Blind dates included.

622
2615
00:53:38,557 --> 00:53:42,176
This is dangerous. I guarantee he's not normal.

623
2619
00:53:42,176 --> 00:53:43,965
Did you just figure that out?

624
2623
00:53:43,965 --> 00:53:47,897
Thanks to that weirdo we were able to keep this house.

625
2627
00:53:47,897 --> 00:53:50,989
"If any of the 6 rules are broken, the contract will naturally be nulled.

626
2631
00:53:50,989 --> 00:53:58,505
If the responsibility falls on Kim Sam Soon, 
 she will pay back 50,000,000 immediately.

627
2636
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:05,000
If the responsibility falls on Hyun Jin Hun, then the 50 million won debt owed to him will be forgiven.

628
2640
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:09,191
Something smells fishy.

629
2644
00:54:09,191 --> 00:54:11,900
Yeah, something does smell.

630
2648
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,396
Something does smell. Did you put something on the gas-stove?

631
2652
00:54:14,396 --> 00:54:18,120
Oh my god, my bacon! What am I going to do.

632
2656
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:25,647
Yeah, she has a  million won worth body. How can she not get fat even while eating bacon like that??

633
2660
00:54:26,811 --> 00:54:31,442
There will be about 50 people, and for
each I've estimated around 10,000 won.

634
2665
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:34,622
From there just pick a few things from the menu...

635
2669
00:54:34,622 --> 00:54:36,034
The cake is the problem however.

636
2673
00:54:36,034 --> 00:54:37,994
They're being very picky about the cake.

637
2677
00:54:37,994 --> 00:54:39,348
What about the cake?

638
2681
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,300
They want the cake from Domarie.

639
2685
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,767
Why again?

640
2689
00:54:43,767 --> 00:54:47,342
It's become the word that Domarie's the best bakery out there.

641
2693
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,900
It's probably because of the patissier they brought in last fall.

642
2697
00:54:52,258 --> 00:54:56,961
People's tastes are so hard to please.
Last time it was the Don Telle Bakery.

643
2702
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,656
They find out about these like ghosts

644
2706
00:54:58,656 --> 00:55:01,168
Well then won't it be weird?

645
2710
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:03,005
We have a patissier, too.

646
2714
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,700
No, I think it'd be better that way.

647
2718
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:13,164
I know Chae Ri's personality very well, and she hates losing to anyone.

648
2722
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:17,290
I think she wants the best
engagement party there'll ever be,

649
2727
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:21,410
so that means the food must be the
best and of course so must the cake be.

650
2732
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,851
If they want it like that, we should just listen to them.

651
2736
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,200
They said the same thing too, but we decided that we'd do everything.

652
2740
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,500
I persuaded them that a
better cake than Domarie's will be made by us.

653
2745
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:44,977
Of course this has nothing to do with personal matters,

654
2749
00:55:44,977 --> 00:55:47,289
it's about the patissier, Kim Hee Jin.

655
2753
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:49,352
I don't think so~

656
2757
00:55:49,352 --> 00:55:50,415
No, really.

657
2761
00:55:50,415 --> 00:55:53,071
What do you mean no? If it's true, it's true.

658
2765
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,200
No, it's not.

659
2769
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,500
...it's not?

660
2773
00:56:02,212 --> 00:56:04,748
Kim Hee Jin, do you have confidence?

661
2777
00:56:04,748 --> 00:56:08,377
Yes, I'll do my best.

662
2781
00:56:08,377 --> 00:56:11,687
Hee Jin seems like a good person.

663
2785
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:16,100
Since you're so blunt, its okay to have a person like her around.

664
2789
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,100
Are you two going to get married?

665
2793
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,500
What? Am I moving too fast?

666
2797
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,834
Why did you get married?

667
2801
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:27,226
Me?

668
2805
00:56:27,226 --> 00:56:29,568
Why did I get married?

669
2809
00:56:29,568 --> 00:56:33,698
Oh yeah, I get cold so easily.

670
2813
00:56:33,698 --> 00:56:37,468
In the winter, it'd be so cold under
those blankets that I couldn't stand it.

671
2818
00:56:37,468 --> 00:56:42,556
So I thought about buying an
electrical warming pad or marrying somebody.

672
2823
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:46,708
Well I got married to the person that said he liked me but I had to spend money in the end

673
2827
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,700
since he passed away so early!!
On a ceramic bed that is.

674
2832
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,190
But then, as expected, only people can regulate that temperature.

675
2836
00:56:56,192 --> 00:56:58,499
You know I'm going to Jeju Island in the afternoon?

676
2840
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,877
Oh yes. Don't worry about anything and go.

677
2844
00:57:00,877 --> 00:57:04,908
And be more gentle to your mother.
When is the opening again?

678
2849
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
The 9th of next month.

679
2853
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:13,290
<i>Restaurant Break Period</i>

680
2857
00:57:22,262 --> 00:57:25,361
What did I do so wrong in my past life?

681
2861
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:33,238
What did I do wrong in my past life that I have to make 
the engagement cake of the man that dumped me?

682
2866
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,600
It's breaktime right now.

683
2870
00:57:51,737 --> 00:57:55,878
Lunch time has already ended miss.

684
2874
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:08,467
Preview for Episode 4
