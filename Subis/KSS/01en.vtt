<i>Episode 1: Life is like chocolate candy, a box full of chocolates.</i>

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
December 24, 2004

3
11
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:31,000
Without hesitation... you cheat on me?

4
15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,500
I'll show you how horrifying it is to be messing around with the

5
19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,400
Mill's third daughter - Kim Sam Soon.

6
23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,500
Today...you die, and I live.

7
27
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:55,885
Yes, it's room 1025. I'm requesting ChÃ¢teau wine and with that

8
31
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:59,300
bring something to eat as well.

9
35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,400
Who is it? Room service.

10
39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,600
How... did you get here?

11
43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,000
Last year Christmas... were you with another women?

12
47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,950
No... that day, my father's company's anniversary party.

13
51
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,400
Then how about the Christmas the year before that?

14
55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,985
That day, was also my father's company's... you know, darling, that December 24 is the anniversary for the company.

15
59
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:39,750
Then how about today?  What are you doing here instead of at the party?

16
63
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:48,750
Oh what do we do?  Today is December 24.

17
67
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,985
Memory loss is so common these days.

18
71
00:02:50,985 --> 00:02:57,100
You're the one who said the Catechin in green tea was good to prevent memory loss. Was that just a line?

19
75
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,100
-From now on drink a lot of green tea, you bastard.
-What's the matter with you?

20
80
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,600
Don't ask me what's wrong with me. Think about what you were doing wrong, you bastard.

21
84
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,845
Sam Soon, the brake in your brain isn't working now due to  a minor misunderstanding.

22
88
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:16,885
You could totally lose your mental equilibrium and lose everything. Chill.

23
92
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:19,052
Otherwise, you won't be able to control the violence.

24
96
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:21,850
Now... let's breathe.

25
100
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,500
Now deeply.

26
104
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,650
Are you f*ing bull s**ting me?

27
108
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,100
Hey, how can you say such vulgar words?!

28
112
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,900
Language and the way you live are deeply related. The way you talk reflects the way you live, so

29
116
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,835
Sam Soon, if you continue to use "f***", that's what your life will be like.

30
120
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:43,950
Stop kidding around.

31
124
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,550
You became depraved didn't you? Who did it?

32
128
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Who made you like this?!

33
132
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,100
I'm going to break you apart.

34
136
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,950
Excuse me,

35
140
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,800
If you're not going in, please move.

36
144
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,385
Who is it?

37
148
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:03,850
It's room service.

38
152
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,250
Sam Soon...

39
156
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,000
Get up.  Are you going to spend the night here? Hurry.

40
160
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,935
Get up.  We have something to talk about.

41
164
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,002
How can I get up?

42
168
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:50,600
You want me to help you?

43
172
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,550
How could anyone who is so humiliated get up?
You bastard!

44
177
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,750
How long have you known about it?

45
181
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,200
One month ago.

46
185
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,500
How?

47
189
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,150
I saw your text messages in your phone.

48
193
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,700
Did you perhaps use a GPS to locate where I was?

49
197
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,100
Then how come you didn't say anything for a month?

50
201
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,000
I didn't know what to do.

51
205
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,450
For a month, you lied to me.

52
209
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,150
You looked through my phone and even stalked me with a GPS.

53
213
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,900
And now you come to my hotel?

54
217
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,000
My man changed... If I didn't do that, would I be your girlfriend?

55
221
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
It's been a while since you changed.

56
225
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,300
If I called you, you hung up in seconds. You wouldn't reply to my

57
229
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,880
texts, and you made excuses like you were busy because you didn't want to meet me. 23 days ago.

58
233
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,660
It's been 23 days last month since I saw you,
 so I went to look for you at the company.

59
238
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:06,957
Do you remember how mad you got because I came without telling you?

60
242
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,610
A long time ago, you used to love it when I came looking for you like that,

61
246
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:22,000
and today is Christmas Eve. 
You left me by myself, so what do I do?

62
251
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
Should I just wait until you call for me?

63
255
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,700
So... did you feel betrayed?

64
259
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
Yeah.

65
263
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,100
-Do you feel resentment? 
- Yeah.

66
268
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
You lost faith in me too?

67
272
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,385
My mouth hurts.

68
276
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:32,635
So it can't be like the same as before.

69
280
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:33,600
Of course.

70
284
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,800
Then let's break up.

71
288
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:42,635
I didn't want to break up like this, but 
 I guess there's nothing I can do about it.

72
293
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:46,450
I'm sorry for not paying attention to you
all that time.

73
298
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,860
I won't explain everything to you.

74
302
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,771
Do you hate me?

75
306
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:51,400
No.

76
310
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,935
Do you love that woman?

77
314
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:54,800
No.

78
318
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,900
Then why?!

79
322
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,935
Tell me, you bastard!

80
326
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:00,900
What is your reason?!

81
330
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,860
You don't have to do this just because we broke up.

82
334
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,752
You used to say you liked it when I insulted you,
you jerk!

83
339
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,400
You said it was fun whenever I insulted you,
you bastard!

84
344
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,800
This isn't a stadium, lower your voice a bit.

85
348
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,600
There's nothing else I see in my eyes. What is your reason? Hurry and tell me.

86
352
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,500
Everyone knows you dumped me, Hyun Woo.
 So keep it simple, so that I can understand.

87
357
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,982
Tell me simply instead of saying  metaphors, figures of speech, similes, and bulls***,

88
361
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,100
Tell me instead of mathematics, philosophy, astronomy, and highfalutin stuff.

89
365
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,994
This is not going to work.

90
369
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:45,629
Your hormones are making you irrational and  violent.

91
373
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,050
Let's talk when you are calm.

92
377
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,200
Sorry, I can't take you home.

93
381
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,950
Did you even love me?

94
385
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:16,430
You've never told me you loved me,
the three years we've been together.

95
390
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Did you love me?

96
394
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,900
I loved you.

97
398
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,450
I loved you. The girl with chubby cheeks.

98
402
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,000
The one who said she would become the world's best patisserie.

99
406
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,750
The girl who searched all over Paris for a bakery.
I loved her.

100
411
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,335
She had lots of dreams, was outgoing, and determined,

101
415
00:08:58,335 --> 00:09:02,000
who always carried a sweet, sugary scent with her.

102
419
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,200
I loved her.

103
423
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,935
But my love stops here.

104
427
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:10,085
If you ask why it stops here...

105
431
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,200
What am I supposed to say?

106
435
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sorry... It's only up to now.

107
439
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,200
Hyun Woo... Don't forget me.

108
443
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,100
I don't mind dying...

109
447
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,510
But I can't take not being in your thoughts.

110
451
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:15,600
You have to be happy.

111
455
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,547
I love you, Hyun Woo.

112
459
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:20,205
You thought I'd say this!

113
463
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,700
Look straight into my eyes.

114
467
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,815
I'm going to follow you forever with these eyes.

115
471
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:27,890
I'm going to appear in your dreams every night.

116
475
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,500
When I found out you were cheating on me,

117
479
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,822
do you know how much I cried? Now it's your turn.

118
483
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:33,194
Try suffering for once.

119
487
00:10:33,194 --> 00:10:35,805
See how painful it is. 
And think to yourself.

120
492
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:39,088
Why did I leave this girl? You will regret it forever.

121
496
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:40,707
You call this love?

122
500
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:44,323
I'm not sorry. Goodbye.

123
504
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:46,855
I loved you until I was about to go crazy.

124
508
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,347
You bastard.

125
512
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,000
What good would it be?

126
516
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,766
Even if my parents die... 
 I will be too busy working and living.

127
521
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:19,400
And if his girlfriend leaves him,

128
525
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,600
we will be alike.

129
529
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,900
What can I do?
What will make him remember me forever?

130
534
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,786
There was a time

131
538
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:57,230
when I was on the top of the world.

132
542
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:03,675
It felt as if I was walking on clouds.
My heart was always pounding.

133
547
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:06,210
That was a good feeling,

134
551
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,400
as if our love filled up to the skies.

135
555
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:19,519
A man came who gave me that happiness,
but he left, just like that.

136
560
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,706
I'm crying right now,
not because I lost him.

137
565
00:13:24,706 --> 00:13:27,242
Love...

138
569
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:31,345
The thing that was burning once,

139
573
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:39,400
is now lost and gone.
I am crying because I understand that.

140
578
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,680
Because love without any power is pitiful, I'm crying.

141
582
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,134
Someone's in here.

142
586
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,364
There is someone in here.

143
590
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:33,948
I said, there's someone in here.

144
594
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:42,900
Are you deaf? There's someone in here!

145
598
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:50,100
I just got dumped, so I can't see anything! Just go away!

146
602
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:07,946
What are you, lady?

147
606
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:10,164
A pervert ?

148
610
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:17,334
Or... are you just taking a break in the men's bathroom?

149
614
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,800
Usually, if a guy sleeps with another girl, the game is over.

150
618
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:58,700
Next time don't ask him the reason why.

151
622
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Just leave him and end it.

152
626
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:08,188
In life, there are all kinds of men, but all of them are men.

153
630
00:16:08,188 --> 00:16:10,550
The same with women.

154
634
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,134
<i>It's been a while since you changed.</i>

155
638
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:20,300
If I called you, youâd hang up. You wouldn't return my texts,

156
642
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,175
<i>and you said you're busy because you didn't want to see me.</i>

157
646
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:24,230
<i>Oh...she doesn't get the hint.</i>

158
650
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,637
<i>If he doesn't answer her calls, it's already over.</i>

159
654
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:27,950
<i>Am I right ?</i>

160
658
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,751
<i>That's, that.</i>

161
662
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:30,900
<i>Your job.</i>

162
666
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,300
<i>It must be fun.</i>

163
670
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,800
<i>Do we work for fun?
We work to eat and live.</i>

164
675
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,800
<i>Yes.</i>

165
679
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,100
<i>But when are you thinking about going back to the hotel?</i>

166
683
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,800
<i>Your mother seems to be looking forward to it a lot.</i>

167
687
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,250
<i>Then, let's break up.</i>

168
691
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,300
<i>Oh no... that guy says they should break up first.</i>

169
695
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,370
<i>Don't you like me?</i>

170
699
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
<i>Did you just realize this now?</i>

171
703
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,970
<i>That woman earlier, do you love her?<i></i></i>

172
707
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,800
<i>That's nothing for you to know.</i>

173
711
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,120
<i>But, why?</i>

174
715
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,980
<i>In the past when I cursed you, you thought it was cool and fun, you bastard.</i>

175
719
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,700
<i>Every time I cursed you, you said it was stimulating, you vermin!</i>

176
723
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,964
<i>You don't know the rumors about you, do you?</i>

177
727
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,800
<i>You overdo things, and are uncouth.</i>

178
731
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,150
<i>If you don't want to date, then work it out with your mother.</i>

179
735
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,727
<i>And don't make girls waste their time.</i>

180
739
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:38,470
<i>Did you even love me?</i>

181
743
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,980
<i>The three years we were together, you never told me you loved me.</i>

182
747
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,950
<i>Did you love me?<i></i></i>

183
751
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,300
Hello! How are you? Hello!

184
755
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,360
Hello! Hello.

185
759
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:49,043
Good morning.

186
763
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:51,415
It's not a good morning.

187
767
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:54,142
Yang Mi just left for Paris this morning.

188
771
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:57,150
Her mother died of a heart attack.

189
775
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,826
When did she say she can come back?

190
779
00:19:58,826 --> 00:19:59,727
That's the problem.

191
783
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:01,538
She's not coming back.

192
787
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,900
Ah, what do we do?

193
791
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,670
Hello. Welcome.

194
795
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,303
Hi, I'm Kim Sam Soon.

195
799
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,082
They're waiting for you.

196
803
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:41,000
Your father is not around, out of 3 siblings you are the 3rd daughter.

197
807
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,300
Do you have a parent?

198
811
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
--Yes, my mother.
-- Mother...

199
816
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:51,182
You went to Le Cordon Bleu, and you... what is this?

200
820
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:58,409
Oh, that is a cooking school in Paris. It's been there for over 100 years, and I studied there.

201
824
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:04,100
Anyway, you don't have a job? Monthly income ...  Monthly income is zero?

202
828
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,541
Oh that is... right now I'm resting.

203
832
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:11,408
But I usually get called to work, so I'm going to be getting a job very soon.

204
836
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:13,700
So Kim Sam Soon.

205
840
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:18,536
Your name is a little... haha weird.

206
844
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:21,200
Did you fix your face?

207
848
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,376
100% natural.

208
852
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:25,620
Look at this. Look at this. You have no conscience.

209
856
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,832
How can you live in this century without doing anything to your face?

210
860
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:31,610
What?!

211
864
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,221
What kind of company is this?!

212
868
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:39,521
Do you think you can get married like this?

213
872
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:41,225
Here, watch this movie,

214
876
00:21:41,225 --> 00:21:47,371
In this movie it says a woman over 30 has the same chance of getting hit by a nuclear bomb as getting married.

215
880
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:50,723
Out of all the famous sayings, you can consider this the best.

216
884
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:53,437
Whatever you said before, it didn't go into my head.

217
888
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:58,414
Anyway, why don't you go home, wash your feet and watch this movie...

218
892
00:21:58,414 --> 00:22:02,938
and don't even dream about getting married.

219
896
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:11,734
If they were to remake this movie now, they would change 30 to 40 years old.

220
900
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,600
Today's 30 is the new 20.

221
904
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:24,224
That's what women think, but you have to realize men think differently.

222
908
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:28,459
Women HAVE to be pretty and young.

223
912
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,400
Oh is that right?

224
916
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,452
Do you men not get old too?

225
920
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:37,843
Does your stomach not droop down?

226
924
00:22:37,843 --> 00:22:40,753
Think positive, you old man.

227
928
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:44,166
And, I'm fat?

228
932
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:47,138
Yah! I am fat, making cakes and chocolate is my job

229
936
00:22:47,138 --> 00:22:48,493
Do you think I wouldn't be?!

230
940
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:52,116
And you say I'm a person with no job?

231
944
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:53,902
Is that my fault?! Is it ?

232
948
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,100
People like you, tell them all to come out!

233
952
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:14,891
Yes, I came to a conclusion that we should register you for the special care management division.

234
956
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:17,512
What does that mean?

235
960
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:23,088
Until you can get chosen, we will keep on supplying male candidates without limit.

236
964
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:29,544
So without limit means it will be very expensive?

237
968
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,100
Yes, of course. But how much is an investment for a "marriage for life" worth?

238
972
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,383
How much will it be?

239
976
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,900
It will be 9.99 million won.

240
980
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,610
What kind of dream was that.

241
984
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,600
<i>Be prepared for that special person just for you.
 Good Friend</i>

242
989
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:13,406
What... giving 9,990,000 won to those people, and they don't know how long I have to wait?

243
993
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:17,788
Ha... that's nonsense.

244
997
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,101
You're going to buy a bakery for our needs?

245
1001
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:30,707
She said she will not come back to work again because of her mother's death.

246
1005
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:36,042
Until we can get a new pastry chef, we will need to borrow theirs.

247
1009
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:40,837
Our restaurant is one of the top 5 in Seoul because it's high quality and expensive.

248
1013
00:24:40,837 --> 00:24:43,440
For now, we will not have any profits.

249
1017
00:24:43,464 --> 00:24:49,435
We need to go to the hotel,
and get a French chef for our restaurant.

250
1022
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:55,030
One more thing, the owner and kitchen workers are also French.

251
1026
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,036
Anyway, they don't fit our needs so we can't use them.

252
1030
00:24:58,036 --> 00:25:00,040
And you're not even making the food,

253
1034
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,901
so why do you need a patisserie?

254
1038
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,010
So is it not surprising this company is laughing at you?

255
1042
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,787
In France bakery goods are like kimchi here.

256
1046
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:10,218
I don't make fake food.

257
1050
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:14,154
You are showing off because you're overconfident.

258
1054
00:25:19,802 --> 00:25:26,213
Next week, Kim Ho Jang's daughter is getting married 
to the eldest son of Keelung Construction.

259
1059
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:30,789
The lady you were with last Christmas eve.

260
1063
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,100
I don't have to go, do I?

261
1067
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,290
When the heck  are you planning to get married?

262
1071
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,567
Next year Mi Joo starts kindergarten.

263
1075
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,476
Don't you think we need an aunt to take her to school?

264
1079
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:49,797
I will do that, and I will go to the parent meetings, feed her, do whatever necessary. 
So please stop these blind dates.

265
1084
00:25:49,797 --> 00:25:51,849
If you don't want to go on blind dates,
then get married.

266
1089
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:55,409
We're almost there. Please give me the pastries.

267
1093
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:59,042
I already told you this before, but Chris said we can't. So there's nothing I can do about it.

268
1097
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,700
Chris likes me, so just give him a call.

269
1101
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,773
You jerk, when are you going to get your act together?

270
1105
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:15,664
Hey, what do you think people will say about a 5-star hotel owner's son leaving and opening his own restaurant?

271
1109
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:18,420
Mom runs the inn while the son does food jobs.

272
1113
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,026
What? Are you making jokes about your mother?

273
1117
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:25,894
Hey, mamma's boy, do you think
you can do this on your own?

274
1122
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:28,184
If you keep hitting me, I don't think
I can hold it in any longer!

275
1127
00:26:28,184 --> 00:26:36,389
What?! What are you going to do, huh?
What are you going to do?

276
1132
00:26:41,993 --> 00:26:46,650
You... what are you going to do?! What? What are you doing?

277
1136
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,290
You brat!

278
1140
00:26:50,294 --> 00:26:54,413
Ohh, let go!  You're not going to let go?

279
1144
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:58,803
Ohh... why did you suddenly shrink?

280
1148
00:27:07,938 --> 00:27:10,698
If you don't have luck with your husband, I heard you don't have luck with your child.

281
1152
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:12,446
Instead you have luck with money.

282
1156
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:15,425
Oh... I can't live because of you.  You're so disgusting.

283
1160
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,106
I wonder where you came from.

284
1164
00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:19,912
From beneath President Na's legs.

285
1168
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:22,675
Get married before the end of this year.

286
1172
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,300
Hurry and give Chris a call.

287
1176
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,900
I'm going to tell on you to your older brother.

288
1180
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,000
Tell him I said hi.

289
1184
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,100
There's nothing wrong with President Na, right?

290
1188
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,400
Not really.

291
1192
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,000
How much longer are you going to be riding in the taxi?

292
1196
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:47,696
If you're still afraid to drive, why don't you get a personal driver like your mother said.

293
1200
00:27:47,696 --> 00:27:50,561
It's okay, it's better than you think.

294
1204
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,434
You've been working at a very good place for 2-3 years.

295
1208
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,550
Hmm, how should I put this...

296
1212
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:19,743
Should I say that the work is different than the life that I'm living in?

297
1216
00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:21,711
What do you mean by life?

298
1220
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,100
um... That is.

299
1224
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:29,590
I think the person making the food becomes a part of the food.

300
1228
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,065
So that means...that

301
1232
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:40,352
I think that in order to make a good cake, 
 I must support the quality of my life. So

302
1237
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,480
I took some time off at Christmas Eve to protect the one I loved.

303
1241
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,600
Well, it's my values and perspective on the world.

304
1245
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:57,574
A girl who lost her love wouldn't be able to make a sweet cake.

305
1249
00:28:57,574 --> 00:29:06,881
So on the busiest day at the bakery, you didn't stay because you wanted to go play with the one you love. So you got fired.

306
1253
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:11,422
No, no, no, not to play around.  It was to protect the love.

307
1257
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:13,080
So did you protect it?

308
1261
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,791
No... we broke up.

309
1265
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:19,295
Impressive.

310
1269
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,600
Thank you.

311
1273
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,500
This is mango mousse, to show you my work.

312
1277
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:29,418
No that's fine,

313
1281
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:33,938
We're looking for an assistant,
but you don't quite have the background for it.

314
1286
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,900
I guess not this time. I'm sorry.

315
1290
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,380
What is this... one place says I have too much history. Another place says I have too little history.

316
1294
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,300
What kind of place can I fit in?

317
1298
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,100
Are you going in or not?

318
1302
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:03,626
Mister... my hair, my hair.

319
1306
00:31:03,626 --> 00:31:05,323
Hang on a second. Your hair is stuck.

320
1310
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:07,635
Yes, gently please.

321
1314
00:31:07,635 --> 00:31:10,277
Ahh! Mister, why are you pulling on it!

322
1318
00:31:10,277 --> 00:31:11,543
Stay still.

323
1322
00:31:11,543 --> 00:31:12,388
But you're hurting my hair!

324
1326
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,100
Just stay still, will you?!

325
1330
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,800
Why do you have to yell?

326
1334
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,300
Just shut your mouth and stay still.

327
1338
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:23,426
Shut my mouth?

328
1342
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,500
You're telling me to shut my mouth?! Shut my mouth?!

329
1346
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,223
Give me some scissors, please.

330
1350
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,900
Are you crazy? Are you crazy?

331
1354
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,347
What do you mean scissors?

332
1358
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:43,727
See what happens if you use the scissors.

333
1362
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:44,820
Don't you have scissors?

334
1366
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,043
What do you mean scissors!

335
1370
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,380
I'll get it free.

336
1374
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:50,748
Sorry, but I don't have time.
I'll just cut it off.

337
1379
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,600
Hold on! STOP!

338
1383
00:31:54,022 --> 00:31:57,722
See what happens if you cut my hair. I'll sue you.

339
1387
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:21,973
You're not an employee here, right?

340
1391
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:25,520
Sue me if you want.
 I'll sue you for spying on us.

341
1396
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,091
Did you get my message, Chris?

342
1400
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:35,974
I got it, but I can't do it today.

343
1404
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:37,727
We can start tomorrow.

344
1408
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:40,705
That won't do. We barely made it through lunch.

345
1412
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:47,239
Come on Chris. 
 I'm sorry it's impossible. It's not like I can give you the goods from our deli.

346
1417
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:50,158
Come on, Chris. Just enough to cover dinner. 
That's all.

347
1422
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:52,088
I can't.

348
1426
00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:05,677
Oh my god!

349
1430
00:33:05,677 --> 00:33:08,604
I'm the type of person who can't see people like you.

350
1434
00:33:09,606 --> 00:33:14,035
I made this cake, and it's expensive.
But I'm not charging you for it.

351
1439
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,300
Eat it well!

352
1443
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,700
Mr. Hyun, are you okay?

353
1447
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:40,280
He should know not to cut Samson's hair!

354
1451
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,516
What a jerk!

355
1455
00:33:52,005 --> 00:33:55,687
Mister... I wasn't talking about you, but someone else...

356
1459
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,800
Do you want what happened last Christmas Eve to happen again?

357
1463
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,200
In life there are all kinds of men, but men are men.

358
1467
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:18,560
What... there are all kinds of men? 
Well, there are all kinds of women, too.

359
1472
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:26,561
Anyway, if he went on that long,
he should know I would start, too.

360
1477
00:35:28,063 --> 00:35:32,231
But wait... now that I think about it, he's pretty young.

361
1481
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:37,040
Even if he dated, how much would he know! Anyway ...

362
1485
00:35:40,996 --> 00:35:42,588
You there...

363
1489
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,800
Why is he following me?

364
1493
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,200
Hey you...you there!

365
1497
00:35:57,608 --> 00:35:59,880
Mister, hurry. Hurry please!

366
1501
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,500
What are you doing? Hurry!

367
1505
00:36:04,323 --> 00:36:06,041
Let's talk.

368
1509
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,877
Why are you not driving?! Hurry!

369
1513
00:36:07,877 --> 00:36:09,605
Get out for a minute.
It will be only a minute.

370
1518
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,400
Mister!
What is this guy trying to do?

371
1523
00:36:18,484 --> 00:36:19,943
Hurry up and get out!

372
1527
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,100
Where is this madam going?

373
1531
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,200
What do you mean madam? Who's the madam?

374
1535
00:36:25,235 --> 00:36:27,595
Is it really important whether or not I call you a miss or a madam?

375
1539
00:36:27,595 --> 00:36:29,023
Of course, it's important.

376
1543
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,800
I'm not old, nor do I have wrinkles. So where do you get madam from?!

377
1547
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,796
Mister, please go where this Miss is going.

378
1551
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,542
Mister, I don't agree with him.

379
1555
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:42,400
She agrees. I'm her younger brother.

380
1559
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,680
The cake a while ago... you said you made it yourself right?

381
1563
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,830
Are you doing this just to ask that question?

382
1567
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,300
Did you really make it yourself?

383
1571
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,200
Whatever.

384
1575
00:37:01,563 --> 00:37:03,617
I don't have time to fool around right now.

385
1579
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,500
Did you make it yourself? Yes or no.

386
1583
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:08,252
I made it myself.

387
1587
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:09,772
Is it your hobby, making cakes?

388
1591
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:11,255
No.

389
1595
00:37:11,255 --> 00:37:13,100
It's my job.

390
1599
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,800
Pastry chef?

391
1603
00:37:15,682 --> 00:37:17,841
How do you know?

392
1607
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,500
Most people have no clue.

393
1611
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:24,342
Where do you work right now?

394
1615
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,000
Bakery, hotel, or your own shop?

395
1619
00:37:29,628 --> 00:37:36,741
That is... I'm not, well...
 So right now, I'm taking a break

396
1624
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,200
Here, take this.

397
1628
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,314
Why should I?

398
1632
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:48,872
Just take it, nothing bad is going to happen.

399
1636
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,300
No, I don't want to.

400
1640
00:37:51,351 --> 00:37:54,095
You'll regret it if you don't take it.

401
1644
00:37:54,095 --> 00:37:56,783
If you don't get off this taxi, you regret it.

402
1648
00:37:56,783 --> 00:38:00,278
Mister, stop here please. This man is getting out.

403
1652
00:38:02,796 --> 00:38:04,301
What are you doing?

404
1656
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,800
Let go!

405
1660
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,056
Since you have it, why don't you just look at it?

406
1664
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,000
Why should I?

407
1668
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,300
To a girl, her hair is very important!

408
1672
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:24,117
Oh, really!

409
1676
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,768
<i>Bon Appetit Restaurant,
President Hyun Jin Hun</i>

410
1681
00:38:38,514 --> 00:38:44,373
Come by tomorrow at 3 with your resumÃ©,
and bring a variety of cakes and cookies.

411
1686
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:01,206
I don't like it when people use Korea time, so don't be late.

412
1690
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:03,200
Be on time at 3.

413
1694
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:15,287
I am busy tomorrow.

414
1698
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:18,430
I need to find a place to bake, and get all the ingredients.

415
1702
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,086
Where do you usually bake?

416
1706
00:39:20,086 --> 00:39:22,439
Someone I know has a bakery school.

417
1710
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:23,704
Today and tomorrow are weekends.

418
1714
00:39:23,704 --> 00:39:25,457
Do they have classes on weekends, too?

419
1718
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:27,956
I still need to get the ingredients.

420
1722
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:32,943
Even though I can get most of them, there are few that are hard to find.

421
1726
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:34,685
Just make it with whatever ingredients you can get

422
1730
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,400
because it will show if you're a real chef or not.

423
1734
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,620
Wait a moment. Wait a moment.

424
1738
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,640
Excuse me.

425
1742
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,300
Just a minute... how old are you?

426
1746
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:56,368
You look young...
so you might be a con artist.

427
1751
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,200
Did you just laugh at me?

428
1755
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,245
No.

429
1759
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,400
You just laughed at me.

430
1763
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:10,246
You can go now.

431
1767
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,500
Hey you!

432
1771
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,800
That jerk.

433
1775
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:42,112
Did you use Photoshop?

434
1779
00:40:42,112 --> 00:40:43,662
Yes.

435
1783
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:46,736
Next time, don't. You look like a different person.

436
1787
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,878
You name is Kim Sam Soon.

437
1791
00:40:48,878 --> 00:40:51,800
You are a bit old.

438
1795
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,600
So?

439
1799
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,100
Never mind. Continue reading...

440
1803
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:08,000
Went to school in Paris and worked as an intern for 2 years.

441
1807
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,900
If you went to study in Paris, why didn't you go to college?

442
1811
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,359
I didn't do well in my studies.

443
1815
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,500
Then how did you manage to stay in that school?

444
1819
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:25,814
In this world there are three ways to communicate.

445
1823
00:41:25,814 --> 00:41:29,238
Music, art, and food.

446
1827
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:30,882
Then why did you come back?

447
1831
00:41:30,882 --> 00:41:33,728
You could have tried to stay and study there.

448
1835
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:37,794
My father past away suddenly

449
1839
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:41,153
because there was something wrong with his heart.

450
1843
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:53,129
<i>I'm sure he doesn't remember me. 
If he did, he wouldn't be like this.</i>

451
1848
00:41:53,129 --> 00:41:58,405
<i>He can't remember who I am, but something is off.</i>

452
1852
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,600
<i>Everyone who sees my name laughs,
except for him...</i>

453
1857
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:22,740
â« <i>Oh, the shark, Babe, has such teeth, Dear</i> â«

454
1861
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:28,600
â« <i>And he shows them... pearly white.</i> â«

455
1865
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:34,390
â«<i> Just a jackknife,  has old MacHeath, Babe? </i>â«

456
1869
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:38,630
â« <i> And he keeps it, out of sight. </i>â«

457
1873
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,750
â«<i> You know when that shark bites... with his teeth, Babe. </i>â«

458
1877
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:49,120
â«<i> Scarlet billows... start to spread </i>â«

459
1881
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:55,390
â« <i> Fancy gloves though ...wears old MacHeath, Babe, </i>â«

460
1885
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:00,760
â«<i> So there's never, never a trace of red. </i>â«

461
1889
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:06,340
â« <i> Now on a sidewalk, Oh Sunday mornin'  a ha.</i> â«

462
1893
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:12,240
â« <i> Lies a body... just oozin' life </i> â«

463
1897
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,810
â« <i> Some, someone's sneakin'... 'round a corner </i>â«

464
1901
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:23,590
â«<i> Could that someone, be Old Mack the Knife? </i>â«

465
1905
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:28,723
â«<i> There's a tugboat down by the river ... </i>â«

466
1909
00:43:28,723 --> 00:43:33,838
Now... this is Castella cake, Madaleine, macaroon, bonbon...

467
1913
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:38,669
But the appearance is very simple.

468
1917
00:43:38,669 --> 00:43:40,435
Because I couldn't get all the ingredients I needed,

469
1921
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,300
I made it with whatever I could.

470
1925
00:43:44,312 --> 00:43:46,400
I got the interview just yesterday.

471
1929
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,622
It would have been better if I had more time.

472
1933
00:43:48,622 --> 00:43:50,803
No, it's not that.

473
1937
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,700
The appearance didn't change the taste of the cake,

474
1941
00:43:55,737 --> 00:43:58,023
but the cake is very good, excellent job.

475
1945
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,558
Thank you.

476
1949
00:44:00,558 --> 00:44:04,118
Also, the chocolate and the case.

477
1953
00:44:04,118 --> 00:44:07,700
The taste was very different.
Did you personally make the case?

478
1958
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,600
Yes.

479
1962
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,024
Putting my homemade chocolate into the case

480
1966
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,900
I made, is a basic principal to me.

481
1970
00:44:13,923 --> 00:44:16,559
Oh really? Why is that?

482
1974
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Inside the chocolate case is the life of a person.

483
1978
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,900
Have you ever seen the movie <i>Forrest Gump?</i>

484
1982
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,626
In the movie, the main character's mother once said,

485
1986
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:29,947
"Life was like a box of chocolates."

486
1990
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:33,470
"You never know what you're gonna get."

487
1994
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,291
You don't remember that?

488
1998
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:35,483
I haven't watched it.

489
2002
00:44:35,483 --> 00:44:37,724
If you have time, you should watch it.

490
2006
00:44:37,724 --> 00:44:42,072
Anyway, my becoming a pastry chef was unplanned.

491
2010
00:44:42,072 --> 00:44:47,348
Once, I went to a library and there, without thinking, I pulled out a book,

492
2014
00:44:47,348 --> 00:44:50,315
and that book was about French baking.

493
2018
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:54,028
If that book was about taking care of baby chickens,

494
2022
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,800
who knows if I would be taking care of baby chickens right now.

495
2026
00:45:03,557 --> 00:45:09,915
Now whatever I pick up, changes this. 
It changes it very much.

496
2031
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:14,644
So, all the chocolates you've made so far, have all of them been good?

497
2035
00:45:14,644 --> 00:45:19,224
No, there were good ones, and there were bad ones.

498
2039
00:45:19,224 --> 00:45:21,186
However, there's nothing we can do about it.

499
2043
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:25,471
That circumstance is mine, and all the chocolate in it, I had to eat anyway.

500
2047
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:29,981
When and what I eat, that makes the difference.

501
2051
00:45:29,981 --> 00:45:33,509
But things might have been different.

502
2055
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:37,604
When I was a child, I didn't have any fear and just ate everything I saw.

503
2059
00:45:37,604 --> 00:45:43,211
But now... I think a lot and sit picking which one to eat.

504
2063
00:45:43,211 --> 00:45:48,391
I know now that some chocolates have bitter rum in them.

505
2067
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:56,448
If I I wish for anything, I wish there wouldn't be anymore chocolate with bitter rum in it.

506
2071
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,100
Because for 30 years, I've eaten them
and finished them.

507
2076
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:00,644
That's all.

508
2080
00:46:00,644 --> 00:46:02,403
Since you figured that out so early,

509
2084
00:46:02,403 --> 00:46:06,720
it's like saying the chocolate made with bitter rum is split in half.

510
2088
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,110
Yes.

511
2092
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,400
Is there anything more you need to ask?

512
2096
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,900
No?  There isn't.

513
2100
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,446
Okay, let's work together.

514
2104
00:46:16,446 --> 00:46:19,425
Work starts at 10 a.m and ends at 10 p.m.

515
2108
00:46:19,425 --> 00:46:21,629
The bakery is earlier than the others.

516
2112
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:23,449
Oh, she seems to know already.

517
2116
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,400
Work starts at 7 am and ends at 8 pm.
 Depending on the situation, it might end later.

518
2121
00:46:28,643 --> 00:46:35,712
From 3 to 5 pm, it's time to get ready for dinner. 
 Cleaning is every other third Monday.

519
2126
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:38,762
Also, every three months is when we promote an employee to a higher position.

520
2130
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,800
-Hold on. 
 =Yes?

521
2135
00:46:41,347 --> 00:46:43,187
I have one condition.

522
2139
00:46:43,187 --> 00:46:44,819
A condition?

523
2143
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,600
Yes, there is a condition.

524
2147
00:46:50,793 --> 00:46:57,061
Just to tell you, our restaurant does not copy other restaurant's food.

525
2151
00:46:57,061 --> 00:47:00,329
Our main chef here is Korean, but has been working

526
2155
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:03,739
for a French hotel for 15 years until he came here.

527
2159
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,900
Please have a seat.

528
2163
00:47:05,915 --> 00:47:09,594
The pastry chef was also here, but had to leave because of certain matters.

529
2167
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:15,396
Of course, we know that you studied in Paris, but that is not enough.

530
2171
00:47:15,396 --> 00:47:16,871
Are you finished yet?

531
2175
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:18,745
Don't think too much like I'm the boss.

532
2179
00:47:18,745 --> 00:47:20,513
We have a comfortable environment here.

533
2183
00:47:20,513 --> 00:47:21,649
Are you finished now?

534
2187
00:47:21,649 --> 00:47:23,569
For now, work for 3 months.

535
2191
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:28,088
We will see whether or not you can work in a regular position then.

536
2195
00:47:28,088 --> 00:47:29,748
So... that means I can get fired?

537
2199
00:47:29,748 --> 00:47:32,536
If you don't have the skills, is that not necessary?

538
2203
00:47:32,536 --> 00:47:35,999
Agreed. Let's do it like that.

539
2207
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:38,374
Can I talk now?

540
2211
00:47:38,374 --> 00:47:40,181
I'd like it if you can start tomorrow.

541
2215
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:42,998
I said I had one condition.

542
2219
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,100
Say what the condition is.

543
2223
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,900
Change Kim Sam Soon to Kim Hee Jin please.

544
2227
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:58,400
Change the name Kim Sam Soon to Kim Hee Jin.

545
2231
00:47:59,058 --> 00:48:05,243
I mean... it doesn't cost any money, and it's just to the employees here.

546
2235
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,400
You can do that can't you since you're the president here?

547
2239
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,258
Why would I have to do that? 
What do you mean why?

548
2244
00:48:10,258 --> 00:48:13,502
Why do we need to call Kim Sam Soon as Kim Hee Jin?

549
2248
00:48:13,502 --> 00:48:19,203
Then... would you like it if we called you Sam Shik?

550
2252
00:48:19,203 --> 00:48:22,055
My name isn't Hyun Jin Hun, but it's Hyun Sam Shik.

551
2256
00:48:22,055 --> 00:48:24,408
But, I am not Sam Shik.

552
2260
00:48:24,408 --> 00:48:25,696
Who doesn't know that?

553
2264
00:48:25,696 --> 00:48:27,331
Then why do you ask?

554
2268
00:48:27,331 --> 00:48:29,116
You're messing around with me, aren't you?

555
2272
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:30,676
Why would I?

556
2276
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,000
This is unreal.

557
2280
00:48:34,231 --> 00:48:36,246
Then let's do this.

558
2284
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,196
I can understand why you want to change your name,

559
2288
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,171
but, you can choose any name but Hee Jin.

560
2292
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:45,148
Why are you taking out the name Hee Jin?

561
2296
00:48:45,148 --> 00:48:50,040
Kim Sam Soon, Kim Hee Jin. Take out those two names. You can choose any name.

562
2300
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,937
Why does that have to be like that?

563
2304
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,400
You don't need to know that.

564
2308
00:48:55,100 --> 00:49:00,000
No! I have to be Kim Hee Jin.

565
2312
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,045
And just as you said, you don't need to know the reason for it either.

566
2316
00:49:04,045 --> 00:49:06,332
I don't like it when people copy what I say.

567
2320
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,900
Same with me.

568
2324
00:49:08,932 --> 00:49:14,564
Call me Kim Hee Jin or go find yourself another pastry chef.

569
2328
00:49:31,893 --> 00:49:34,339
Forget it. I'll give up.

570
2332
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,300
Go find another pastry chef.

571
2336
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,200
Kim Hee Jin.

572
2340
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,500
Kim Hee Jin.

573
2344
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,000
What is it, boss?

574
2348
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,900
Out of all names, why does it ...

575
2352
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Why does it what?

576
2356
00:50:03,174 --> 00:50:05,812
Why, out of all names, does it have to be Kim Hee Jin?

577
2360
00:50:08,198 --> 00:50:11,167
Do you want to know?

578
2364
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,000
Yes, I want to know.

579
2368
00:50:14,603 --> 00:50:18,427
I want to know why you want to know.

580
2372
00:50:18,427 --> 00:50:20,836
That's a private answer, so I can't tell you that.

581
2376
00:50:20,836 --> 00:50:24,088
Oh... I see.

582
2380
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:28,791
Same with me, but I'll tell you anyway.

583
2384
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:33,721
However... I'll tell you when I become a full time employee.

584
2388
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,000
Okay?

585
2392
00:50:56,602 --> 00:51:01,944
This is too much for me to drink myself. 
Would you like a drink?

586
2397
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,600
Sure.

587
2401
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:15,425
Do you know how they measure the reflection of rocks in a Rorschach test?

588
2405
00:51:17,103 --> 00:51:21,135
You put in a 30 cm white disc in the water

589
2409
00:51:21,135 --> 00:51:26,349
until it goes deep into the mud until you can't see it.

590
2413
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,700
That's how you measure it.

591
2417
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,950
In this country do you know how many meters the reflection in the reservoir of the tallest dam is?

592
2421
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:36,778
How many meters?

593
2425
00:51:36,778 --> 00:51:42,293
In Japan a dam called Mashyu, 42.6 meters.

594
2429
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,700
Secondly, in Russia it's called the Vyka dam, 40.5 meters.

595
2433
00:51:52,031 --> 00:51:57,762
But, you can't measure the reflections in a person's heart.

596
2437
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,500
But I figured out to some degree.

597
2441
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,785
Up to now, it was a divorced lady speaking.

598
2445
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,300
So what did you do in America for 3 years?

599
2449
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,570
I learned many things.

600
2453
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,500
Particularly?

601
2457
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,200
I should become the best doctor.

602
2461
00:52:23,209 --> 00:52:24,916
You're a doctor?

603
2465
00:52:24,916 --> 00:52:26,884
I'm still a student.

604
2469
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,800
That's so refined. So you're going to medical school?

605
2473
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,900
No, it's not that.

606
2477
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,300
But ... have you noticed that guy over there has been staring at us?

607
2481
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:42,909
I've noticed, too.

608
2485
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,900
But aren't you curious who he's looking at between the two of us?

609
2489
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,446
Uhmmm ...

610
2493
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,800
Hello, I'm Yoo Hee Jin.

611
2497
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:16,219
From earlier,  you've been looking at us.

612
2501
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,268
So?

613
2505
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,400
I was wondering out of us two, who you were looking at?

614
2509
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:28,400
I looked because you were being so loud.

615
2513
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,200
What kind of actions are those on a plane?

616
2517
00:53:59,681 --> 00:54:03,090
Hee Jin, I didn't think you were like that.

617
2521
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:07,600
And you went up and asked him. What the?

618
2525
00:54:10,678 --> 00:54:13,967
I'm so glad I got to come back.

619
2529
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,200
When I left 3 years ago I thought I could never come back.

620
2533
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,000
By any chance... did you run away?

621
2537
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,470
How did you know?

622
2541
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:29,000
Welcome back.

623
2545
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:38,014
I'll introduce a new member to our family, who'll be working with us starting today.

624
2549
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:43,200
Our new pastry chef... Kim Sam-- Kim Hee Jin.

625
2553
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:01,274
<i>Ooh...! You cute fellows, just wait a bit.</i>

626
2557
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:07,000
<i>This noona will treat you well.</i>

627
2561
00:55:07,731 --> 00:55:10,413
Thank you for welcoming me.

628
2565
00:55:10,413 --> 00:55:12,593
I am Kim Hee Jin.

629
2569
00:55:12,593 --> 00:55:16,466
It's a great pleasure to be working with you all.

630
2573
00:55:16,466 --> 00:55:18,681
How old are you?

631
2577
00:55:23,734 --> 00:55:25,140
Does age really matter?

632
2581
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:28,800
Of course, so we know what to call you.

633
2585
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,900
I'm 30.

634
2589
00:55:33,857 --> 00:55:36,133
The half of 60.

635
2593
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:38,374
Oh, you're two years older than I am.

636
2597
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,200
You're the oldest out of us all.

637
2601
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:45,609
Let's all clap for the unnie with the oldest age.

638
2605
00:56:06,498 --> 00:56:08,266
You are all dead.
