<i>Episode 10
My name is Kim Hee Jin</i>

2
8
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:24,599
Take this, it will be a big help to you.

3
12
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:38,061
I don't want to say good-byes,
so don't follow me out.

4
17
00:00:40,486 --> 00:00:41,568
Don't come out!

5
21
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:27,334
I'm sorry, I should have endured it.

6
25
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:30,469
No, it is not your fault. Don't blame yourself.

7
29
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:34,018
How are we going to do our business?

8
33
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:44,337
I think I will ask my mother for help. 
Like last time, to bring over from the baker 
or, for a pastry chef to come here.

9
39
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,323
It would be great if we could get a pastry chef.

10
43
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:48,933
I think so too.

11
47
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,328
If that works out, it would be great.

12
51
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:57,301
Sam Soon, is a great loss.

13
55
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:23,041
Watch the fire.

14
59
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,200
Yes.

15
63
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,080
You're here.

16
67
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
It's 5 minutes till 9, satisfied?

17
71
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey, hang on!

18
75
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,965
Why did Sam Soon resign so suddenly?

19
79
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:42,290
And why did your mother behave that way?

20
83
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,846
Don't try to know too much, it won't good for a lot of people.

21
87
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:48,947
Why do you shoot your words out like that? 
It's not like you're a jellyfish.

22
92
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:52,442
With who's permission, do you think you're leaving?
I need to check jeans first.

23
97
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:55,316
Wait for me while I try it on.

24
101
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:57,967
What is there to try?

25
105
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,772
What kind of a man is this?

26
109
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:05,000
Where is this place that
I must go with you too?

27
114
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,600
Did the whole family eat a woodpecker?  Why are you so loud.  Just follow me, you have nothing to lose.

28
118
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:18,848
What the hell is this!

29
122
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:22,111
If you borrowed my jeans for few days, 
shouldn't you buy me drinks?

30
127
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:23,679
Are you trying to seduce me?

31
131
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,905
Seduce? This innocent bachelor does
not know what seduction is..

32
136
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:29,745
I don't do that.
I will just court you right away.

33
141
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,400
What the...
 Hey, give me back my handbag!

34
146
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,700
How could you do this to me...
give me back my bag!

35
151
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,590
Come, drink.

36
155
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,500
Is what you needed to wear tonight at all cost, this?

37
159
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:52,449
This right here, every time I wear this,
it's a home run 100:100 win.

38
164
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:57,100
Did you seduce 100 women?  
Then, why is it that you couldn't get married?

39
169
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,000
I am divorcee.

40
173
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,700
Just like me.

41
177
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,800
Really?

42
181
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:11,184
Have you heard of any singles claiming they've been divorced?

43
185
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
You should have said so earlier!
I'm so happy to hear this.

44
190
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,296
I knew we had something in common.

45
194
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:23,715
There are some things you shouldn't have in common.
It's not like it's something to be proud of.

46
199
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:25,600
Well, it may not be something to be proud of, but ...

47
203
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,963
at least we won't ask each other why we got a divorce.
Why do you think people are so curious about that?

48
208
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:33,940
Whether it's because of personality difference or sexual preference.

49
212
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,574
That's true.

50
216
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:38,432
So why are you divorced?

64
275
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,889
There are 2 types of dough, depending on its use.

65
279
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,586
One with the yeast and one without.

66
283
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:31,377
If you add the yeast, it will ferment right away, but if that's not the case, the flour will breath and expand on it's own.

67
287
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,600
I find that really, really cute.
I should be a person without the yeast.

Increase your pay by 10%.

This guy is still not thinking straight.
Where does he get off showing off his money?

72
309
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,700

85
361

My father never thew things away thoughtlessly.

86
365
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,500
Leftovers were of course used as fertilisers.

87
369
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:50,759
After straining and drying well, he'd scatter them here.
Telling them to eat and to grow well.

88
374
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,800
If the vegetables that are grown by consuming these flowers 
come on the dinner table, I'll eat it well,

89
379
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,500
and forget about it completely.

90
383
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:25,072
Kim Sam Soon. 
Kim Sam Soon?

91
388
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,500
Were you waiting for Kim Sam Soon's call?

92
392
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,451
Jin Hyun?

93
396
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:38,475
Oh yes, there's stuff to discuss.

94
400
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,400
This late?

95
404
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,890
Yes.

96
408
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,700
It must've been important.

97
412
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:48,569
Kind of.

98
416
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:52,423
Where are you now?

99
420
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:54,701
I just got left work.

100
424
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,354
<i>It's very late.</i>

101
428
00:12:57,355 --> 00:13:00,846
I heard that tomorrow is Mi Joo's got physiotherapy.

102
432
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,600
I would like to go with her.

103
436
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:05,071
That'd be nice.

104
440
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:08,161
Then bring Mi Joo to my house .
Give me a call before you leave.

105
445
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,321
Okay.

106
449
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,139
Drive carefully.

107
453
00:13:26,714 --> 00:13:29,870
So, the contract ended and I arrived in Marseilles?

108
457
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:35,043
What do I do?  Starved but have no money. So I followed how we do it in Korea and barged into the market.

109
461
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,400
To find some odd jobs in exchange for food. But,

110
465
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:48,100
when you go to the marketplace in Korea, they put in fish heads and roughly chopped up vegetables, and add chili.

111
469
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:57,792
They have it there too! I could smell it, 
 and tears just came to my eyes.

112
474
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,900
Oh my.  Are you going to take all night?
So, did they give some to you?

113
479
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,556
Of course! Of course I ate.

114
483
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,800
A bowl of fish soup that touched my soul ... bouillabaisse.

115
487
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:20,243
As I was saying, I was working in this small restaurant in a small corner of the Marseilles night market,

116
491
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:26,514
and that was a long time ago. Now this is
important. That menu had this sentence.

117
496
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:34,700
"Tell me what you ate, and I can tell what kind of person you are."

118
500
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,800
Brillat-Savarin.

119
504
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,703
You know Savarin?

120
508
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,700
I have a sister who is a pastry chef. This is the least I should know.

121
512
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Isn't the  Savarin biscuit named after him?

122
516
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,448
You really know!

123
520
00:14:55,313 --> 00:14:59,733
Jeans, you have good taste.

124
524
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:06,039
How can that be? Such a pretty face,
a great figure, and smart too.

125
529
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:12,921
If Sabaran was here 
he would say, "Let's sleep together."

126
534
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:15,047
Hurry!

127
538
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,493
Why should I sleep with you?

128
542
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:24,251
Come on, just to fulfill basic instincts. What other reasons do you need?

129
546
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:29,547
I should have some justification. 
 No matter how much the world has changed ...

130
551
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:31,375
Give me 3 reasons.

131
555
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:37,470
Justice? I don't have a justice, but there's a flower pot.
Will that work?

132
560
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:47,399
You are so lame. Give me 3 reasons
why I should sleep with you.

133
565
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,214
This is crazy. Alright, three reasons,
just three right? First!

134
570
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,340
One.

135
574
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:57,820
You've worn my jeans.

136
578
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:01,306
Your cheap pair of jeans.

137
582
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:05,076
Secondly, we held hands. Doesn't holding
of hands imply that you give the rest too?

138
587
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,000
You grabbed them, did I give them to you?

139
591
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,700
Third,

140
595
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:15,716
Third,

141
599
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:29,749
Third,  because there's one there.
You are dead tonight. Come with me.

142
604
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:06,786
<i>Sam Shik ...</i>

143
608
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:09,620
<i>Hey, Sam Shik!</i>

144
612
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,600
<i>Get up quickly. You have to eat, and then go to work.</i>

145
616
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:18,517
<i>Why are you so surprised?</i>

146
620
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:20,343
<i>Quickly wash up!</i>

147
624
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,100
<i>There, there ...  acting innocent again.  
Is this the first time you've seen me?</i>

148
629
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:30,908
<i>What is wrong with your fridge today?
You don't even have an egg in here.</i>

149
634
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:33,883
<i>Why are you surprised, you punk!</i>

150
638
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:40,513
<i>It may be difficult to believe, but accept the truth.
Because you dumped me, I became like this.</i>

151
643
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:50,169
<i>What are you doing?
 You are not thinking of throwing me away?</i>

152
648
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,638
<i>Sam Shik... Sam Shik... Sam Shik!</i>

153
652
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:04,964
<i>You dare to throw me out!</i>

154
656
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:10,590
<i>I will show you how big a price you have to pay for 
abandoning the miller's third daughter, Sam Soon.</i>

155
661
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,220
<i>I'll strip you naked.</i>

156
665
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Do you know how many people are named Ye Seuh?
(Jesus in Korean)

157
670
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,491
Two people.

158
674
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:47,741
There are four Jung Yi, and there are 300  No Sook Ja.  
(Homeless in Korean).

159
679
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,812
Heo Jun, 101.

160
683
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:53,249
There are 10,248, Chul Soo.
(old-fashioned Korean male name)

161
688
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:56,176
There are 29,227 Young Hee,
 (old-fashioned female Korean name)

162
693
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:01,441
There were also Pi Hae-ja ('victim' in Korean),  An Tae-na ('antenna'), Park Chi-gi ('head butting') Choo Gil-nyun ('bitch'), Choo Gi-ja ('Let's kill')

163
697
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,649
Chang Poong, Gang Ah-ji ('dog'), Go Yang-yi ('cat').

164
701
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:06,867
Oh my, there are those who are named cats and dogs?

165
705
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:10,808
Dog - Five; Cat - one

166
709
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Aren't those parents a little too irresponsible?

167
713
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:16,564
We have one here in front of us.

168
717
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:19,645
Are you talking about changing your name again?

169
721
00:19:19,645 --> 00:19:25,107
Last year, Lee Sam Soon born 1958 in Changwon changed his name to Lee Han.

170
725
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,300
To think that even one born in 1958,
resorted to changing his name to start fresh.

171
730
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:32,900
I am only 30. I want to change
my name, so don't stop me.

172
735
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,000
I won't. Do as you wish.

173
739
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:38,557
Mom, you are joking, right?

174
743
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,800
Both granddad and father objected. Why the sudden change?

175
747
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,051
You've used Kim Sam Soon and lived for 30 years,

176
751
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,693
for the rest of your days you can live it as your favorite,
Kim Hee Jin.

177
756
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:50,760
You are serious right?
Don't back out of your words.

178
761
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,534
I feel now that by changing your name, you will stop getting dumped.

179
765
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:56,698
But if you still get dumped after changing, 
I'm taking you off our family register.

180
770
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,259
Mom.

181
774
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,965
Do you need lawyers?
Do you have money?

182
779
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,500
No, I will do it myself.

183
783
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,600
After going to the court, I will go on the blind date. 
Don't worry.

184
788
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:12,323
You have a blind date today?

185
792
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:13,218
yes.

186
796
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,900
You came home at dawn, didn't you?
 Where were you?!

187
801
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,800
You are dead today.

188
805
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:35,758
<i>I had a good time yesterday.
Your service is not too bad.</i>

189
810
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:40,365
But of course. 101:101 wins.

190
814
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,440
<i>$100</i>

191
818
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:25,646
Hey young man, how could you dump it like that?

192
822
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:27,286
You should put it in a trash bags before dumping it,

193
826
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,997
or take it to the recycling center. Take it.

194
830
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:42,999
What?! Sam Soon resigned?

195
834
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:43,949
Yes.

196
838
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:44,815
Why?!

197
842
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:49,680
It's all because of Hee Jin. It would be too awkward to see each other since they've broken up.

198
846
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,909
That no good brat, even after all that I have said...

199
850
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:58,011
But, yesterday Sam Soon's mother
made a scene at the restaurant.

200
855
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:00,981
A scene? Sam Soon's mother?

201
859
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:01,992
Yes.

202
863
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:03,522
Did that punk do something wrong?

203
867
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,453
Maybe...

204
871
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:05,054
What maybe?

205
875
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:06,955
Do you think he got her pregnant?

206
879
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,300
Oh my god!

207
883
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:18,415
Little kid, do you want this?

208
887
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,200
I am not a little kid.

209
891
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,000
Student, why don't you take this?

210
895
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:26,848
Why?

211
899
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:33,155
Why? Just because you are cute.

212
903
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:34,656
I don't like it.

213
907
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:35,327
What don't you like?

214
911
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,100
I don't like plush toys.

215
915
00:22:39,144 --> 00:22:42,141
Then why aren't you in school!  
You'll be in trouble if you skip school!

216
920
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:45,934
I am on my way to an academy now, such a strange man.

217
924
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:50,333
You little brat, you will grow up to be like Sam Soon.

218
928
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:14,823
<i>Sam Shik!</i>

219
932
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:21,250
<i>Sam Shik!</i>

220
936
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,517
<i>Where have you been?</i>

221
940
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:33,778
<i>Look at your blackened hands. 
If a crow sees them, he would say, "Grandpa!"</i>

222
945
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:38,775
<i>Hurry, go wash those hands and come eat and study now.</i>

223
949
00:24:12,358 --> 00:24:14,400
Kim Sam Soon, take this back.

224
953
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,300
And by the way, when are you picking up the bicycle?

225
957
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,300
Didn't Sam Soon resign?

226
961
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,450
I'm sorry.

227
965
00:24:31,874 --> 00:24:33,646
Can you manage alone?

228
969
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:36,015
I am worried too.

229
973
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:39,458
Just bear with it for a few days. It will be resolved soon.

Applicant's birth name... Kim Sam Soon,
changed to Kim Hee Jin.

The Han word is Kim Hee....

263
1118
00:27:34,408 --> 00:27:44,924
and this is err...Yoo Hee Jin, Kim Hee Jin.
Why out of all names must it be Hee Jin?

Oh really, what to do?

265

Have you heard of the tragic tale about Sam Soon?

268
1139
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:20,335
An undergraduate girl named Sam Soon
went for a class excursion.

269
1144
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:25,672
After some drinks, the guys
start to tease her about her name.

270
1149
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:31,129
The hurt female undergraduate ran
out in tears and got on a taxi.

271
1154
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:35,204
Student, with a face of good fortune
like you, what are you crying about?

272
1159
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,800
Why? Is your boyfriend giving you a hard time?

273
1163
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,967
No.

274
1167
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,601
Why are you crying?
You are at the best time of your youth.

275
1172
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:52,052
My friends always tease me about my name, that it sounds like a country bumpkin.

276
1176
00:28:52,052 --> 00:28:55,444
You are crying over that? It's nothing.

277
1180
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,800
Why don't you try.

278
1184
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,100
What is wrong with your name?
As long as it is not Sam Soon, it's ok.

279
1189
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:23,850
Gosh now! This student is really... is it that bad?

280
1193
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:04,400
In the end, Sam Soon jumped out
of the taxi and killed herself.

281
1198
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:22,301
Wait sir! I just need to make
some changes! Give me the pen please.

282
1203
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:01,604
How about this?

283
1207
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,500
So beautiful, I knew you will like this. Later on you can play some real doctor games with Unnie.

284
1211
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,800
Kitchen toys, you want this too?

285
1215
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,566
You want to read this?
She learned Korean?

286
1220
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:42,252
She picked it up early. She knows almost everything.

287
1224
00:31:42,252 --> 00:31:44,708
But it looks a little difficult.

288
1228
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:48,965
I know, I'll buy it.

289
1232
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:51,100
If it is too difficult, you can read it later.

290
1236
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,400
Let's go.

291
1240
00:32:18,578 --> 00:32:21,148
How long has she been attending this place?

292
1244
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,487
About 2 years.

293
1248
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:24,462
You take her here all this time?

294
1252
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,900
Almost.

295
1256
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,371
It must be tiring, twice a week. It's not easy.

296
1260
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:34,607
But you are here now, Sam Soon.

297
1264
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,600
We can take turns every week.

298
1268
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,200
What?

299
1272
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,800
Oh....Nothing.

300
1276
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,800
Did you manage to speak to Kim Sam Soon?

301
1280
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,900
Huh?

302
1284
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:09,518
Didn't you say there was important stuff?

303
1288
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:10,982
Yeah.

304
1292
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,600
What is it?

305
1296
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,699
Just restaurant stuff.

306
1300
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,600
What about the restaurant?

307
1304
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,000
She resigned.

308
1308
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,900
Why?

309
1312
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,800
Something happened.

310
1316
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,500
Is it possibly because of me?

311
1320
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,700
Why do you think it's because of you?

312
1324
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Even if it was just a contract relationship,

313
1328
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,700
I'm just wondering if she feels uncomfortable because of me.

314
1332
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,800
Did something happen between you two?

315
1336
00:33:46,304 --> 00:33:48,517
No, don't think too much about it.

316
1340
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,900
Does Kim Sam Soon like you?

317
1344
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,100
It didn't feel as though she was faking it on Jeju Island.

318
1348
00:34:04,114 --> 00:34:07,170
I am not too sure.

319
1352
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,300
What do you want to know?

320
1356
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:18,020
Nothing, forget it.

321
1360
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:41,795
How much is your monthly pay?

322
1364
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:43,674
What is your annual income then?

323
1368
00:34:43,674 --> 00:34:45,720
I make quite a bit.

324
1372
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,751
I make quite a bit, too.

325
1376
00:34:48,457 --> 00:34:50,908
I heard your mother is single.

326
1380
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:53,390
If you get married, must you care for your mother too?

327
1384
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,247
Not just care for her, but live with her.

328
1388
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:57,157
Aren't you the youngest of three?

329
1392
00:34:57,157 --> 00:34:58,439
Don't you have elder sisters?

330
1396
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:01,742
Compared to my sisters, 
she gets along with me better.

331
1401
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,600
I heard you were the glamorous type, 
but you look chubbier than I had expected.

332
1406
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,900
I also heard that you were handsome.

333
1410
00:35:17,578 --> 00:35:21,765
That hairstyle of yours is like  ... it's f***ing ugly.

334
1414
00:35:21,765 --> 00:35:25,121
How old are you? How could you utter something so rude?

335
1418
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:27,780
Oh my, excuse me.

336
1422
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,100
I am sorry that these lips have batons on them.

337
1426
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,600
Really. She broke up for only a few days...

338
1430
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,500
What do you mean?

339
1434
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,600
She broke up with Jin Hyun oppa. 
His ex-girlfriend, Hee Jin, came back.

340
1439
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,600
Let's go.

341
1443
00:36:40,296 --> 00:36:42,368
May I help you?

342
1447
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Did you change your pastry chef?

343
1451
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:48,170
Yes, something came up...

344
1455
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:53,409
No wonder. This is not the same as before.
We came here because of the cakes.

345
1460
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:56,695
I am so sorry. Is there anything else you need?

346
1464
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,200
Forget it.

347
1468
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:19,246
Is table 15's mousse ready?

348
1472
00:37:19,246 --> 00:37:20,703
Right away.

349
1476
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:32,464
Hot!

350
1480
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,800
Are you ok? In Hye.

351
1484
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:40,817
You are not young anymore.

352
1488
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:43,846
Isn't this out of line when you are on a matchmaking date?

353
1492
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:46,434
I am so sorry again,

354
1496
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:49,463
but I threw my manners into my
soup and drank it all up a long time ago.

355
1501
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,600
Are you messing around with me?

356
1505
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,500
You're so sensible ...

357
1509
00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:56,722
This woman is really...

358
1513
00:37:56,722 --> 00:37:59,833
You are not young either,
and you still see me as a girl.

359
1518
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,300
Oh dear, I really don't know what to do.

360
1522
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,800
Just my bad luck.

361
1526
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:11,129
I have worse luck than you!

362
1530
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,500
Do you think you are Jo In Sung?
Parting your hair like that!

363
1535
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,200
Kim Hee Jin?

364
1539
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,400
You are still tough.

365
1543
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:28,768
Oh my, what are you doing here?

366
1547
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:31,394
I was on a match date too,
but I've been rejected.

367
1552
00:38:32,453 --> 00:38:34,461
Oh I see...

368
1556
00:38:34,461 --> 00:38:36,483
May I sit down?

369
1560
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,100
Of course, that is what a chair is for.

370
1564
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,529
Oppa! It's Che Ri.

371
1568
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:25,209
Long time no see, what's up?

372
1572
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,939
I saw something interesting.

373
1576
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,700
Your ex-girlfriend Sam Soon. I was here for my workout, but I saw her here on a match make date!

374
1580
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,900
You two broke up for only a few days, and she is out match making!

375
1584
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:47,600
Hello? Oppa? What is this?

376
1588
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,700
It didn't work out with that previous guy?

377
1592
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,100
Actually...

378
1596
00:40:14,948 --> 00:40:20,732
He's a bad boss.  He looks young yet he treats his subordinates like that.

379
1600
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:24,842
Precisely, that is I want to
resign as soon as possible.

380
1605
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:29,114
That is the right thinking. With your abilities,
you can definitely find something better.

381
1610
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:33,885
How could you when you haven't tasted my...

382
1614
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,800
Isn't this the benefit of age? You see things very quickly.

383
1618
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,800
Oh yes, just like a gift from time.

384
1622
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:58,700
Your hair looks very good. Did Geum Soon do this for you?

385
1626
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:09,497
Actually the assistant head stylist
wanted to do my hair,

386
1631
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,800
but I kept insisting on Geum Soon for me.

387
1635
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:19,524
Yes, what I didn't complete the last time, I will go all the way now.

388
1639
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:23,694
Now that I applied for a new name.
Kim Hee Jin, fighting.

389
1644
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,200
Sam Soon.

390
1648
00:41:30,857 --> 00:41:32,056
Noona, why do you keep doing this?

391
1652
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,644
Didn't you say you won't  go on match make dates anymore?

392
1656
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:36,008
Mother  is half way there.

393
1660
00:41:36,966 --> 00:41:45,672
You know, he is acting. This guy is a little... a little crazy.

394
1664
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,100
Just listen to me, just trust me, okay?

395
1668
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,654
Have you been drinking coffee again?

396
1672
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,400
Didn't I tell you not to take that.
It is bad for the baby!

397
1677
00:42:02,671 --> 00:42:04,079
Let's go, Noona.

398
1681
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,820
What are you doing this again?

399
1685
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,620
Let's go!

400
1689
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,763
What are you doing!?

401
1693
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:09,825
Let's go and then talk.

402
1697
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,700
What are you doing, really!?

403
1701
00:42:12,773 --> 00:42:15,907
Hey! Do you really want a bashing from me?

404
1705
00:42:15,907 --> 00:42:17,676
In Hye is hurt.

405
1709
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,603
What?

406
1713
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:23,085
She's burnt, and the bakery has stopped operating.

407
1717
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:44,903
In Hye, where are you hurt? Let me see, where?
Are you okay? Where are you hurt?

408
1722
00:42:44,903 --> 00:42:48,849
Just because I told you to treat your body like a thermometer, 
how could you burn yourself like this.

409
1727
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:51,409
Where is it? Do you need to go to the hospital?

410
1731
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:52,873
What is it?

411
1735
00:42:53,878 --> 00:42:59,037
Where? Arms? Where on the arms?

412
1739
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,800
Here.

413
1743
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,600
I applied some ointments, and I'm fine.
Why did you come over?

414
1748
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,700
What kind of a joke is this!?

415
1752
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,700
Do you like men that much?

416
1756
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,200
You did your hair and bought clothes
just for the match make date.

417
1761
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:41,790
Did you forget the conditions of our contract?
You cannot see other men besides me.

418
1766
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,908
Isn't the contract cancelled?

419
1770
00:43:42,908 --> 00:43:46,156
There is still 50 million outstanding, right? You still have to abide to them before you return that.

420
1774
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,000
Then why did you take the house deed?

421
1778
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,100
I was afraid I would be beaten
to death by your mother.

422
1783
00:43:54,403 --> 00:43:57,448
Before returning the $50,000,
just stick to the conditions...

423
1788
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:16,208
Are you fooling around here?

424
1792
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,256
You are the one who is fooling around.

425
1796
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:19,520
Showing off your money.

426
1800
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,069
By the way,

427
1804
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:25,371
I secretly borrowed this outfit from
my sister. I don't waste my money.

428
1809
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:31,176
Go buy some clothes!

429
1813
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,300
Kim Sam Soon, let's talk.

430
1817
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,170
♫<i> I'm sorry.</i> ♫

431
1821
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,600
It's enough.
♫<i> It's not me.</i>♫

432
1826
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,051
Let go.

433
1830
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:03,240
♫<i> I can't  love you any more. /i>♫</i>

434
1834
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:10,810
♫<i> I'm crying as you push me away. </i>♫

435
1838
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:17,700
♫<i> You're looking at me who am breathless.</i>♫

436
1842
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:27,470
♫<i>I love you even if you are leaving me. </i>♫

437
1846
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:34,030
♫<i> But for me you aren't there.</i>♫

438
1850
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:40,880
♫<i>Don't look for me. I've lost </i>♫

439
1854
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:49,310
♫<i>The love which only looked at you. <i>♫</i></i>

440
1858
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,510
♫<i> It is you. <i>♫</i></i>

441
1862
00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:01,800
♫<i>You loved me. <i>♫</i></i>

442
1866
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,600
♫<i> It cannot be that you don't remember me.</i> ♫

443
1870
00:46:05,601 --> 00:46:07,161
<i>Now, I have you by my side, Sam Soon.</i>

♫<i> In another world </i>♫

445
1878
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,100
Did Kim Sam Soon like you?

446
1882
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:19,630
<i>I am not sure, what are you getting at?</i>

447
1886
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:21,448
<i>Do you love Jin Hyun?</i>

448
1890
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:25,309
<i>President ... no, I really love Jin Hyun.</i>

449
1894
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:26,549
<i>So please don't interfere.</i>

450
1898
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:31,971
<i>Don't you feel that you are brazen? </i>

451
1902
00:46:33,152 --> 00:46:37,763
<i>There was no news for 3 years, and then you come back out of the blue and want me to back off.</i>

452
1906
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,200
<i>What logic is that?</i>

453
1910
00:46:41,605 --> 00:46:45,903
<i>Memories are just memories;
 they have no power.<i></i></i>

454
1915
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:58,760
Are you ready?

455
1919
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,390
Yeah, I am.

456
1923
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,800
Thank you. Thank you.

457
1927
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,870
You really want to eat this?

458
1931
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,430
This is one of my favorite dishes/
 You like spicy food, don't you?

459
1936
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,400
Why don't you try it?

460
1940
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,940
Oh, wait.

461
1944
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,930
What?

462
1948
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,120
Let me try it first.

463
1952
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,730
Okay.

464
1956
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,420
Nice?

465
1960
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,600
Much too hot.

466
1964
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,220
Kim chee, bulgogi, okay.

467
1968
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,450
This is too hot.  Don't eat it.

468
1972
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,500
I've been craving for this ddeokbokki for the whole week.

469
1976
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,760
If you eat that, it's going to hurt your stomach.

470
1980
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,400
It's okay. I'm Korean.

471
1984
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,610
Korean?

472
1988
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:18,090
Thank you.

473
1992
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,220
It's moving.

474
1996
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:27,270
Of course, it's moving.
 It's not moving, it wouldn't be alive.

475
2001
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,900
You've got to eat it alive.

476
2005
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:38,180
Try this.  This is one of the well-being foods in Korea.

477
2009
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,410
No thanks. No thanks.

478
2013
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:45,440
Uh uh.  Dr. Kim you have to test this to see if I should eat it or not.

479
2017
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,140
That one. Here.

480
2021
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,400
My tongue.  It bites my tongue.

481
2025
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:11,780
It bites my tongue.

482
2029
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,210
Chew it or swallow it or something.

483
2033
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,380
It's nice.  It's yummy.

484
2037
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,500
Ummm. Yummy.

485
2041
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,100
I'm going to taste all the nicest food in the world

486
2045
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,340
and live a long healthy life.

487
2049
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:44,070
Something's wrong with you tonight.

488
2053
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,080
Why? What makes you say that?

489
2057
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,850
'Cause you always laugh when there's something wrong.

490
2061
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:57,560
Why is it that you seem to know me more than I do?

491
2065
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,400
What's up?

492
2069
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,600
--Nothing.
--Nothing?

493
2074
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,880
You know. Just something stupid. Boring.

494
2078
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,760
It's like this.

495
2082
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,830
Things shine at first,

496
2086
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:20,470
and then, as time goes by,  they tend to fade away,

497
2090
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:25,740
and eventually, it's just not there any more.

498
2094
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,560
The shine.

499
2098
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,860
It's stupid.  I don't know why, 
 but it just came across my head.

500
2103
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,810
--Shine?
Mmhmm.

501
2108
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,980
Because ...

502
2112
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:42,050
I think I use to shine, but, you know,

503
2116
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:46,190
after the operation and the medication

504
2120
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,840
I think it's all gone now.

505
2124
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:54,120
You still shine.

506
2128
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:01,800
Yeah but, that's not what I meant.

507
2132
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,360
It's stupid anyways.
 Let's eat.

508
2137
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,430
Eat it.

509
2141
00:51:51,326 --> 00:51:53,711
Chang Soo, cigarettes and light.

510
2145
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,387
Noona, didn't you quit smoking?

511
2149
00:51:55,387 --> 00:51:56,569
I feel like having one.

512
2153
00:51:56,569 --> 00:51:58,355
Then take mine.

513
2157
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,700
Thanks.

514
2161
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,400
Chang Soo, get me another stick!

515
2165
00:52:37,144 --> 00:52:39,987
There are more than 4,000 chemicals in a cigarette.

516
2169
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:47,042
Tar, carbon monoxide, nicotine, arsenic, ammonia, cadmium, potassium cyanide, formaldehyde, methanol ...

517
2173
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:49,930
Hey. Are you making some public service commercial?

518
2177
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Don't smoke. I don't like people who smoke.

519
2181
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:00,200
Harassment, harrassment, you cigarette of a man.

520
2185
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,200
Do you know why I needed 50 million?

521
2189
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:39,000
This house, my father used his
life to earn this house.

522
2194
00:53:39,782 --> 00:53:48,212
To keep this house. But you made
use of that to make fun of me.

523
2199
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,500
And that guy just now, do you
know what that meant to me?

524
2204
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:04,500
To have two matchmaking dates with
the same guy - that is not simple fate.

525
2209
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:10,978
The other day and today too we were getting
along so fine. What are you trying to do?

526
2214
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:18,700
Can I still meet someone who likes me
and treats me well? It's all been ruined by you.

527
2219
00:54:20,617 --> 00:54:27,871
You chased away what possibly
could be the last man in my life!

528
2224
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,900
Why do you keep thinking it is the last one?

529
2228
00:54:32,248 --> 00:54:33,874
Are you still making fun of me?

530
2232
00:54:33,874 --> 00:54:37,091
You can meet so many much better men.

531
2236
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:41,557
How many? How many?!

532
2240
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,800
Sam Soon, you have charm.

533
2244
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,700
You don't know how attractive you are,
and that is your attraction.

534
2249
00:55:03,665 --> 00:55:09,172
Didn't I tell you not to talk nonsense?

535
2253
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,100
It's not nonsense!

536
2257
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,200
I will not believe you.

537
2261
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,900
On Jeju Island, you were the one who
mislead me and then left me alone.

538
2266
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,100
Why are you staring at me like that?

539
2270
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,400
Don't see other men, and
stop going on blind dates.
