00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,705
<i>My Name is Kim Sam Soon</i>

2
7
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:10,405
<i>Episode 12: So What? I'm Only 30!</i>

3
11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,320
What are you going to do about Yoo Hee Jin?

4
15
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,806
What's with your expression?

5
19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,900
I asked, what are you going to do about Yoo Hee Jin?

6
23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,600
I'm still thinking about it.

7
27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,500
Then, without even thinking, you 
carried out this kind of mess?

8
32
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,010
It's just... I'm not sure what's what either.

9
36
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,398
If you don't know, who does?
Does piggy Sam Sook know then?

10
41
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:20,655
Is this really a time to joke?

11
45
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm just so frustrated with everything. Why?

12
49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,800
It's because I'm just so uptight about everything. Why?

13
53
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Wow... really...

14
57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,500
What?! You said you changed your name?

15
61
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,946
To Kim Hee Jin.

16
65
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:51,981
On whose account?!

17
69
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
On my account! I even got my mom's permission.

18
73
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:56,973
Is that something that can be 
settled just by applying like that?

19
78
00:01:56,973 --> 00:01:58,144
Not exactly.

20
82
00:01:58,144 --> 00:02:02,410
Processing will take about one month, and... 
Well, there is a possibility it can get rejected.

21
87
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,756
Cancel it immediately.

22
91
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:05,941
Cancel it right away.

23
95
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:07,721
I like the name Sam Soon!

24
99
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:08,321
What are you to tell me?

25
103
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:11,175
Hey, did you not listen to anything up to this point?!

26
107
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,800
Until you sort your little cheating issue, don't even THINK about getting in my way.

27
111
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:24,214
Cancel it immediately! If not, I'm going to go cancel it!

28
115
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,700
Change your name to Sam Shik! Then I'll call it off.

29
119
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,018
The person I like is not Kim Hee Jin but Kim Sam Soon!

30
123
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,733
Just because the name changes, does that mean the person changes as well?

31
127
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:35,239
So then why are you changing it? 
Just keep living as Kim Sam Soon!

32
132
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,279
I don't want to!

33
136
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,200
Name change has been my very first goal in my life.

34
140
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:43,884
Also, until you sort things out with 
the other girl, don't meddle in my business.

35
145
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:50,143
Why are you making it so complicated?

36
149
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:52,143
Why are you making things so hard?! Why!

37
153
00:02:57,951 --> 00:03:00,812
If there's anyone in this world who is as 
simple as me, tell them to try and come out!

38
158
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:03,812
The one who's complicated is YOU.

39
162
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,600
Hey, President Hyun!

40
166
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:14,578
Why don't we have a chat.

41
170
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:18,005
Don't meet with Sam Soon.

42
174
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,345
Don't meet with her, okay?

43
178
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:20,957
But I want to meet her.

44
182
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:21,640
What?

45
186
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,581
What is the reason? Why is it I can't meet with her?

46
190
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:25,115
Are you asking because you don't know?

47
194
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:26,050
Yes, I really don't know.

48
198
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,300
I know VERY MUCH about men such as yourself.

49
202
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,322
You think Sam Soon appears very special to you, don't you?

50
206
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,120
Yes.

51
210
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,370
Of course you probably do!

52
214
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,070
Because in YOUR world, you will never find a girl like her.

53
218
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,636
I'm not being insulting.
I'm just explaining that there's a difference.

54
223
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,277
What I want to say is,

55
227
00:03:41,277 --> 00:03:44,139
don't take an interest in her just because she's different.

56
231
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,239
That sort of desire...
won't even last six months.

57
236
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:48,083
Sister-in-law...

58
240
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,083
Who are you to call me Sister-in-law!

59
244
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,980
Anyway, Sister-in-law,

60
248
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,403
even  between  Sam Soon and me,
 the situation is complicated enough as it is.

61
253
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,415
So it'd be nice if you didn't interfere 
and make things even more complicated.

62
258
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:02,293
Look, for a person like you, HEE JIN is the perfect match.

63
262
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:04,640
Though the only interaction I had with 
Hee Jin was inside  a plane,

64
267
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,575
I've already gotten a good sense of what she is like as a person.

65
271
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:08,332
I heard she was very sick.

66
275
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,580
Strong girls like that are rare.

67
279
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,947
For people like you, Hee Jin is a perfect match, I say!

68
283
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:14,634
So! Give up with whatever you're doing at this point.

69
287
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,216
I can't stand to see my sister get hurt again.

70
291
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,700
Do you understand what I'm saying?

71
295
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,000
If you didn't understand, I'll just say one more thing.

72
299
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:29,771
You know... I find you to be rather unfortunate.

73
303
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:33,321
Exactly 50-million-won-worth of bad luck!

74
307
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:14,445
Hey, you hopeless bitch!

75
311
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:17,523
You're probably the only girl that receives 
a confession from a man and stupidly rejects it.

76
316
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:19,734
But it pisses me off.

77
320
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:22,636
The thing I hate the most is cheating, you know.

78
324
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:24,805
Aigoo, you dummy!

79
328
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:27,258
You think it's that easy to move someone's heart?

80
332
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:29,448
Would you like to be a hypocritical someone, like what Hyun Woo is?

81
336
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:31,512
Would you like that? Huh?!

82
340
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:35,791
This is the opportune moment. 
It's time for you to grab at him!

83
345
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,348
Then what about Yoo Hee Jin?

84
349
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:41,284
Aigoo, you butthead.  Are you really in
a position to worry about others?

85
354
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:43,631
Stealing someone's heart isn't a crime.

86
358
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,200
NOT stealing it is being stupid!

87
362
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
How do I seduce him?

88
366
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
<i>Just a second, my shoe...</i>

89
370
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,503
<i>See? I told you to lose some weight!</i>

90
374
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,590
<i>I thought you said you LIKED my belly fat! </i>

91
378
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,000
<i>You're the one who said my belly was a heat-control. Bla, bla, whatever you said!</i>

92
382
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,629
<i>Erg, whatever, get off! Get out of the way...!</i>

93
386
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:20,629
No, no, no, no, no! This is not it. This is not it...

94
390
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,700
Ah, of course! I forgot about Henry!

95
394
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:31,975
<i>Sophie?</i>

96
398
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:33,266
<i>Sophie?</i>

97
402
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,814
<i>Sophie, Sophie... what?</i>

98
406
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:37,215
<i>If you're going to say, 'So Pee, So Pee', just go 
to the bathroom! Why do you keep calling my name...</i>

99
411
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,715
<i>Stop it. This is ridiculous, okay?</i>

100
415
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,700
<i>You! Just sit still and watch, alright?. 
I'm doing this all for you.</i>

101
420
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,300
<i>Don't play around with me.</i>

102
424
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,700
<i>Don't play around with me.</i>

103
428
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,500
<i>Rascal... Wonder where he picked up that line from...</i>

104
432
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,600
<i>"Heliya" 
[Using Korean pronunciation rules on "Henry-ya"]</i>

105
437
00:07:59,498 --> 00:08:02,206
<i>You love Hee Jin, right?</i>

106
441
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:04,505
<i>If you love Hee Jin, you'd be living with her right now, man.</i>

107
445
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:08,128
<i>Why you wasting your money staying here?</i>

108
449
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:10,089
<i>Is your family rich? Hmm?</i>

109
453
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,823
<i>You got some big money making business going on?</i>

110
457
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,114
<i>Oh.. how frustrating!</i>

111
461
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,490
<i>You love Hee Jin!</i>

112
465
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,450
<i>You!  Hee Jin love!  Love!</i>

113
469
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,060
<i>Okay or not okay?</i>

114
473
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:28,589
<i>Ah... You good looking hunk, you... 
why do you have to be all smiley and sh**?</i>

115
478
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:32,233
<i>You're setting a fire in the heart of an old woman.</i>

116
482
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:36,574
<i>Aghh, seriously... This guy's driving me crazy!</i>

117
486
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:41,293
<i>Should I just hand over Sam Shik to 
someone else and fall for you instead?</i>

118
491
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,330
<i>Heli-ya.</i>

119
495
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,210
<i>This isn't the time for you to be like this, hmm?</i>

120
499
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,300
<i>Simply looking in that person's 
direction is not love, I tell you. Platonic!</i>

121
504
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,080
<i>Oh, no!</i>

122
508
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,330
<i>I am not Platonic!
 No! Ne-bor!</i>

123
513
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:06,477
<i>Oh boy... All he does is keep grinning...</i>

124
517
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,900
<i>You may not understand yet because you're still young, but...</i>

125
521
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,995
<i>You think it's that easy to find that 
perfect someone to fall in love with?</i>

126
526
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:13,696
<i>Sophie.</i>

127
530
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:14,797
<i>What?</i>

128
534
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:16,898
<i>I'm not the man that Hee JIn loves.</i>

129
538
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:22,900
<i>So I'm satisfied as long as she's happy and healthy. It doesn't matter who she's with.</i>

130
542
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:24,348
<i>What did you say?</i>

131
546
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:27,442
<i>Whatever you're saying, I need to understand!</i>

132
550
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,092
<i>You and Hee Jin are what? Blah, blah eh?!</i>

133
554
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:30,191
<i>Talk so I can understand you!</i>

134
558
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:33,201
<i>What, what? What are you trying to say?</i>

135
562
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,393
<i>Just hurry up and pack.</i>

136
566
00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:39,096
Ah, no, no. We can't communicate with each other!

137
570
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,200
Surprised right?

138
574
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:52,375
Wow! I must have really surprised you!

139
578
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,233
What's going on?

140
582
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,884
What do you mean 'what'.
Am I not welcome here?

141
587
00:09:57,884 --> 00:10:00,363
I cleaned, and I did the laundry.

142
591
00:10:00,363 --> 00:10:02,248
Come here.

143
595
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm almost done!

144
599
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:08,300
For manners, I made another portion of kimchi.

145
603
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,200
Try it.

146
607
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,900
How is it? Good?

147
611
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:17,656
It's not spicy right?

148
615
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:20,648
It's okay. It tastes good.

149
619
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:22,400
I knew it!

150
623
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,596
How can I be so good my first time?

151
627
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,100
I must have been born with it.

152
631
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:32,328
Do you want to listen to music?

153
635
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,600
What should I put on?

154
639
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,993
Anything.

155
643
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:42,347
From now on, don't do this.

156
647
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,500
There is someone who cleans and does the laundry.

157
651
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,100
This is just practice for the future, so?

158
655
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,900
Jin Hun...

159
659
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Yeah?

160
663
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:55,892
Do you remember the day we first held hands?

161
667
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,800
Maybe you don't?

162
671
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,600
It was so funny!

163
675
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:06,527
We'd meant to date, but almost all day,

164
679
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,400
we just walked around. And, you got frustrated...

165
683
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:12,914
I wanted to hold hands, but I didn't have the courage...

166
687
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,388
I actually realized, but I wanted to see what you would do.

167
691
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:18,690
So I didn't say anything.

168
695
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,200
Eventually within 12 hours and 40 minutes, you held my hand.

169
699
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,433
I sometimes reminisce about  that time.

170
703
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,700
We were innocent...
Everything was new and exciting.

171
708
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:36,598
Even when we become grandpa and grandma,

172
712
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,400
I hope we could live like that!

173
716
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,500
Hee Jin.

174
720
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,600
Do you have something you need to tell me?

175
724
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,960
Yeah.

176
728
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
If you have something you need to tell me, say it!

00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:24,175
Hello?

190
785
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:28,220
Hello?!

191
789
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,000
It's me, Yoo Hee Jin.

192
793
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,911
I'm sorry for asking you out again.

193
797
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,700
It's okay, since I have nothing to do now.

194
801
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,324
I won't make this too long.

195
805
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,600
Jin Hun, don't make him waver anymore.

196
809
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,700
You should know, that he's wavering still.

197
813
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,400
Just leave him alone. It's too tiresome.

198
817
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:00,500
--Yoo Hee Jin...
--Yes?

199
822
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,954
I never shook him myself, you know?

200
826
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:07,278
And you are not in a position to tell me what to do.

201
830
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,860
I'm sorry...

202
834
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,648
I thought it would be good if I told you directly.

203
838
00:14:13,982 --> 00:14:15,264
And by the way,

204
842
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:18,337
I never covet other peoples' things.

205
846
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:19,400
And I also never thought of stealing them.

206
850
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,300
However,

207
854
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:26,200
if he comes to me, I will accept him.

208
858
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Sister.

209
862
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,009
Why am I your sister?

210
866
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:32,386
I never considered you as my dongsaeng (younger sister).

211
870
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:37,076
I only survived because of Jin Hun.

212
874
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,800
What will I do without him?

213
878
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
Hee Jin, you are young.

214
882
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,677
You have a lot of money. You are pretty.

215
886
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,563
You're as skinny as a stick.

216
890
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,700
Ask anyone here who's better than you!

217
894
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,939
And me...

218
898
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,705
I'm not young. I'm not pretty, and I'm chubby.

219
902
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:01,024
Hee Jin, you have so much.

220
906
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,183
But not me!

221
910
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,700
In any case, Jin Hun may be the last chance I have in my life.

222
914
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,600
But sister, you're healthy.

223
918
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:26,713
Yeah, I'm healthy.

224
922
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:30,230
You can eat what you feel like eating.

225
926
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,600
You know how hard it is not to be able to do that?

226
930
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,200
I wish I could be chubby like you.

227
934
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,100
Unnie, your color is good, you look healthy, you are and energetic.

228
938
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,600
I wish I could be like that.

229
942
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:54,566
Don't make that kind of face.
Someone will think I'm harassing you.

230
947
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,100
And also,

231
951
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,000
Don't think I'll cut you some slack 
 because you were sick.

232
956
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,315
And me,

233
960
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:09,345
I'm not a kind enough person
to yield just because you were sick.

234
965
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,800
Let's play fair and leave the decisions up to Jin Hun.

235
969
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:27,017
Also, you better pay for this. I'm unemployed, and I have no money.

236
973
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:31,520
But I do have a conscience.
I ordered the cheapest item.

237
978
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:45,194
I wasn't joking about what I said before.

238
982
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,900
He really seems like my last chance.

239
986
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:22,757
I don't know how to read notes.

240
990
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:29,788
I can play Chopsticks, but I don't know anything besides that.

241
994
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:32,682
Do you... accept people like me as well?

242
998
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,500
Of course! I have... around 10 adult students?

243
1002
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:41,540
Then... I have a goal in mind.

244
1006
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,087
Actually, do you know this song?

245
1010
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:45,055
Elvis Presley's...

246
1014
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:03,824
You know that one, right?

247
1018
00:18:03,824 --> 00:18:07,979
I really want to learn this song.

248
1022
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,800
How long will it take?

249
1026
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:12,656
--Can't Help Falling in Love?
--Yes

250
1031
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,021
Well that differs from person to person.

251
1035
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:16,182
Everyone knows that.

252
1039
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,200
If you learn that one only and practice hard, it won't take more than a month or so.

253
1043
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:25,207
Then, can I learn it right now?

254
1047
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:27,035
How much is the fee?

255
1051
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,100
Are you playing with your feet?

256
1055
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,700
This time, do it well!

257
1059
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,300
1... 2... 3.

258
1063
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:31,467
<i>With you, my brown eyed girl.</i>

259
1067
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:38,668
<i>You, my
brown eyed girl.</i>

260
1072
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,300
What's on your mind?

261
1076
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,570
I don't know, I get moody these days...

262
1080
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,700
Maybe because of the rain.

263
1084
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,900
Why do you think people get emotional when it rains?

264
1088
00:19:56,673 --> 00:20:00,174
When I was young, I used to think that worms were falling from the sky when it rained.

265
1092
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:01,275
What?

266
1096
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:04,776
Because the next morning, you wake up, and there's worms everywhere.

267
1100
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:08,276
So now, every time it rains, I think of worms.

268
1104
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:11,477
You're so weird.

269
1108
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:12,978
A little bit, yeah.

270
1112
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:17,480
Henry.

271
1116
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Hmm?

272
1120
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:23,482
What would you have done if you were in my shoes?

273
1124
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:25,383
What do you mean?

274
1128
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:26,883
You know, 3 years ago.

275
1132
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:29,784
Would you have left without a word?

276
1136
00:20:32,585 --> 00:20:34,086
No.

277
1140
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:37,487
I would've stayed and fought through it together.

278
1144
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:42,987
I would have fought through no matter what... together.

279
1148
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:47,588
I feel the same now.

280
1152
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:51,789
If I could, I want to turn everything back to the way it was.

281
1156
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,700
Then, I wouldn't make the same mistake again.

282
1160
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,400
I should have just stayed no matter what and 
 solved it with him together.

283
1165
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,793
That's all in the past now.

284
1169
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:08,994
Yeah I see that.

285
1173
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:10,994
That's what makes me mad.

286
1177
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,895
I don't know why I left him in the first place.

287
1181
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:19,396
Did something happen with Mr. Hun?

288
1185
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:24,798
Do you want me to beat him up for you?

289
1189
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:26,299
I can do it! Seriously!

290
1193
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,200
How?

291
1197
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,900
You didn't go home? 
What are you doing alone.

292
1202
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,100
What are you looking at?
 Just drowning my emotions.

293
1207
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,500
Have a drink with me.

294
1211
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:07,149
Oh my,  it's been a long time since we had a drink.

295
1215
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:08,933
Hey, what are you going to do about the restaurant's patissier?

296
1219
00:22:09,348 --> 00:22:11,241
I really, really think I'm gonna die.

297
1223
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,000
Starting tomorrow, a patissiere from the hotel will be coming.

298
1227
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,477
Part-time? You aren't going to search for a new one?

299
1231
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,800
For now.

300
1235
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,900
I'd meant to keep out of my boss's personal life, but....

301
1239
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:32,555
Whats going on between you and Sam Soon?

302
1243
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:41,602
Well... As a woman, Sam Soon is a bit... different.

303
1247
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:52,807
A girl who just fits in your arms is perfect,
but Samsoon is just so...wide that

304
1252
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,300
Chef.

305
1256
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,900
Sam soon...does fit right in my arms.

306
1260
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,700
That's fortunate.

307
1264
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,000
If she fits, she fits.
What's up with those slanty eyes?

308
1269
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,200
Don't try to fight my
charisma? I have charisma in the kitchen too!

309
1274
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,100
Drink...

310
1278
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:30,675
It's not a gid deal, but .... Sam Soon has an older sister you know.

311
1282
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,356
Do you...know anything about her?

312
1286
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:35,630
What?

313
1290
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,870
Sam Soon's Sister...

314
1294
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,497
She came last time, remember?
Kim LeeYeong or something like that.

315
1299
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:45,005
I really don't know.

316
1303
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:47,144
That's okay.

317
1307
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:49,145
But... What about Sam Soon's sister?

318
1311
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,930
No, it's just, well ...

319
1315
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:56,987
But why are all the women from that family so violent? Totally like gangsters..

320
1319
00:23:56,987 --> 00:23:58,823
I'm so scared sometimes.

321
1323
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:01,000
With the three put together, the image would be...

322
1327
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:07,596
<i>Don't meet Sam Soon.</i>

323
1331
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:08,954
<i>Don't meet her!</i>

324
1335
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,300
<i>I, I'm so disgusted.</i>

325
1339
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,100
<i>I'm 50,000 dollars worth disgusted.</i>

326
1343
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:19,146
<i>Hee jin is totally right for you.</i>

327
1347
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:22,844
<i>Hee Jin, I first met her on the plane, but</i>

328
1351
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,500
<i>you get a feel for who people are.</i>

329
1355
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,569
<i>She was really sick.</i>

330
1359
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:28,542
<i>Such strong girls are rare.</i>

331
1363
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,185
<i>So stay away from this house.</i>

332
1367
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,000
<i>I don't want to see my sister scarred again, got it?</i>

333
1371
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:47,869
Are we there? Let's get out. Let's get off.

334
1375
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Oh, that's enough for tonight.

335
1379
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:52,286
What do you mean, 'That's enough'?

336
1383
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:59,691
Jin Hun, don't screw around.
Eesh, this little thing is...You're still wet behind the ears.

337
1388
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,490
Hey, sit up quickly.

338
1392
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:13,432
Hey Mr.. Pull over! Hurry, hurry...

339
1396
00:25:27,877 --> 00:25:29,661
Please confirm it.

340
1400
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,955
Just as you've said,
we've attached 50,000 dollars separately.

341
1405
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:40,273
Here...

342
1409
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:41,955
Go right now and finish it.

343
1413
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:44,476
Finish it totally with Sam Shik.

344
1417
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:52,180
What's up with your expression?

345
1421
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,024
Don't you want to pay him back?

346
1425
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:54,769
Sister...

347
1429
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,500
What!

348
1433
00:26:00,177 --> 00:26:04,799
Sam Shik likes me.

349
1437
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,100
He grew to like me.

350
1441
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:13,004
Get yourself together!

351
1445
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:16,013
Sam Shik is someone who
buys people for 50,000 dollars!

352
1450
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,400
And you believe him?

353
1454
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:21,037
I want to believe him.

354
1458
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,000
He played with your heart many times.
Do you still want to believe him?

355
1463
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,400
I still....want to believe him.

356
1467
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:32,407
In the future, don't curse Sam Shik

357
1471
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,700
If you curse him, whether it's mom or sister, I'm not letting you off.

358
1475
00:26:36,786 --> 00:26:38,137
Stop it.

359
1479
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,400
Did he finish things with Yoo Hee Jin?

360
1483
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:44,662
See! He hasn't  has he?

361
1487
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,828
He's that kind of guy.

362
1491
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:51,112
Go and pay him back now, 
you hopeless girl!

363
1496
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,000
Hey!  Hey!

364
1500
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,800
It's the money I owe you... Check it.

365
1504
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:23,885
Oh...today my sister sold her apartment.

366
1508
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,470
Give me the deed to the house please.

367
1512
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:50,894
Hey... HEY! Are you crazy?

368
1516
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,383
You crazy guy! What kind of person are you?

369
1520
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:56,820
It's my money.

370
1524
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,416
What?

371
1528
00:27:57,416 --> 00:28:02,300
You paid the money back. I received the money. Then I tore it up.

372
1532
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:10,109
I am someone who likes money a lot. But now I like you more than $50,000.

373
1536
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:12,253
Do you believe me now?

374
1540
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,400
Cancel your name change.

375
1544
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:23,530
You....really can't be helped, can you?

376
1548
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:27,896
Is that money a joke to you? 
Is $50,000 a joke?

377
1553
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:30,173
Whether my house is foreclosed,
is that a joke to you?!

378
1558
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:31,762
It's my choice.

379
1562
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,200
It would be better if you just sold the restaurant.

380
1566
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,535
Sell it, and just burn the money.

381
1570
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:45,848
I can do it.  I like you that much.

382
1574
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:49,646
Buying hearts with money...
is that liking someone?

383
1579
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:50,924
It's not like that!

384
1583
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:53,885
Don't make it complicated, just accept it

385
1587
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:05,172
I knew from the start, but...

386
1591
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,700
I didn't think you'd be this horrible.

387
1595
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,300
Ignorant of the struggles of this world.

388
1599
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:19,200
I'm sorry to my heart,
and I am feel so ashamed.

389
1604
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:23,333
Men like you...

390
1608
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,700
I don't want to show you to my father.

391
1612
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,398
We meet again..

392
1616
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,600
Yes...

393
1620
00:29:49,794 --> 00:29:51,162
I had some business.

394
1624
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,100
Me as well.
We made plans to see a movie.

395
1629
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,300
Unnie ...

396
1633
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,200
It's a new employee?

397
1637
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,700
No...We're borrowing him from the hotel...

398
1641
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,400
Oh, is that so?

399
1645
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,800
That notebook I gave you last time,
could I get it back?

400
1650
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:33,388
C-could I give it to you later?
I'm still looking at it.....

401
1655
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:35,373
Give it to me now.

402
1659
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,200
Yes...

403
1663
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:55,821
Learn a lot, okay?

404
1667
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,400
What?

405
1671
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:44,386
Excuse me...

406
1675
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:45,594
Yes?

407
1679
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:49,047
Has the chef changed?

408
1683
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,300
No... why?

409
1687
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,800
Nothing, it's fine.

410
1691
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,100
It doesn't taste as good as before.... what about yours?

411
1695
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,500
Well..

412
1699
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:08,045
Then why are you eating it?

413
1703
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,700
Because..the taste is not bad.

414
1707
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,400
The flavour changed..

415
1711
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,200
The taste changed... let's go.

416
1715
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,918
Let's go somewhere else. The place we used to go.

417
1719
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,803
Did we have that few places to go?

418
1723
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,491
We're already here. Let's eat..

419
1727
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,800
No, I don't want to... I'm not in a good mood. I'm not going to eat. Let's go out, quickly.

420
1731
00:33:36,904 --> 00:33:38,823
Hey... Hee Jin.

421
1735
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,000
Lady... Lady! It's noisy!

422
1739
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,233
Your calling me Lady?

423
1743
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:03,594
I said don't play it like that.

424
1747
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,500
Do you know Art?

425
1751
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,893
You're Kim Sam Soon, right?

426
1755
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:17,100
Yes, that's right.

427
1759
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,000
This registered mail came for you,.

428
1763
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,163
Thank you.

429
1767
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,300
Confirming your name has been changed
 from Kim Sam Soon to Kim Hee Jin.

430
1772
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:43,598
I'm Kim Hee Jin!

431
1776
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:44,790
Mom!

432
1780
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,000
Mom, try calling me, Hee Jin!

433
1784
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,100
Sister, you hear that? I'm Hee Jin!

434
1788
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,400
Oh... yeah, what am I supposed to do?

435
1792
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,800
I have so much to do...Identification, credit card must be changed to Kim Hee Jin.

436
1796
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:03,700
I have to update my bank card, passport...

437
1800
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,400
This isn't just ordinary work, this...

438
1804
00:35:07,698 --> 00:35:12,515
So what? I'm Kim Hee Jin!

439
1808
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,900
So what...!

440
1812
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,400
You're that happy?

441
1816
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,400
Yeah...that happy?

442
1820
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:24,291
But your...mood swings are a bit severe.

443
1824
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,400
I really like it!

444
1828
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:35,236
So...I'm...Kim Hee jin now...

445
1832
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:39,995
I'm Kim Hee jin, Kim Hee jin.

446
1836
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,244
Today...you're very sensitive.

447
1840
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,300
It's not the taste from before..

448
1844
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,465
Those people are weird too...

449
1848
00:35:54,465 --> 00:35:56,397
Why does the taste change when the cooks haven't?

450
1852
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,500
I don't like that kind of place.

451
1856
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
Just wait a little longer. We're almost there.

452
1860
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,800
It's not here anymore.

453
1864
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,300
It's gone.

454
1868
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:46,421
So, it is.

455
1872
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,000
Don't you care?

456
1876
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,600
It used to be that  you wouldn't eat Spaghetti if it wasn't here or at the place earlier!

457
1880
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,044
What are you doing about something so little?

458
1884
00:36:55,044 --> 00:36:56,358
Why are you being like this?

459
1888
00:36:56,358 --> 00:36:58,134
Nothing big?

460
1892
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,000
The place you and I used to come together
disappeared. I'm telling you!

461
1897
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:02,298
Hee Jin..

462
1901
00:37:02,298 --> 00:37:04,140
How can you change so much?

463
1905
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,685
It's gone. It's gone.

464
1909
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:09,017
What's up with you?

465
1913
00:37:09,017 --> 00:37:10,349
Henry wouldn't be like this. 
He treasures memories!

466
1918
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:12,554
We had so many memories here.

467
1922
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:44,067
Really? You are really finished?

468
1926
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,209
What suddenly changed your mind?

469
1930
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,400
Don't ask.

470
1934
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,600
If I tell you, I'll just become laughable.

471
1938
00:37:57,161 --> 00:38:00,605
In just a few hours,  you became a human.

472
1942
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:02,730
Why?

473
1946
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,300
Did he change his attitude as soon as you gave him the money? He doesn't see you now?

474
1950
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,920
Stop asking!!

475
1954
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,100
OK, okay!

476
1958
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,000
Sis.

477
1962
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:23,996
Should I consider lipo? (liposuction)

478
1966
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:26,330
Did he tell you to do that?

479
1970
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,041
Give up, give up.

480
1974
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:30,241
How many liters of fat you trying to take off?

481
1978
00:38:31,193 --> 00:38:34,050
Anyway. Don't struggle over men.

482
1982
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,365
In this kind of world,
the only thing left is worries and pain. Understand?

483
1987
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:39,397
Okay?

484
1991
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,100
Cheers!

485
1995
00:38:47,247 --> 00:38:49,026
Should I consider lipo?

486
1999
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,131
Such empty words.

487
2003
00:38:51,131 --> 00:38:53,735
It's always the skinny people.

488
2007
00:38:53,735 --> 00:38:54,562
This little girl...

489
2011
00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:56,422
I am right!

490
2015
00:38:58,289 --> 00:38:59,438
I really ought to just hang them up somewhere, grrr.

491
2019
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,439
Hey...

492
2023
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,441
Nice catch.

493
2027
00:39:14,441 --> 00:39:16,241
So how was your date?

494
2031
00:39:16,842 --> 00:39:18,342
Well...

495
2035
00:39:18,342 --> 00:39:24,343
As you can see, soaking wet. And that's about it.

496
2039
00:39:24,343 --> 00:39:27,644
So why did you come here instead of going home?

497
2043
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:31,245
What?  You getting sick of me now?

498
2047
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,646
You miss me.

499
2051
00:39:33,646 --> 00:39:35,747
You miss me?

500
2055
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,700
You scare me sometimes you know that?

501
2059
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:44,048
I don't know, maybe

502
2063
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,649
I'm getting too used to you now.

503
2067
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:49,020
Really?  Really!?

504
2071
00:39:49,949 --> 00:39:51,750
Ah!  Whatever...

505
2075
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,400
Thank you.

506
2079
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,300
Whats going on?

507
2083
00:39:59,468 --> 00:40:00,802
Did you come here to sleep?

508
2087
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,500
Yes.

509
2091
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:08,430
Momo followed the turtle down a long hall
to two different doors.

510
2096
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:13,430
The turtle stopped in front of  a small door.

511
2100
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,500
It was such a small door Momo had to bend down and crawl.

512
2104
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:22,088
On the turtle's back, appeared the words, "We've arrived"

513
2108
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:29,404
There was a sign in front of the bent over Momo

514
2112
00:40:29,404 --> 00:40:35,698
It said, "The professor of time."

515
2116
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:03,302
Only until here today, sleep now.

516
2120
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,900
Because uncle is tired.

517
2124
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,400
My head hurts too.

518
2128
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,400
My heart too.

519
2132
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,400
This is where the heart is.

520
2136
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,200
Later on don't meet any men like your uncle, okay?

521
2140
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:43,487
Hey, you should have said, "Uncle is the most handsome. Later on, I'll marry someone like you, Uncle." Like that.

522
2144
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:46,649
It's funny?

523
2148
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:51,155
In life, do you know any other men as handsome as your uncle?

524
2152
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:55,534
Sleep now. Turn off the light.

525
2156
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,600
Shall I sing you a bedtime song?

526
2160
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:14,070
When mother went to the island

527
2164
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:20,870
to gather oysters,

528
2168
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:29,030
The baby was left alone

529
2172
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:36,490
to stay in the house.

530
2176
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,010
Listening to the sea's lullaby

531
2180
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:51,270
played by the waves,

532
2184
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,560
With his arm as a pillow he fell asleep.

533
2188
00:44:15,537 --> 00:44:17,403
Did you clean my office today?

534
2192
00:44:17,403 --> 00:44:19,673
Yes, I did it president.

535
2196
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,000
Where is the garbage?

536
2200
00:44:21,498 --> 00:44:23,350
What? The Garbage?

537
2204
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,357
The garbage can is empty. Where is the garbage?

538
2208
00:44:25,357 --> 00:44:27,245
Of course, it's in the garbage dumpster.

539
2212
00:44:33,492 --> 00:44:37,103
Even his back silhouette is art...

540
2216
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,260
♫ <i>After receiving a toy, he looks at it</i> ♫

541

542
2224

543
2228
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:52,780
♫ <i>the people who gave it to him like a child.</i> ♫

544
2232
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,000
<i>Are you praying in the men's restroom?</i>

545
2236
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,100
<i>Not even 1 second, one minute, I don't like it. </i>

546
2240
00:46:08,927 --> 00:46:11,275
<i> Know it's the end if you leave now. </i>

547
2244
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,146
<i> Hee hee, it came out. </i>

548
2248
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,596
<i> You think I won't hit you? </i>

549
2252
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:20,279
<i> Okay then.
Let's work together. </i>

550
2257
00:46:25,421 --> 00:46:26,850
<i> Did you make that money yourself?<i></i></i>

551
2261
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,391
<i> Using your parents money?
What makes you so great? </i>

552
2266
00:46:36,382 --> 00:46:37,924
<i> Why didn't you close your eyes this time? </i>

553
2270
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,700
<i>My beautiful person!</i>

554
2274
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:57,600
<i>My beautiful person!
My beautiful person!</i>

555
2279
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,900
Oh, this is good.

556
2283
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,400
<i>Mt. Halla on Jeju Island
July 7 "My Birthday"</i>

557
2288
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:34,400
<i>Standing there, the clouds at my feet...</i>

558
2292
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,500
<i>It felt like I was standing on the clouds.</i>

559
2296
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,357
<i>I said at that time.</i>

560
2300
00:47:41,073 --> 00:47:43,109
<i>Now it's over. Let's stop.</i>

561
2304
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,300
<i>Both blaming myself and despair. </i>

562
2308
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,000
<i>And I decided. When Hee jin came back,</i>

563
2312
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,900
<i>To at least avoid showing Hee jin, myself, trapped at a standstill.<i></i></i>

564
2316
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,400
President..

565
2320
00:48:41,357 --> 00:48:43,038
What are you looking for?

566
2324
00:48:43,038 --> 00:48:45,792
What... Oh, nothing.

567
2328
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,900

<i>I'm borrowing your hiking clothes and boots.<i></i></i>

569

00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,232
<i>I'll go to Mt. Halla.</i>

570
2340
00:49:17,742 --> 00:49:22,531
After I come back, I'm starting anew.
Expect me.

571
2345
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,400
[Sam Shik]

572
2349
00:49:40,339 --> 00:49:41,922
What, again about Sam Soon?

573
2353
00:49:41,922 --> 00:49:43,007
I have something to say.

574
2357
00:49:43,007 --> 00:49:44,332
Isn't  it all finished?

575
2361
00:49:44,332 --> 00:49:45,669
It's still not finished.

576
2365
00:49:45,669 --> 00:49:47,110
Are you talking back to me?

577
2369
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,406
I'm sorry, but..

578
2373
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,800
I'm not scared of anything except Sam Soon right now.

579
2377
00:49:52,487 --> 00:49:54,611
Tell it to me. I will pass on the message.

580
2381
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:55,701
I'm going to say it to her directly.

581
2385
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:59,019
I told you to tell me. 
How can I bring someone who isn't here?

582
2390
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:00,340
Where did she go?

583
2394
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,078
You don't need to know!

584
2398
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:04,927
You can't do this. You might regret it later...

585
2402
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,265
Wow, even threats now?

586
2406
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,500
Sister in law...

587
2410
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:10,110
Why are you calling me that?

588
2414
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,700
Don't be like that. Who knows? We might just become family.

589
2418
00:50:14,425 --> 00:50:17,918
I'm so...I'm at a loss.
Careful what you say!

590
2423
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,800
Do you have a reason to spout nonsense?

591
2427
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,100
Ah, who is making that noise I hear out there?

592
2431
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,700
I'm sure something made a sound...

593
2435
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,000
Who parked like this here?

594
2439
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:42,900
Gosh.  Totally without consideration to park in front of someone's front door. How could they?

595
2443
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,600
Next time, I'll call the towing truck just like that!

596
2447
00:51:01,366 --> 00:51:03,908
Sister-in-law must like me as well.

597
2451
00:51:03,908 --> 00:51:05,364
W-w-what?

598
2455
00:51:05,364 --> 00:51:07,580
That's why you helped me hide.

599
2459
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:17,859
I'm so...You really are stupidly persistent, huh?

600
2463
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,400
I can't give Sam Soon to a guy like you. EVER!

601
2467
00:51:35,549 --> 00:51:38,394
<i>Why aren't you answering my calls. 
Hurry up and take my call. Sam Shik.</i>

603

00:52:31,658 --> 00:52:33,227
<i>I'm sorry.
Sam Shik.</i>

607
2496
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,900
Why are you sorry?

608
2500
00:52:59,516 --> 00:53:00,812
Yes?

609
2504
00:53:00,812 --> 00:53:03,122
She left this here.

610
2508
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,800
What are you sorry for?

611
2512
00:53:05,884 --> 00:53:07,000
Everything.

612
2516
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,723
What, everything?

613
2520
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,600
Just everything

614
2524
00:53:14,936 --> 00:53:16,607
Can you keep a promise?

615
2528
00:53:18,522 --> 00:53:20,996
That you won't make Sam Soon cry ever again.

616
2532
00:53:22,136 --> 00:53:23,006
Yes.

617
2536
00:53:23,006 --> 00:53:27,311
I'm not saying it's okay to date. I'm just telling you where she went.

618
2540
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,600
Yes.

619
2544
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,500
She went to Jeju Do.

620
2548
00:53:31,466 --> 00:53:33,392
Why did she got to Jejudo?

621
2552
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,300
Hello, one ticket please.

622
2556
00:53:41,707 --> 00:53:43,342
Thank you, you're working hard!

623
2560
00:53:43,342 --> 00:53:45,355
Go well.

624
2564
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,700
Yes...

625
2568
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,700
Yes this is it...

626
2572
00:54:01,474 --> 00:54:02,630
Let's end it.

627
2576
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:05,392
Self-blame and despair.

628
2580
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,100
I've lived only 30 years, and I have many more days to live.

629
2584
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,600
If we meet some day far off in the future,

630
2588
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,600
I at least won't show him a pitiful image.

631
2592
00:54:17,756 --> 00:54:22,644
Even though I liked you, without you, I will live well.

632
2596
00:54:22,644 --> 00:54:24,181
I'll say it boldly.

633
2600
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:28,372
Okay, I'm going to start again from now on.

634
2604
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,400
I'm not the woman Kim Hee Jin. I'm the Patissier Kim Hee Jin.

635
2608
00:54:41,674 --> 00:54:44,997
I'm so tired. What is this about climbing to the top...lunch...ugh...

636
2612
00:54:45,287 --> 00:54:50,419
If I come here again, I'm going to die.

637
2616
00:54:54,883 --> 00:54:56,869
<i>Hiking to the summit is prohibited after 13:00
Descending time at the top 14:30</i>

638
2621
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,900
Ah, there is only one hour left.

639
2625
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,700
Oh, that jerk.

640
2629
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,400
If I fall, my nose will break.

641
2633
00:55:12,283 --> 00:55:14,908
"Standing on the clouds" and nonsense

642
2637
00:55:14,908 --> 00:55:18,356
Is he lying or a pro?

643
2641
00:55:19,882 --> 00:55:25,808
Why did I trust such cliche words?

644
2645
00:55:29,048 --> 00:55:29,664
Oh my back.

645
2649
00:55:32,072 --> 00:55:34,364
If I even see him in my dreams,

646
2653
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:38,052
I'm going to get him for this.

647
2657
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,600
Oh my god! Oh, it's hard.

648
2661
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,900
MOM!

649
2665
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:50,686
What the heck! You can't see anything!

650
2669
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,800
This guy lied about coming all the way up here!

651
2673
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:03,736
I'm Kim Hee Jin!!

652
2677
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,700
I'm not Kim Sam Soon!

653
2681
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,100
I'm Kim Hee Jin!

654
2685
00:56:12,847 --> 00:56:18,135
Sam Shik!!

655
2689
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:26,209
Now...it's really over!!!

656
2693
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,500
Who said you could do that?

657
2697
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,838
Now I'm even hallucinating, hallucinating!

658
2701
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:49,196
I can't fall apart here.

659
2705
00:56:49,196 --> 00:56:51,361
Get yourself together
Get your self together!

660
2710
00:56:51,361 --> 00:56:53,514
Sam Soon! No, I mean Hee Jin!

661
2714
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,400
Get yourself together!

662
2718
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:01,881
What are you doing?

663
2722
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:06,647
You're the one that called for me. What's with the surprise?

664
2726
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,900
Why are you here?

665
2730
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:12,239
Are you...Did you come to push me off here?!

666
2734
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,700
Do you know how long I waited for you?

667
2738
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:19,774
And... who said you could be Kim Hee Jin?

668
2742
00:57:19,774 --> 00:57:21,936
I said I liked Sam Soon!
