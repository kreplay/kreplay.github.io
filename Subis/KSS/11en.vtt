00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,815
<i>Let's first go.</i>

00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,550
<i>Do you really like men that much?<i></i></i>

6
24

<i>Anytime?</i>

00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:29,930
<i>You...are charming.</i>

36
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,932
Didn't I tell you not to talk nonsense?

10
40
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,201
It is not nonsense!

11
44
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:38,840
Don't see any other guys, and don't go on any more blind dates.

12
48
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,341
I don't like you meeting other guys!

13
52
00:00:43,112 --> 00:00:44,778
I really don't like it!

14
56
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:49,316
Then what...?

15
60
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,086
What do you want me to do?

16
64
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,519
I just told you. Don't meet other guys

17
68
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,295
until you pay me back the $50,000.

18
72
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,097
You crazy bastard!

19
76
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,195
So, that's what it's about. For $50,000?

20
80
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,541
You damn player!

21
84
00:01:22,451 --> 00:01:24,348
Get lost!

22
88
00:01:24,348 --> 00:01:26,753
Your get lost, bastard!

23
92
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,655
If you look like that, what's going to happen?

24
96
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,489
Is it fun playing with money?

25
100
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,228
Enough!

26
104
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,900
Stop it!

27

00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,771
You... leave!

00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,312
Leave... I told you to leave.

29
116
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,116
We aren't going to be meeting each other again in the future, so leave.

30
120
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:01,853
I told you to leave. Leave! Leave! Leave!

31
124
00:02:06,162 --> 00:02:08,259
Why don't you hurry up and leave!

32
128
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,268
Are you deaf?

33
132
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:18,560
I told you to leave!

34
136
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,200

00:04:57,266 --> 00:05:02,038

60

00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:05,139
and the other jerk is a crazy pervert!

61

Why do only the useless jerks get attracted to me?

62

What's the use of spending a fortune, straightening my hair?

63

What's the use of taking my sister's pretty clothes to wear?

64
256
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,588
What's the use of spending $30 to buy a lipstick?

Don't go so fast!

86
346
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:13,294
Good job!

87
350
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:15,763
You should crush that player!

88
354
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:18,598
If not, he will probably think he's cool.

89
358
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:25,272
He's not a player.  
Returning to his old girlfriend makes him a player?

90
363
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,577
Didn't he tell you not to see other men?

91
367
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:29,379
Then will he break up with Yoo Hee Jin?

92
371
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,045
I didn't ask about that though.

93
375
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:33,247
There's no point asking.

94
379
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:36,751
Do you know what you are to that jerk?

95
383
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,220
You don't fully meet his needs ...

96
387
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,122
He's just using you to pass time.

97
391
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:42,457
What?

98
395
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,693
You really are tenacious.

99
399
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:47,395
Do you really want to say those cruel words?

100
403
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:51,933
You don't even have courage, yet you're trying to be a nice person?!

101
407
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:57,005
Just wait a little.  After the apartment gets sold, let's open up our own store!

102
411
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:58,372
Store?!

103
415
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,007
Let's go!

104
419
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:04,112
What store is she talking about?

105
423
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:05,646
Go straight!

106
427
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,150
Fighting! Wait for me!

107
431
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,818
Not just bread, but you are saying you need a patissier?

108
435
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:11,387
Yes.

109
439
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:14,021
Then why did you let Sam Soon quit?

110
443
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,289
Did X-Man say that?

111
447
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,694
What? X-Man?

112
451
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:19,893
The spy that President Na sent!

113
455
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:25,166
Why are you so shocked? Weren't we playing along together?

114
459
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,468
Anyway, why did Sam Soon quit?

115
463
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:29,503
President Na doesn't need to know this.

116
467
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:32,374
Just lend me a baker until I find someone else.

117
471
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:35,110
Shut up! This is your problem. You sort it out yourself. I don't care.

118
475
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,977
Then can I just ask Chris?

119
479
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:37,978
Do whatever you want.

120
483
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,044
I will then.

121
487
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:50,127
I know who X-Man is so stop playing Go-Stop. 
Don't end up with Pi-Bak.<i> [Being penalized in Go-Stop]</i>

122
492
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:51,859
Why you little...

123
496
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,093
Hey!

124
500
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:56,530
Come in!

125
504
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:03,271
Has X-Man been caught?

126
508
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,605
What's X-Man?

127
512
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,804
That guy from the restaurant!

128
516
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,211
But what do you mean, "get caught?"

129
520
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:13,481
Jin Hyun says he knows who it is!

130
524
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:14,282
How?

131
528
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:15,949
That's why I'm asking right now!

132
532
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:20,255
First, we start a online store on the internet.

133
536
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:22,689
Then when business gets good, we'll open up a real shop.

134
540
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,692
It's for real right?

135
544
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:25,993
Really?

136
548
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:30,164
I put the apartment on sale for under the market value, so it will probably sell fast.

137
552
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,567
After we sell it, pay back the $50,000,

138
556
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,769
then use the rest of the money for business.

139
560
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,572
Sister.

140
564
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:38,173
No need to feel moved.

141
568
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:40,710
You are great at making cakes anyway.

142
572
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,710
You make the cakes, and I will sell manage.

143
576
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,345
Don't you get the "feel"?

144
580
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:45,780
"Feel" is coming.

145
584
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,648
It's coming fast!

146
588
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:51,718
Anyway, the Miller Sisters is going to create a problem.

147
592
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,488
It's time to spread our wings.

148
596
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:54,789
Spread our wings!

149
600
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:57,057
Feeling... feeling...

150
604
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,860
Where are you going? Come do the rest!

151
608
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,864
Hey!

152
612
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:02,664
Catch me!

153
616
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:05,201
Hey!

154
620
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:08,101
Yes, it would be good to have that much experience,

155
624
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:12,140
and if it's  someone who is responsible and diligent, 
it'll be even better.

156
629
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,343
If there's skill, then we can always negotiate the salary.

157
633
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:21,815
Yes, so please take care of it.

158
637
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:28,088
You're not the only pastry chef around.

159
641
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,299
<i>Summer 2005
The sweet seduction begins.</i>

160
646
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:59,320
Exhale while lifting the thigh, arm in the front.. Slowly.

161
650
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,055
Once again ... Inhale... Exhale...

162
654
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:09,796
Should I call her?

163
658
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,064
No. Just wait and see.

164
662
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:25,078
She's the prettiest one...

165
666
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,413
I know.

166
670
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:30,050
It's such a waste...

167
674
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,754
She'd look a lot better than Ok Joo Hyun, if she gains some weight.

168
678
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:37,959
Who's Ok Joo Hyun?

169
682
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:40,093
You don't know? Fin.K.L?

170
686
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,829
What is Fin.K.L? A new ice cream?

171
690
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,902
Oh gosh...

172
694
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:52,976
Let's go.

173
698
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:54,908
You're not going to meet Hee Jin?

174
702
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,577
Not today.

175
706
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,820
Excuse me.

176
710
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,223
What a handsome looking guy!

177
714
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,823
I know!

178
718
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:17,465
I'm sorry!

179
722
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,265
Are you okay?

180
726
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:42,056
Welcome!

181
730
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:44,926
Hello.

182
734
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:47,328
Come in.

183
738
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,089
Thank you.

184
742
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,604
Come here!

185
746
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:36,343
Come here! Is he really that good looking up close?

186
750
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:41,180
He's not human. He's like a statue!

187
754
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:45,820
Is that the woman who pushed Sam Soon away?

188
758
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,791
That's right! She's the old girlfriend.

189
762
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,391
Sam Soon can't compete with her...

190
766
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,361
Yeah... If it was me, I would pick her.

191
770
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,864
I still think Sam Soon is better!

192
774
00:14:56,864 --> 00:15:00,067
What is she like? Looks like a pair of chopsticks!

193
778
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:05,241
What kind of blessing was she born with  to have our president as her boyfriend,

194
782
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:08,443
and have such a good looking man as a friend!

195
786
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,100
That's what I'm saying!

196
790
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,626
Should we put in some more chili paste?

197
794
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,100
It's enough!

198
798
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,265
Is is good?

199
802
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,200
Why? You want some?

200
806
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,469
No.

201
810
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:38,040
You are probably the only unemployed girl eating steak in all of South Korea.

202
814
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,307
You think I want to?

203
818
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:44,411
You try eating a steak with no seasoning. It's torture!

204
822
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:47,181
There are so many ways of losing weight. Why choose this method?

205
826
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,516
How many times do I have to tell you?

206
830
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:54,322
The worst enemy to dieting is carbohydrates!

207
834
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:59,761
As if steak is not enough, wearing a $300 pajamas!
You senseless wench.

208
839
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:03,864
Stop it mom. It's her last struggle.

209
843
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:12,472
What kind of meat is this... so tough. 
Isn't this from a working cow!

210
848
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:19,514
How is the food?

211
852
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:21,116
It's good!

212
856
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:23,283
It's nothing, really.

213
860
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:26,116
By the way...

214
864
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:29,300
Is Sophie here? I had a question I wanted to ask her.

215
868
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,100
She's not working here anymore.

216
872
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,000
What are you going to ask her?

217
876
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,500
It's nothing...

218
880
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,600
Don't worry about it.

219
884
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:45,939
It must be someone's birthday at the guesthouse.
It's because of a cake.

220
889
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:50,943
She doesn't have that much spare time.  
Just buy it from anywhere.

221
894
00:16:55,017 --> 00:16:59,887
Oh, because she's busy looking for a new job.

222
898
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,398
Eat.

223
902
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,511
You want to sleep over?

224
906
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:25,847
No, I have something to do at home.

225
910
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:26,881
What?

226
914
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:28,817
Just this and that...

227
918
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,618
Then come drink some tea and then go...

228
922
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:34,520
I drank a lot of tea today. If I drink anymore, I'm not going to be able to sleep.

229
926
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,926
I feel like a widow throwing a tantrum.

230
930
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:42,631
Oh! Where can you find such a pretty widow?

231
934
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:44,731
Someone would've taken you already.

232
938
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:51,138
I'm going... Get home safely!

233
942
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:32,546
It's so good!

234
946
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:42,392
This is really good. This is heaven.

235
950
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:44,724
There is not much in life.

236
954
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:50,530
Today, I'll eat what I can. I can start dieting again tomorrow!

237
958
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,500
<i>Sam Shik</i>

238
962
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:22,186
Hello?

239
966
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:24,554
Why weren't you answering your phone?

240
970
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:26,927
I asked why you didn't answer the phone?

241
974
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,932
Because I didn't want to...

242
978
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:32,498
When are you coming to take the bike?

243
982
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,402
Oh that's right! The bike!

244
986
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:36,336
Come and take it now.

245
990
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:40,707
Right now? I'll come pick it up tomorrow!

246
994
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,645
No, you have to come take it now!

247
998
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Do you know what time it is?

248
1002
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:48,349
Do you know how much stress this bike gave me?

249
1006
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:51,419
Why? Did the bike say something?

250
1010
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,054
Yes, it speaks so much I can't sleep at night.

251
1014
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:56,190
Hurry and take it!

252
1018
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,527
Just endure it for one more day. 
 I'll come tomorrow morning and get it!

253
1023
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,400
<i>Come and take it right now, or I'm going to trade it in for candy.</i>

254
1027
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,790
♫ <i>What's the matter with me that I'm doing this?</i> ♫

255
1031
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,540
♫ <i> Why is some one like me in a tizzy? </i>♫

256
1035
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:33,500
♫ <i> But it's never happened twice to me. </i>♫

257
1039
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:44,290
♫<i> No way is it because you have some to see me .</i>♫

258
1043
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Take this with you too.

259
1047
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,091
Is it nice, not having to work?

260
1051
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:04,591
It's Nilniri Mambo (a song about being carefree).

261
1055
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,759
You'll gain more weight if you don't work.

262
1059
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,930
Why worry?

263
1063
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,597
Looks like you already gained some.

264
1067
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:12,063
Just mind your own business, Mister President.

265
1071
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:17,069
Be careful not to scratch the door on your way out!

266
1075
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,470
We'll see about that...

267
1079
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,300
<i>"Momo"</i>

268
1083
00:22:25,348 --> 00:22:28,414
Oh, Mi Joo asked me to buy her that...

269
1087
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:42,697
Did you ride it?

270
1091
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:43,865
No!

271
1095
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,632
My tires are flat!

272
1099
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:46,868
Really?

273
1103
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,866
Did you pop it on purpose?

274
1107
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,700
Am I a kid?

275
1111
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:54,641
Men, until they are fathers, are all kids.

276
1115
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,210
Really, old lady?

277
1119
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:56,811
What!?

278
1123
00:22:56,811 --> 00:23:00,513
Aren't all women past the age of thirty old ladies?

279
1127
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:04,553
Do you have anything to pump the wheel back up?

280
1131
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:06,087
Nope, I don't have things like that.

281
1135
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:07,721
It won't work then.

282
1139
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,490
You're going to give me a ride right?

283
1143
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,524
What?

284
1147
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:15,567
Then, do you expect me to carry this from here all the way home?

285
1151
00:23:19,402 --> 00:23:21,770
Turn some music on.

286
1155
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,803
Let's just go like this.

287
1159
00:23:25,475 --> 00:23:26,841
Why do you keep getting mad?

288
1163
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:27,875
When was I?

289
1167
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,412
You've been angry this from before!

290
1171
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:32,679
Just mind your own business, old lady!

291
1175
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:40,621
What did you do with Min Hyun Woo that night?

292
1179
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:44,859
What did you do?

293
1183
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:47,194
Just mind your own business, Mister President!

294
1187
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:08,778
<i>Right when my heart starts to settle down, 
he calls me out again.</i>

295
1192
00:24:10,153 --> 00:24:14,891
<i>Is he trying to brag that his side profile's handsome or something?</i>

296
1196
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:17,992
<i>And why are his fingers so long?</i>

297
1200
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:20,830
<i>He's whiter than me.</i>

298
1204
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,960
<i> Anyway, why does he just do things to annoy me?</i>

299
1208
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:26,465
What are you looking at?

300
1212
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:31,071
Aren't you scared of driving?

301
1216
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:32,739
I'm not scared.

302
1220
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:37,712
Then why were taking a taxi?

303
1224
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:40,381
Let's go quietly.

304
1228
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:42,382
Okay.

305
1232
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,910
Pervert, pervert.

306
1236
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,777
Are you saying that to me?

307
1240
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,254
Oh my, you have good hearing! You heard that?

308
1244
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:20,689
Is this your first time hearing me saying bad things?

309
1248
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:22,857
Why is your name Sam Soon?

310
1252
00:25:24,327 --> 00:25:27,596
Are your older sisters named Il (One) Soon and Yee (Two) Soon?

311
1256
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:29,762
You sure are asking so soon.

312
1260
00:25:32,668 --> 00:25:34,832
They thought that I was a boy before I was born,

313
1264
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:37,004
but when a girl just popped out ...

314
1268
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:41,007
my grandfather just named me out of anger.

315
1272
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,878
Then what does $50,000 have to do with your house?

316
1276
00:25:45,949 --> 00:25:48,550
Before my dad passed away,

317
1280
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:54,687
he put up our house as  security when he co-signed for a debt, but it's taking effect now.

318
1284
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,294
But, why are you asking this?

319
1288
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:01,494
Just because.

320
1292
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:05,098
Then let me ask something too!

321
1296
00:26:06,835 --> 00:26:11,142
That day, how did you get out of the bathroom?

322
1300
00:26:11,142 --> 00:26:13,574
X-Man helped me.

323
1304
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:17,044
X-Man? You caught X-Man?

324
1308
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:17,811
Yes.

325
1312
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:20,615
How? Who is it?

326
1316
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:23,319
I can't tell you without anything in return!

327
1320
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,452
So immature!

328
1324
00:26:26,721 --> 00:26:28,856
If you start work again, I'll tell you.

329
1328
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:32,793
Ha, how selfish! Never mind, forget it!

330
1332
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,130
<i>Queen of Smiles</i>

331
1336
00:26:43,205 --> 00:26:44,940
Answer it.

332
1340
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,941
No need.

333
1344
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:48,542
Should I answer for you?

334
1348
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,020
Never mind.

335
1352
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:55,718
Who's the "queen of smiles"?

336
1356
00:26:55,718 --> 00:26:57,885
I said there was no need!

337
1360
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:02,822
Is it Yoo Hee Jin?

338
1364
00:27:06,895 --> 00:27:09,664
Answer it! If not, it seems like you're cheating on her!

339
1368
00:27:09,664 --> 00:27:10,898
Who's cheating?

340
1372
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:12,833
That's why just answer it!

341
1376
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:23,845
Yeah, It's me.

342
1380
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:26,446
I called because I couldn't sleep.

343
1384
00:27:27,651 --> 00:27:28,814
<i>What are you doing?</i>

344
1388
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:34,255
Oh, I'm just listening to music.

345
1392
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:35,923
What are you listening to?

346
1396
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:38,859
Oh, FM radio.

347
1400
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:42,462
Yeah? Then I have to listen too!

348
1404
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:55,409
This reminds me of old times.

349
1408
00:27:55,409 --> 00:28:00,415
We used to listen to the same music and talk on the phone all night.

350
1412
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:08,890
Oh, there's a red light! Stop, stop, stop!

351
1416
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,625
Be careful! Something could have happened!

352
1420
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,428
Is there someone with you?

353
1424
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,170
Jin Hyun?

354
1428
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,140
Jin Hyun?

355
1432
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:36,449
Hee Jin, I'm driving right now. I'll call you later.

356
1436
00:29:15,491 --> 00:29:16,990
What?

357
1440
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:23,230
Get out.

358
1444
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,130
Since we're already here,

359
1448
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,303
why don't you take me all the way to the house?

360
1452
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:28,704
Get out and take your bike!

361
1456
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,639
I don't want to!

362
1460
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:32,773
Since you called me out, take responsibility!

363
1464
00:29:44,385 --> 00:29:46,753
Get out.

364
1468
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:51,258
Ah, so this is how men lie.

365
1472
00:29:51,258 --> 00:29:52,794
Having another woman next to them

366
1476
00:29:52,794 --> 00:29:55,296
and pretending that they are alone.

367
1480
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:57,465
Thanks for the lesson, Sam Shik!

368
1484
00:29:57,465 --> 00:29:59,601
Do you want a lesson fee?

369
1488
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,472
What's wrong with you?

370
1492
00:30:03,472 --> 00:30:05,140
You were the one who did something wrong!

371
1496
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,140
Don't take it out on me!

372
1500
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,875
Kim Sam Soon!

373
1504
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:08,810
What Mr. President?

374
1508
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,014
Don't just make cakes, but learn some manners as well.

375
1512
00:30:11,014 --> 00:30:12,312
Don't worry!

376
1516
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:16,350
Even if I don't have any manners, I won't have an affair!

377
1520
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,953
Who said I'm having an affair?

378
1524
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:20,587
You just did now! You lied!

379
1528
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:24,625
Your face went completely pale.  Do you know how ridiculous you looked?

380
1532
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:28,129
Wh-wh-when did I?

381
1536
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:31,365
Look! You're even stuttering.

382
1540
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:34,269
Also, why are you making me into a fool?

383
1544
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:37,337
Why out of everyrhing did you have me sit right next to you while you lied?!

384
1548
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:38,507
Making me feel dirty!

385
1552
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:40,374
That's why I said I wasn't going to answer!

386
1556
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:44,077
Not answering the phone, is cheating!

387
1560
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:20,914
Hey!

388
1564
00:31:25,486 --> 00:31:27,718
Do you like me?

389
1568
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:33,020
Do you know how weird you were today?

390
1572
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:41,701
Don't think about it. Just say what comes to your mind.

391
1576
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:43,431
Do you like me?

392
1580
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:49,810
Didn't we already have this conversation?

393
1584
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,130
Who wants to have a girl like you?

394
1588
00:31:54,484 --> 00:31:58,819
You are not my type. Do you know why?

395
1592
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:02,923
Your hands aren't pretty.

396
1596
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:05,726
What is this? Pig's feet? Huh?

397
1600
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:12,200
You're not my type either! Do you know why?

398
1604
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,004
You don't know how to tell the truth! Tell the truth!

399
1608
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:21,480
Even for one minute, you haven't thought of me?

400
1612
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:26,046
Did you or didn't you?

401
1616
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:29,870
I haven't.

402
1620
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:35,858
Then, I'll teach you something.

403
1624
00:32:35,858 --> 00:32:38,190
Don't do stuff like this.

404
1628
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,860
Calling a person up in the middle of the night for nothing, getting pissed off, asking me personal questions ...

405
1632
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,531
Do you know what that means?

406
1636
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:49,273
"I... am interested in you."

407
1640
00:32:49,273 --> 00:32:53,470
If you're not interested, don't do these things.

408
1644
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:58,012
Don't make girls misunderstand.

409
1648
00:32:58,012 --> 00:33:00,647
So, did you misunderstand?

410
1652
00:33:05,387 --> 00:33:09,659
Yes. For 59 seconds, I did.

411
1656
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,826
Sorry, for making you misunderstand.

412
1660
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:20,900
♫ <i>But for me you aren't there.</i> ♫

413
1664
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:27,980
♫ <i> Don't look for me.  I've lost </i>♫

Hey! I hope you get a flat tire on the way!

416
1676
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:47,427
I can't believe there are people like him!

422
1700
00:34:31,508 --> 00:34:33,742
Jerk.

423
1704
00:34:33,742 --> 00:34:38,344
I was just sitting at home, and he had to drag me out!

424
1708
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,920
Everything is back to square one.

425
1712
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,920
I've been doing fine for the past few days.

♫ <i> I will call your name like this. </i>♫

427

I'm sorry for calling you before work.

428
1724
00:35:26,726 --> 00:35:29,263
It's okay. It was on my way.

429
1728
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,710
You can tell me now.

430
1732
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:39,506
It was a woman's voice. Were you with Kim Sam Soon?

431
1736
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:42,476
Yeah.

432
1740
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:44,813
Why?

433
1744
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:47,280
She came to take her bike back.

434
1748
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:51,654
Did you help her to bring her bicycle home?

435
1752
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:52,817
Yeah.

436
1756
00:35:54,223 --> 00:35:56,155
Then why did you lie?

437
1760
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:58,492
Sorry.

438
1764
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:01,896
Why? Because you thought I would feel bad?

439
1768
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:03,263
Sorry.

440
1772
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:07,468
If you told me the truth, I would have understood.

441
1776
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:11,240
But I felt bad the whole night.

442
1780
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:14,475
For that too, sorry.

443
1784
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:19,446
Say something.  Whether it's an excuse or an explanations, say something.

444
1788
00:36:25,787 --> 00:36:28,186
I'm really sorry.

445
1792
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:35,462
If you are going to do something, at least don't get caught.

446
1796
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,735
Do you think I'm letting you off? If you do this again!

447
1800
00:36:41,735 --> 00:36:43,770
You're dead!

448
1804
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,272
Do you get it or not?

449
1808
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:49,743
Go!

450
1812
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:58,413
Did you give up on your other diet? Did you decide to start with a vegetable  diet?

451
1816
00:37:58,413 --> 00:38:00,415
Yeah.

452
1820
00:38:00,415 --> 00:38:04,451
You should've done that from the beginning.  We just spent all the money on meat.

453
1824
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,734
Finished.

454
1828
00:38:27,776 --> 00:38:30,670
Oh, my stomach!

455
1832
00:38:37,753 --> 00:38:39,754
Whats the problem? Did you get food poisoning?

456
1836
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:40,988
Yeah, it seems like it!

457
1840
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:44,258
Why did have to just eat grass like a goat?

458
1844
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:47,561
Do you think you'll lose weight like that?  You should do everything in moderation

459
1848
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:50,063
If you don't know anything, just be quiet.

460
1852
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:52,700
Do you think those are ordinary vegetables?

461
1856
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,003
Those vegetables grew eating my blood tears.

462
1860
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,837
You don't even know how I feel.

463
1864
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,985
I can't believe he even followed in my stomach, and torment me.

464
1868
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:14,289
Tenacious jerk.

465
1872
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:16,356
Leaching jerk.

466
1876
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,302
Hey, are you okay?

467
1880
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:30,137
Should I get you some medicine?

468
1884
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:36,576
No, I am just going to mentally endure it till the end...

469
1888
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:39,513
Not taking medication is something Sam Soon would do.

470
1892
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:52,027
Hello? Yes, Manager.

471
1896
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:54,663
Tell them we're not taking these bell peppers.
- Hello.  How are you doing?

472
1901
00:39:54,663 --> 00:39:59,200
I'm always doing fine.  It's so boring and quiet without you here.

473
1905
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,737
Is In Hye doing well?

474
1909
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:07,274
Yes, she's doing fine. And the cakes are still purchased from the hotel.

475
1913
00:40:12,212 --> 00:40:17,419
But Sam Soon ... can I have... your sister's phone number?

476
1917
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:18,820
<i>Why do you want my sister's number?</i>

477
1921
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,824
Oh. I just had something to ask.

478
1925
00:40:22,824 --> 00:40:26,094
<i>I'll put her on the phone.</i>

479
1929
00:40:26,094 --> 00:40:27,161
Answer it.

480
1933
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:27,728
Who is it?

481
1937
00:40:27,728 --> 00:40:30,164
Hurry, take it!

482
1941
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,001
Yes. I've answered the phone.

483
1945
00:40:35,303 --> 00:40:36,570
It's me.

484
1949
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:39,438
Who is "me"?

485
1953
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:43,143
100-dollar-worth man.

486
1957
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:46,980
What's going on?

487
1961
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,584
Let's meet tonight!

488
1965
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:50,784
Why?

489
1969
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:52,486
Didn't you know that money was fake?

490
1973
00:40:52,486 --> 00:40:53,654
Fake money?

491
1977
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:55,323
You don't need to know.

492
1981
00:40:55,323 --> 00:41:01,929
I need to report it to the police, so around 9 o'clock come to the restaurant. That's it.

493
1985
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:07,635
How dare he try to scheme! Why would you go to the police station at 9 PM?

494
1989
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:11,771
Sister, did something happen between you two?

495
1993
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:14,609
What could happen?  I just used him to pass the time.

496
1997
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:17,730
Don't talk to me about that peanut like that!

497
2001
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,214
How could you eat an expensive peanutst to pass the time?

498
2005
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:23,217
Go to the grocery store and you can buy a whole bag for a dollar.

499
2009
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:27,454
But the Korean ones are better and more expensive.

500
2013
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:35,563
Gosh, bringing up peanuts...

501
2017
00:41:42,904 --> 00:41:44,838
What's this?

502
2021
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:47,108
Is my body worth this much to you?

503
2025
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:50,111
If you are going to pay for it... at least pay the right amount.

504
2029
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:53,482
If it's like that, pay 900 more.

505
2033
00:41:53,482 --> 00:41:55,716
Are you saying that you are worth a thousand dollars?

506
2037
00:41:55,716 --> 00:41:57,050
Am I not worth that much?

507
2041
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,219
Then pay me 10,000 dollars, because that's what I'm worth.

508
2045
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,924
Actually, this is mine. Now, give me the 10,000 dollars.

509
2049
00:42:05,861 --> 00:42:08,095
Where else is this kind of woman?

510
2053
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:08,595
Hey!

511
2057
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:09,214
What?

512
2061
00:42:09,214 --> 00:42:10,465
Are the divorcees that expensive?

513
2065
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:11,714
No... I am expensive because I am not a virgin.

514
2069
00:42:11,714 --> 00:42:12,980
Do you know any mature women?

515
2073
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,916
Mature women?

516
2077
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:14,669
You are like a bad joke.

517
2081
00:42:14,669 --> 00:42:18,745
If I am like a bad joke, then you are stupid. 
Hey... you are like a child.

518
2086
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:21,488
How can a woman not lose at talking?!

519
2090
00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:22,408
Do they teach you to fight at home?

520
2094
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:25,546
In order to make you a fighter, do they make you exercise all the time?

521
2098
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:29,684
The first one looks like your mother... you are at the second place, and Sam-Soon  is a welter-weight fighter...

522
2102
00:42:29,684 --> 00:42:33,554
If you have nothing else to say, why don't you go home?

523
2106
00:42:38,594 --> 00:42:40,894
Let's drink with this money.

524
2110
00:42:53,776 --> 00:42:55,373
<i>Do you like me?<i></i></i>

525
2114
00:42:56,977 --> 00:43:01,049
<i>Don't make me misunderstand. Just tell me what you first think of.<i></i></i>

526
2118
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,800
<i>Do you like me?</i>

527
2122
00:43:46,428 --> 00:43:50,197
I am really sleepy, and I am hungry. But still I can't sleep...

528
2126
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:58,472
I still have to memorize a lot of things...I want to eat Samgyupsal (pork belly meat).

529
2130
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:06,182
<i>I want to dip it to the oil, cook it with a little bit garlic and eat it at once.</i>

530
2134
00:44:06,182 --> 00:44:08,582
<i>At least one good thing happened...</i>

531
2138
00:44:08,582 --> 00:44:11,118
<i>Eating with someone,</i>

532
2142
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:13,386
<i>sharing our thoughts.</i>

533
2146
00:44:13,386 --> 00:44:16,723
<i>A quote from Professor Paul.</i>

534
2150
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,956
Are you sick? You lost weight!

535
2154
00:44:47,956 --> 00:44:50,625
What do you want? First tell me what you want.

536
2158
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:51,226
Get in.

537
2162
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:52,160
I'll call my mom!

538
2166
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,365
This will be the last time...

539
2170
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:55,516
Past Christmas was for me the last time.

540
2174
00:44:55,516 --> 00:44:57,331
Don't you think that we should end it officially?

541
2178
00:44:57,331 --> 00:45:00,868
Last Christmas was the end for me. Don't you remember?

542
2182
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:06,342
It's really the last time. Get in.
It's really the last time!

543
2187
00:45:06,342 --> 00:45:07,841
Where are we going?

544
2191
00:45:07,841 --> 00:45:10,912
To a nice place to celebrate our last time.

545
2195
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:16,016
That's too tiring. Do it in our yard with my mom and sister present.

546
2199
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:17,853
Your mom is scary!

547
2203
00:45:17,853 --> 00:45:20,722
This is really the last time! Aren't you being too much?

548
2207
00:45:20,722 --> 00:45:27,594
Fine. If you do anything weird, I won't stay put.

549
2211
00:45:37,138 --> 00:45:43,177
What is the second rule? Those who insult me, I won't let them off.

550
2215
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:44,411
What?

551
2219
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:47,215
-No! Not what, bathing!
 -Oh, insult (sounds similar).

552
2224
00:45:47,215 --> 00:45:51,485
That bastard invited his lover to our house.

553
2228
00:45:51,485 --> 00:45:55,256
Wow, that's messed up.

554
2232
00:45:55,256 --> 00:46:01,896
So, I spilled what I was cooking all over them.

555
2236
00:46:04,632 --> 00:46:06,868
Wow, you're good enough to be Sam-soon's older sister.

556
2240
00:46:06,868 --> 00:46:10,437
Hey! You should say that Sam Soon is good enough to be my younger sister!

557
2244
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,309
Oh, there it is.

558
2248
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:18,514
Oh, it was there...
Where the heck were you?!

559
2253
00:46:18,514 --> 00:46:22,516
Let's hurry up and go.

560
2257
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,500
Let's go.

561
2261
00:46:37,265 --> 00:46:39,066
What are you scheming?

562
2265
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:40,868
You end up bringing me to a hotel room?

563
2269
00:46:40,868 --> 00:46:43,671
What do you think we're doing? We're just going to the bar.

564
2273
00:46:43,671 --> 00:46:46,308
How can I go to the bar dressed like this?

565
2277
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:50,244
It's okay! This bar is nice! And I have a membership.

566
2281
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:52,146
It's a good place to talk quietly.

567
2285
00:46:52,146 --> 00:46:53,882
Let's go somewhere else.

568
2289
00:46:53,882 --> 00:46:56,270
Why? Because of that guy?

569
2293
00:46:57,353 --> 00:47:00,756
You said it was a fake relationship.
Does it bother you?

570
2298
00:47:00,756 --> 00:47:03,557
Anyways, let's go somewhere else.

571
2302
00:47:03,557 --> 00:47:06,757
I don't know anywhere else. Get off.

572
2306
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:30,782
This won't do, let's go somewhere else.

573
2310
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:47,434
We end up meeting each other often.

574
2314
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,174
We're going to have some drinks at the bar.

575
2318
00:47:54,174 --> 00:47:56,030
Do you want to go with us?

576
2322
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200
Are you taking the next one?

577
2326
00:48:31,279 --> 00:48:33,981
Your restaurant is doing well right?

578
2330
00:48:33,981 --> 00:48:34,782
Of course.

579
2334
00:48:34,782 --> 00:48:36,917
Sam Soon suddenly resigned, so it must be difficult on you.

580
2338
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:39,353
There aren't only one or two patissiers.

581
2342
00:48:39,353 --> 00:48:42,989
But, do you think they can match Korea's best patisserie, Sam Soon?

582
2346
00:48:45,326 --> 00:48:48,360
I don't need a patissier who cheats.

583
2350
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:51,934
After confessing her love to a man,

584
2354
00:48:51,934 --> 00:48:54,910
meeting her old boyfriend is cheating.

585
2358
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:13,524
It is going to be difficult to find a new job.

586
2362
00:49:13,524 --> 00:49:16,123
I have told most of the places.

587
2366
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:18,492
That you a person who quits when we don't even have a replacement.

588
2370
00:49:18,492 --> 00:49:21,060
Irresponsible person.

589
2374
00:49:28,972 --> 00:49:30,471
When are you going to lend me your patisserie.

590
2378
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:33,607
Why? I thought you were going to ask Chris personally?

591
2382
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:35,542
He said he can't without your approval.

592
2386
00:49:36,612 --> 00:49:37,811
Give up the restaurant and come work under me.

593
2390
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:38,846
I'm getting tired too.

594
2394
00:49:38,846 --> 00:49:39,614
Please give one patisserie.

595
2398
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:42,816
I heard there are some people who are interested in purchasing your restaurant.

596
2402
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:44,452
President Kim's youngest daughter...

597
2406
00:49:44,452 --> 00:49:46,121
Let me borrow him, President Na!

598
2410
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:48,556
This ill-mannered bastard.

599
2414
00:49:48,556 --> 00:49:50,924
I'm not in a good situation right now!

600
2418
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:02,269
What is it?

601
2422
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:03,871
Let's get married.

602
2426
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,174
I said let's get married.

603
2430
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:12,078
Crazy guy! What about your Chae Ri?

604
2434
00:50:12,078 --> 00:50:14,448
If you accept, I'll cancel.

605
2438
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:18,185
You? Cancel?

606
2442
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:22,623
Saying a bunch of BS.

607
2446
00:50:22,623 --> 00:50:26,160
Hey! Why don't you believe what I say?

608
2450
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,095
Ok! I'll believe you!

609
2454
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:30,699
But first, cancel your engagement!

610
2458
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:37,640
Cancel the engagement and Chae Ri comes to me crying, and pulling my hair. After I see that with my own two eyes.,

611
2462
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,241
then I'll accept you.  You understand?

612
2466
00:50:40,241 --> 00:50:43,176
Seriously? If I cancel it, will you really accept me?

613
2470
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:46,511
You won't cancel it.

614
2474
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:50,017
Do you know why?

615
2478
00:50:50,017 --> 00:50:53,955
Because there is no such thing as truth in your DNA.

616
2482
00:50:53,955 --> 00:50:56,591
What to do?

617
2486
00:50:56,591 --> 00:50:59,827
Even Professor Hwang, so can't fix that.

618
2490
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:42,568
<i>You're not my type either. </i>

619
2494
00:51:42,568 --> 00:51:44,573
<i>Do you know why?</i>

620
2498
00:51:44,573 --> 00:51:47,908
<i>You can't tell the truth.</i>

621
2502
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:49,578
<i>Tell the truth.</i>

622
2506
00:51:49,578 --> 00:51:53,580
<i>Even for one moment, have you never thought of me?</i>

623
2510
00:51:55,718 --> 00:51:57,783
<i>Was there or not?</i>

624
2514
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:02,792
<i>I have never seen love as something easy.</i>

625
2518
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:05,460
<i>Whether there were a lot of hormones or...</i>

626
2522
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,894
<i>I sincerely want to open up.</i>

627
2526
00:52:07,894 --> 00:52:09,796
<i>Sincerely.</i>

628
2530
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:21,508
<i>I've come to like you!</i>

629
2534
00:52:34,591 --> 00:52:36,290
<i>Then Mt. Halla...</i>

630
2538
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:39,961
<i>Why did you say you wanted to go to Mt. Halla with me?</i>

631
2542
00:52:39,961 --> 00:52:50,471
<i>You know...that means, "I like you". Did you know that?</i>

632
2546
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:08,126
Okay. I will cancel the engagement immediately.

633
2550
00:53:08,126 --> 00:53:11,758
Then, call right now.

634
2554
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:13,561
It's a little late right now.

635
2558
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:16,331
Isn't this the best time for players?

636
2562
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:18,998
If it's too much, you want me to do it for me?

637
2566
00:53:18,998 --> 00:53:20,200
Huh?

638
2570
00:53:26,008 --> 00:53:29,943
Hey! Hey! Hey!

639
2574
00:53:33,048 --> 00:53:35,018
Hello, is it you Chae-ri?

640
2578
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:37,580
What are you ...

641
2582
00:53:38,754 --> 00:53:41,554
I really wasn't going to go this far, but

642
2586
00:53:41,554 --> 00:53:44,658
your fiance is messing around with me so much.

643
2590
00:53:44,658 --> 00:53:46,093
I'm tired of it.

644
2594
00:53:46,093 --> 00:53:50,132
Whether you break his legs with a bamboo stick,

645
2598
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:53,302
please make him into a human being.

646
2602
00:53:53,302 --> 00:53:55,967
Oh... Hold on... I'll put him on...

647
2606
00:53:58,942 --> 00:54:00,375
Hey Kim Sam Soon!

648
2610
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:02,176
How dare you yell?

649
2614
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:07,518
Don't touch my woman's stuff.

650
2618
00:54:07,518 --> 00:54:10,184
I said not to meet other men.

651
2622
00:54:11,922 --> 00:54:14,224
Have you not paid the money back?

652
2626
00:54:14,224 --> 00:54:15,989
Should I pay him back?

653
2630
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,926
What's wrong?

654
2634
00:54:25,268 --> 00:54:26,800
Hey, let go!

655
2638
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,606
What are you making a mess? Do I look that easy to you? Am I your toy?

656
2642
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:35,742
You jerk. I told you not to make me misunderstand. I told you not to say a bunch of nonsense.

657
2646
00:54:35,742 --> 00:54:40,047
If I pay back the money everything is fine! I will pay it back!

658
2650
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:43,150
Who do you see me as? I mistook you for a decent person.

659
2654
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,786
Let go!

660
2658
00:55:09,944 --> 00:55:11,345
Did you take drugs?

661
2662
00:55:11,345 --> 00:55:12,589
No.

662
2666
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:14,112
Then, did you drink?

663
2670
00:55:14,112 --> 00:55:14,848
No.

664
2674
00:55:14,848 --> 00:55:17,651
Then, is this a mistake?

665
2678
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:18,987
No.

666
2682
00:55:18,987 --> 00:55:20,053
Then what is it?

667
2686
00:55:20,053 --> 00:55:22,956
Do you want to have an affair like Min Hyun Woo?

668
2690
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:25,594
Don't compare me to that bastard.

669
2694
00:55:25,594 --> 00:55:29,065
You're the same... No, you're worse.

670
2698
00:55:29,065 --> 00:55:29,867
I said that's not it!

671
2702
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:30,465
Then what is it?!

672
2706
00:55:30,465 --> 00:55:32,232
I've come to like you!

673
2710
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:35,369
I like you!

674
2714
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:37,940
I keep thinking of you. It drives me crazy!

675
2718
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,611
Why did you have to come inside my head and bother me?

676
2722
00:55:39,611 --> 00:55:42,742
Why?! You might as well get lost.

677
2726
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:53,821
Alright, I'll get lost.

678
2730
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:03,761
Cancel the last thing I said.

679
2734
00:56:07,768 --> 00:56:10,203
Who the heck are you to scream at me?

680
2738
00:56:13,274 --> 00:56:15,309
Did I piss you off?

681
2742
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:17,741
How much did I bother you...

682
2746
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:24,184
What good did you do? What good did you do that can yell at me like this?!

683
2750
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,487
Sorry.

684
2754
00:56:30,324 --> 00:56:32,793
I said I was sorry.

685
2758
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:46,606
Stop. This is the men's restroom.

686
2762
00:56:46,606 --> 00:56:48,442
That's why.

687
2766
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:53,681
Why of all places here?

688
2770
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:56,850
You know how much I suffered here.

689
2774
00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:05,460
I don't expect much, but why here of all places?!

690
2778
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,694
Okay. Sorry.

691
2782
00:57:11,499 --> 00:57:14,096
Why is it so hard?

692
2786
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:15,569
Huh?

693
2790
00:57:18,507 --> 00:57:22,643
If you like, then you like. And if you don't like, then you don't like.

694
2794
00:57:22,643 --> 00:57:25,312
Why is it so difficult and complicated?

695
2798
00:57:29,883 --> 00:57:31,652
It's tiring.

696
2802
00:57:35,257 --> 00:57:39,193
I'm seriously tired to death.

697
2806
00:57:47,868 --> 00:57:51,030
Today, it isn't black tears.

698
2810
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:56,977
Then, this late at night I have to come out with makeup on?

699
2814
00:58:14,862 --> 00:58:17,131
What's going to happen to Hee Jin?

700
2818
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:19,200
It pisses me off.

701
2822
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,637
The thing that upsets me the most is cheating.

702
2826
00:58:26,775 --> 00:58:30,078
It's me, Yoo Hee Jin.

703
2830
00:58:36,818 --> 00:58:37,985
You believe those words?

704
2834
00:58:37,985 --> 00:58:39,154
I want to believe them.

705
2838
00:58:39,154 --> 00:58:41,355
How many times do I have to say you're just a game?

706
2842
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:42,890
So you still want to believe him?

707
2846
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,692
Yes. I still want to believe him.

708
2850
00:58:48,927 --> 00:58:50,464
Can you give it to me?

709
2854
00:58:56,204 --> 00:58:57,672
So?

710
2858
00:58:57,672 --> 00:58:58,906
Really?

711
2862
00:58:58,906 --> 00:59:01,209
Are you really done?

712
2866
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,414
Going and coming back, I'll start over.

713
2870
00:59:06,414 --> 00:59:07,680
Wait.
