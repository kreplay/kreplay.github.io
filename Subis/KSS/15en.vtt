11
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:12,672
<i>Jin Hun...</i>

4
15
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:14,226
<i>This isn't your business to worry about anymore.</i>

5
19
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:18,961
<i>I don't want this pity from you.</i>

6
23
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:25,353
<i>Kim Sam Soon won't like it if she finds out.</i>

7
27
00:00:25,353 --> 00:00:25,779
<i>She'll understand.</i>

8
31
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,500
<i>Jin Hun.</i>

9
35
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:30,795
<i>Sam Shik!<i></i></i>

10
39
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:34,152
<i>I...I'll never be able to forget you.</i>

11
43
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:37,532
<i>You're like a stone in my heart... that can't be moved.</i>

12
47
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:07,403
<i>Just wait for a second.</i>

13
51
00:01:53,337 --> 00:01:53,836
<i>I'm going to go.</i>

14
55
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,638
<i>It's okay.</i>

15
59
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:58,306
<i>But, I'm not okay.</i>

16
63
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:00,944
<i>Just lie down. 
 I'm going to go talk outside.</i>

17
68
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,300
Don't misunderstand. 
 A situation occurred.

18
73
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,764
What kind of situation?

19
77
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,954
Hee Jin...is sick.

20
81
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:27,553
I'm sick too

21
85
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:30,225
My inside's hurt so much, that I'm going to faint.

22
89
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:31,547
My inside's hurt so much, that I'm going to faint.

23
93
00:02:31,547 --> 00:02:32,157
She's really sick.

24
97
00:02:32,157 --> 00:02:33,285
She's really sick.

25
101
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:36,333
Where is she ill?   Is it serious?

26
105
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:41,588
-She won't eat anything. 
- Why not?

27
110
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:43,304
She has anorexia.

28
114
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:48,079
So?  You plan on being with her all night?

29
118
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,198
How can I leave her by herself?

30
122
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:51,298
She has Henry.

31
126
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,443
You're not a doctor, so why do you have to be with her?

32
130
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:56,186
I'm going to take her there tomorrow.

33
134
00:02:58,446 --> 00:02:59,039
I don't like it.

34
138
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,450
Send her home, right now.

35
142
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:08,683
What?   You don't want to send her away?

36
146
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:10,114
-You don't trust me? 
 -It's not that I don't trust you...

37
151
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,292
I just can't trust your memories when you two were together.

38
155
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,322
Let's spend some time all together then.

39
159
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,616
Sam Soon...

40
163
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:47,577
What are you going to do because you're not eating?

41
167
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:51,810
What do you want to eat?                                                                            I'll make it for you.

42
171
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,571
Sam Soon, I think it's late...

43
175
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:58,496
No. Your body needs to be strong
if you want your heart to be strong, too.

44
180
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:01,586
Just say anything, and I'll make everything for you.

45
184
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,953
Sam Soon...

46
188
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:08,174
Please, make me something.

47
192
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:12,331
Make me something tasty.

48
196
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:14,165
I'll eat it.

49
200
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:18,555
But, please make it tomorrow.

50
204
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,298
Since, it's too late right now...

51
208
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,672
Alright.

52
212
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:28,718
Then, I'll make it by the time you're up tomorrow.

53
216
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:32,362
Then...I guess I'll have to sleep here.

54
220
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,574
Then, I guess I'll just sleep on the sofa.

55
224
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,113
Get me a blanket.

56
228
00:04:58,742 --> 00:04:59,755
I asked for a blanket.

57
232
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,828
I'll go.

58
236
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:13,523
I'm going to go. I wanted to leave anyways...

59
240
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:17,547
I'm leaving.  Don't come out.

60
244
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:21,025
Wait! Don't leave.

61
248
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,164
Why?

62
252
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,328
Do you not like to be under the same roof as me?

63
256
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,954
Yes.  I'm uncomfortable.

64
260
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:38,061
You really can't stand it?

65
264
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Yes.

66
268
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:52,298
Then, I'll go.

67
272
00:05:57,554 --> 00:05:58,200
I'll go.

68
276
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,368
Take care of her well.

69
280
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,100
Hey, 50 Million Won.

70
284
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:47,878
You have such a great life.

71
288
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:49,365
Your owner has come back, and you don't even say, "Hi"?

72
292
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:00,217
Have you dated?

73
296
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,638
Why is dating so hard?

74
300
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:11,165
Don't fall in love. 
 You're going to suffer way too much.

75
305
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:16,724
Just take care of the household and be faithful to your owner, okay?

76
309
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:26,589
<i> Our Hun. </i>

77
313
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,188
<i>Did you make it back safely? </i>

78
317
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:38,627
-Yeah. 
 -What did you take?

79
322
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:43,434
The buses were done for the day, so I took a taxi.

80
326
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:45,247
Take the subway next time. 
 It's dangerous.

81
331
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:51,765
Sam Soon.

82
335
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:54,943
<i> Thanks. </i>

83
339
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,100
What for?

84
343
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,305
For everything.

85
347
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:04,597
You're just saying this?

86
351
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:17,931
Sleep well.

87
355
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:21,529
You too.

88
359
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:46,856
Hey, I changed my mind. Fall in love. Sure, it'll be tiring, frustrating, and you're heart will ache,

89
363
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:50,357
but, falling in love is the best.

90
367
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,800
I can just look at you, and you'll have a fate of a princess,

91
371
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:57,874
but once you get older, I'll help you find love, okay?

92
375
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:00,988
Sleep well!

93
379
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:05,004
You still won't talk to me no matter what I say!

94
383
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,534
What are you doing?

95
387
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:08,939
You scared me!

96
391
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,637
It's not like you're a thief...
Why are you so stunned?

97
396
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:15,036
You scared me. 
You should've warned me if you were this close to me.

98
401
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,246
Why the kimchi?

99
405
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,766
What is all this?

100
409
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:23,341
It's porridge.

101
413
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:26,670
Someone's sick.

102
417
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:30,425
Is it Hun?

103
421
00:10:33,784 --> 00:10:35,448
You should've told me from the beginning.

104
425
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,539
My goodness...how did our Hun get ill?

105
429
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:40,469
Did he catch a cold?

106
433
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:51,339
It's to watery! 
 What kind of porridge is this?

107
438
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:54,733
If I knew this was the case, I would've made it for you.

108
442
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:03,801
You...being pregnant was all a lie, right?

109
446
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,678
When I was carrying you guys, I couldn't smell kimchi.

110
450
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:17,908
I continued on like I didn't know to let you marry before too late.

111
454
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm sorry, mom.

112
458
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:27,811
But I'm still so worried.  It's not just a regular family, and letting you marry off to a man from a family like that..

113
462
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:31,236
I don't feel that good knowing my youngest child  will have to go through emotional pains by marrying such a rich family.

114
466
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:33,886
And you're dad would probably punish me letting you do that.

115
470
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,354
I'm going to do well, mom.

116
474
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:51,042
Is she still asleep?

117
478
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:52,289
She left.

118
482
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:53,662
What?

119
486
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:54,111
When?

120
490
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,047
When I woke up, she wasn't here. 
 I guess she left before sunrise.

121
495
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:02,529
She must have been upset after what I did last night, right?

122
499
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:05,539
It's probably not comfortable for her to be alone with me as well.

123
503
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:09,993
Where does she live? You know her address, right?

124
507
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:10,886
You're going to go over there?

125
511
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:12,453
I brought porridge.

126
515
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:14,264
Don't go.  It'll just be uncomfortable.

127
519
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:18,316
I know. But, I'm going to ignore the uncomfortable feelings inside.

128
523
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:19,906
Is health not more important?

129
527
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:24,273
Do you not trust me?

130
531
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:32,270
What's with that laugh?

131
535
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,077
I trust you.  Go.

132
539
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:34,893
Go ahead.

133
543
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:06,679
Hee Jin, it's me.

134
547
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,261
W-What brings you here?

135
551
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:11,618
Please open the door. 
 I brought porridge, and I'll leave once I drop it off.

136
556
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:12,665
Porridge?

137
560
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:16,225
I told you that I'd make you something delicious in the morning.

138
564
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:17,308
I packed porridge in here.

139
568
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:23,455
I'm sorry, but I'm not really in the mood.

140
572
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:25,515
Don't be like this and just open the door, please?

141
576
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:27,474
It's not right to speak to your guests outside, is it not?

142
580
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,509
I'm not doing this because I like you either...

143
584
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:51,077
so please don't be like this.

144
588
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:54,137
Where's the kitchen?

145
592
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:01,420
Is it here?

146
596
00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:05,608
So heavy.

147
600
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,044
My mom is excellent at making kimchi.

148
604
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:13,516
I told her that my friend was sick, so she packed some for me.

149
608
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:19,097
Lots has been packed, so take your time eating this. 
 Understood?

150
613
00:14:19,097 --> 00:14:21,205
Where's your refrigerator?  Here?

151
617
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:24,456
Even your fridge is big.

152
621
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,422
My goodness!  Do you not cook for yourself?

153
625
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,674
What do you eat to survive?

154
629
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:39,671
I will eat this later. So, please leave.

155
633
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:44,083
I'll leave after I see you eat.

156
637
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:44,478
I said I'll eat it later.

157
641
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:47,931
I'll leave after you eat.

158
645
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:48,553
Kim Sam Soon...

159
649
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:51,160
Are you joking around with me right now?

160
653
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,003
Why would I joke around?

161
657
00:14:52,003 --> 00:14:55,251
If you were me, would you not feel uncomfortable?

162
661
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:57,268
You think anyone's comfortable right now?

163
665
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:59,708
When you're hurt, I hurt as well.

164
669
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,801
So, eat while I'm in front of you.

165
673
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,673
Where are your spoons?

166
677
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:31,053
Sit down and eat this.

167
681
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,414
I'll leave right after I see you eat 10 spoonfuls.

168
685
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:36,407
I'm not going to eat.  Please leave.

169
689
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:41,182
Just eat 10 spoonfuls.  Then I'll leave.

170
693
00:15:41,182 --> 00:15:41,637
Please leave.

171
697
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,452
Then just eat 5 spoonfuls.

172
701
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:46,566
Please just leave.

173
705
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:50,177
Just consider my effort and...fine, eat a spoon.

174
709
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:01,321
What are you doing right now?

175
713
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:04,696
Are you insane?

176
717
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:06,325
Leave before I count to 3.  One...

177
721
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:07,986
If you don't eat, it only becomes your own suffering.

178
725
00:16:07,986 --> 00:16:08,958
Why won't you eat?

179
729
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:09,283
Two...

180
733
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:11,464
Are men that important? 
 Your health is more important than that!

181
738
00:16:12,658 --> 00:16:13,981
-Three. 
 -What? Anorexia?

182
743
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:16,064
You'll need to go over to Africa and experience real starvation.

183
747
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,554
I told you to leave before I counted to 3, didn't I?

184
751
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:19,940
What are you doing right now? Huh?!

185
755
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:22,732
I don't want to see you so just leave!

186
759
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,593
I don't want to see you either!

187
763
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:25,783
Hurry up and leave.

188
767
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:28,783
-Hey! I'm not leaving until I see you eat! 
 -Let go! Just leave!

189
772
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:30,579
Why is it any of your business if I eat or not?!

190
776
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:34,069
Because I feel sorry, you bitch! 
 Because I feel sorry!

191
781
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:35,363
You think I'm happy doing this?!

192
785
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:37,379
-Just leave! 
 -Hee Jin!

193
790
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:39,262
Sophie!

194
794
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:40,662
What are you doing?!

195
798
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,796
It would be best if you could start renovating things that haven't been done yet.

196
802
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:52,227
Yes, President.

197
806
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:54,613
And what is the status on the new shipment?

198
810
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:58,285
It should arrive by Saturday, President.

199
814
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,367
-How's the air-conditioner? 
 -Yes, it's been order yesterday President.

200
819
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:03,232
What about the vegetables?

201
823
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,963
They're coming by this afternoon, President.

202
827
00:17:06,928 --> 00:17:08,787
-Leader Jang. 
 -Yes President?

203
832
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:11,798
I know I'm the President, so you don't have to address me in that way.

204
836
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:12,170
Yes, President.

205
840
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,537
Has there been any difficulties lately?

206
844
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,456
No.

207
848
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:21,529
These are the list of food stocks and the sales status.

208
852
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,009
Thank you.

209
856
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:23,415
President!

210
860
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:44,462
What is it?

211
864
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:14,458
This, is 'ten'. 
In our language, it's pronounced as 'ship.'

212
869
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:16,624
-'Ship'? 
 -That's right!

213
874
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:20,222
Also some people call this 'Danpoong' (maple)

214
878
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:22,238
-But, just learn it as 10. 'Ship.' 
 -'Ship'.

215
883
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:24,478
That's right.  This is 'ship.'

216
887
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:30,256
This one, is eleven.  'Ship il.'

217
891
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:32,445
-'Ship il.' 
 -That's right. 'Ship il.'

218
896
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,082
-Ship il.' 
 -Okay?

219
901
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:42,369
This is twelve. 'Ship ee.'

220
905
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:42,784
'Ship ee.'

221
909
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,528
This is also referred to as 'rain.' 
 'Rain.'

222
914
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:53,120
But, this card is very important, so you have to keep this in mind. Because...

223
918
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,437
Under good circumstances, it's a great card. But, when you're in trouble,

224
922
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:58,785
then you have to get rid of it quickly!

225
926
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:02,373
'Rain', 'maple', 'grass', 'trees', 'moon', 'plum.' 
Okay?

226
931
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,239
'Rain', 'maple',-

227
935
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:08,329
-No, 'maple', 
 -'Maple.'  There we go.

228
940
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:08,880
-'Grass', 'trees,' 
 -'Grass', 'trees.'

229
945
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:12,155
It's very important for accurate pronunciation, okay?

230
949
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:12,576
'Moon', 'plum'.

231
953
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,823
'Rain', 'maple', 'grass', 'trees', 'moon', 'plum'.

232
957
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,160
Try it.  Follow me.

233
961
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,289
'Rain', 'maple', 'grass', 'trees', 'moon', 'plum'.

234
965
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:24,076
That's right! Okay.  That is very, very important.

235
969
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:25,351
Okay? So keep that in mind.

236
973
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:28,952
Let's see...the next thing...

237
977
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:40,704
This is the deposit.  Please double check it.

238
981
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,537
What on earth is this girl doing?

239
985
00:20:03,489 --> 00:20:07,113
That's right!  When you pair up like that, you can take it.

240
989
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,490
Your not only good-looking, but you're smart as well. 
 You're great.

241
994
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:14,756
Go on.

242
998
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:15,556
Don't take that.

243
1002
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:19,257
Take that one.

244
1006
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,000
-This one? 
 -Yeah.

245
1011
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,801
That's double the points.

246
1015
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:25,801
Really?

247
1019
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:29,168
W-Wait, wait, wait!

248
1023
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,141
Look here.  Why are you interfering?

249
1027
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:34,883
How could you be greedy and not teach him that?

250
1031
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:39,438
It's better if he learns as we play along.

251
1035
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,034
You're sick, yet you have the strength to intefere with our game.

252
1039
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,536
Woah, what are you doing? 
 You still have medicine in here.

253
1044
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,273
We'll face you together.

254
1048
00:20:55,273 --> 00:20:57,139
How can you two pair up?

255
1052
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:58,722
It's his first time playing. 
 Re-deal.

256
1057
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:00,569
Re-deal again.

257
1061
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:22,342
Hey, I appointed you as my Love messenger, 
 but why is there no progress?

258
1066
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:25,535
It's not that simple.

259
1070
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,816
Why not?

260
1074
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:29,940
-What's your secret? 
 -Secret?

261
1079
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,867
You must have a secret of doing well with Sam Shik.

262
1083
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:35,372
How can you be the only one to do well with one of them?

263
1087
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,316
Well...secret...There is one.

264
1091
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:42,899
What is it? Say it now.

265
1095
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:44,840
I'm not going to tell you.

266
1099
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:52,164
Stop!

267
1103
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:11,856
<i>calculating the point</i> 30,400 won, you should pay.

268
1107
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:16,297
Is the medical school teaching Go-Stop game?

269
1111
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:18,472
Are you not going to answer your phone?

270
1115
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,261
What?

271
1119
00:22:28,261 --> 00:22:30,859
<i> You said you'd be here for the contract signing for the store! What are you doing? </i>

272
1123
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:31,758
I don't know!  Hang up!

273
1127
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:39,657
Ok, let's try again from the beginning.

274
1131
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:47,431
You have to pay up first.

275
1135
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,137
You think I won't?

276
1139
00:22:49,137 --> 00:22:50,051
Money.

277
1143
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:55,324
I should've just given that porridge to the dog...

278
1147
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:04,295
Is that sick girl staying at home all the time and playing the gamble??

279
1151
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:06,042
So greedy and sparkly when she plays the game..

280
1155
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:09,327
I'm going to go insane...

281
1159
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:22,328
Are you having fun there?

282
1163
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:24,529
Mmhmm.

283
1167
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,231
But, what's this one called?

284
1171
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:31,332
'Goo Ssang Pi.'

285
1175
00:23:31,332 --> 00:23:32,332
'Goo Ssang Pi...'

286
1179
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:35,833
'Goo' means nine, and 'Ssang' means double.

287
1183
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:41,334
So, why does this one go back and forth from being a 10-point into something else?

288
1187
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:46,435
I don't know.  Whoever made it up came up with that idea.

289
1191
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:49,436
Why don't you go and ask?

290
1195
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:51,936
Wise answer. 
 Stupid question.

291
1200
00:24:00,837 --> 00:24:03,638
Are you hiding something from me?

292
1204
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:04,938
HIding?

293
1208
00:24:04,938 --> 00:24:06,239
What?

294
1212
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:07,640
Yeah, I think you are.

295
1216
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,340
What are you talking about?

296
1220
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:11,542
What?

297
1224
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:14,843
I think that sometimes...when you're with me

298
1228
00:24:14,843 --> 00:24:17,943
you feel something... in your heart.

299
1232
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,097
Oh...I thought it was about something else.

300
1236
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:24,698
No!

301
1240
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:25,598
Really?

302
1244
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,099
Really.

303
1248
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,400
If you say so.

304
1252
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:48,001
Then, have you noticed...that everybody else in the world seems to be moving forward.  And yet, you seem to be stuck in the past.

305
1256
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:55,202
You're like a... a frozen clock.

306
1260
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,302
You need me to change your batteries?

307
1264
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:07,203
What kind do you take?  Alkaline?  Cadnium?  Energizer?

308
1268
00:25:08,204 --> 00:25:09,784
No?

309
1272
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:13,489
Choose, Choose, Choose~

310
1276
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,290
Nice pass.

311
1280
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:20,692
Henry.

312
1284
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:22,293
Mmhmm?

313
1288
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:24,593
I want to go back to the States.

314
1292
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:33,695
I miss my parents.

315
1296
00:25:33,695 --> 00:25:34,595
What about school?

316
1300
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:42,097
You know, I can always go from there.  Maybe transfer?

317
1304
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:43,897
Are you going to leave Korea for good?

318
1308
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:49,099
Why?  You scared that I'll bother you again?

319
1312
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:54,200
No. But, as a matter of fact... I'll give you a job.

320
1316
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,101
I'll tell you what. When you finish school and you graduate, you come see me at the hospital.

321
1320
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:00,901
You can be my... my intern.

322
1324
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:02,802
Good!

323
1328
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:05,003
Yes, captain!

324
1332
00:26:07,104 --> 00:26:09,011
Yes, captain!

325
1336
00:26:09,011 --> 00:26:09,664
Thank you very much!

326
1340
00:26:19,915 --> 00:26:20,411
Is this good?

327
1344
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:22,946
Yes.

328
1348
00:26:22,946 --> 00:26:24,130
You sure are high-class.

329
1352
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:26,590
Hurry up and tell me your secret.

330
1356
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:30,825
Hurry up!

331
1360
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:48,179
What is this?  A dog or a pig?

332
1364
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,686
Are you giving me this?

333
1368
00:26:50,686 --> 00:26:51,740
You said you wanted to know the secret.

334
1372
00:26:54,832 --> 00:26:56,805
This is the secret? 
- I just need to give this as a present?

335
1377
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:57,203
Yes.

336
1381
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:02,139
Alright. 
 Giving a gift sounds good...

337
1386
00:27:03,158 --> 00:27:05,343
How old do you think I am to be carrying this around?

338
1390
00:27:06,687 --> 00:27:09,876
You just have to hold right under your arm like this, okay?

339
1394
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:14,444
Don't joke around and just tell me your secret. 
 Why buy this doll instead?

340
1399
00:27:14,444 --> 00:27:17,736
Once she bites, she won't let it go.

341
1403
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:20,070
Is this doll biting a girl?

342
1407
00:27:21,546 --> 00:27:23,930
Have this doll, and everything will fall into place.

343
1411
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,434
As you already, like drinking, that's done.

344
1415
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:28,580
And you should practice singing.

345
1419
00:27:30,757 --> 00:27:33,267
Stop kidding around and tell me what your secret is!

346
1423
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:35,969
That is the secret. You will find it useful soon.

347
1427
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,464
This has no mouth. How is...

348
1431
00:27:44,044 --> 00:27:45,379
Is this a dog or what?

349
1435
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:49,157
Hey, it's me.

350
1439
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:53,324
I have something to talk about. 
 Please come here for a moment.

351
1444
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:54,459
<i> Alright. I'll head over there now. </i>

352
1448
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:18,484
I'm going back to the States.

353
1452
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:22,246
I want to be with my parents.

354
1456
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:24,139
I lost my reason to be here.

355
1460
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:32,210
So, with this in mind... I have a favor to ask you.

356
1464
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:35,682
Tell me.

357
1468
00:29:42,705 --> 00:29:44,052
Drop me off.

358
1472
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:51,304
Drop me off in America.

359
1476
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:58,463
It's hard to go by myself.

360
1480
00:30:00,197 --> 00:30:01,070
Drop me off...

361
1484
00:30:16,704 --> 00:30:18,171
Do you...have to think about it?

362
1488
00:30:24,182 --> 00:30:26,562
Alright.  I'll drop you off.

363
1492
00:30:30,802 --> 00:30:31,831
You're not going to ask for a reason?

364
1496
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,145
It's fine.  When are you leaving?

365
1500
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,986
Car and apartment will be taken care of by my uncle.

366
1504
00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:44,062
I just need to know when you're available.

367
1508
00:30:46,526 --> 00:30:47,093
Alright then.

368
1512
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:53,320
It's our last time.

369
1516
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,110
I know.

370
1520
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:51,263
Ahjussi!

371
1524
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:54,357
Where did he go?

372
1528
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:56,978
Where did they all go?

373
1532
00:33:07,315 --> 00:33:08,786
Geez!

374
1536
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,780
Hurry up and tell me.  I have to get going.

375
1540
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,061
Just wait a while longer.  She'll be here soon.

376
1544
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:13,460
Who?

377
1548
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:21,118
Don't blame me, it's just a favor  your mom asked.

378
1552
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:23,237
A favor?  President Na's?

379
1556
00:33:23,237 --> 00:33:26,631
If you're told it's a blind date, 
 you will definitely avoid it,

380
1561
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:29,548
So, she asked me to ask you out.

381
1565
00:33:31,864 --> 00:33:33,814
I told you. You should have listened to me!

382
1569
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:37,044
Now look what's happened!  Making me feel bad...

383
1573
00:33:37,044 --> 00:33:38,930
I don't want to do this, so just take care of this yourself.

384
1577
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,458
Oppa!

385
1581
00:33:40,723 --> 00:33:43,395
I'm going to be in trouble if you leave like this!

386
1585
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:45,926
Your blind date is someone I'm close with.

387
1589
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:48,274
Oppa, there she is! > Unni!

388
1593
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:49,981
She's here.  Just sit down!

389
1597
00:33:51,152 --> 00:33:53,261
Really?  Ki Bang?

390
1601
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:57,605
He asked me to go to see a movie together. What does it mean?

391
1605
00:33:57,605 --> 00:34:00,411
It's means he likes you, you dummy.

392
1609
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:03,497
I don't like him... He's short, not good-looking...

393
1613
00:34:03,497 --> 00:34:06,452
and has a very big head.

394
1617
00:34:06,452 --> 00:34:10,069
It's true that he's not that greatest-looking man.

395
1621
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:11,299
But, In Hye...

396
1625
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,533
Once you get old, you can't turn it back.

397
1629
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:20,957
When you're younger, you need to date a whole variety of men. 
 That way, your eyes will open up.

398
1634
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:24,265
That way, you won't date any players. Understood?

399
1638
00:34:24,265 --> 00:34:26,304
I don't want to do that either...

400
1642
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:28,762
You're worrying over nothing...

401
1646
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:30,711
Then just tell him you don't like him.  Just tell him.

402
1650
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:33,254
Hang on a second.

403
1654
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,299
Hold on a moment.

404
1658
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:40,900
Hello?

405
1662
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:43,477
Why are you calling me?

406
1666
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:46,573
<i> I just had the need to tell you something interesting. </i>

407
1670
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:51,377
Even your screaming itself is very interesting to me. 
 What's the point?

408
1675
00:34:53,565 --> 00:34:55,763
Jin Hun oppa, is on a blind date.

409
1679
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:00,904
Do you know where?

410
1683
00:35:00,904 --> 00:35:02,655
 His blind date is someone I know very well...

411
1687
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:06,553
I'm quite envious of her, but I held it in.

412
1691
00:35:06,553 --> 00:35:08,336
She's very suitable, you know.

413
1695
00:35:08,336 --> 00:35:10,122
I asked if you know where it is?

414
1699
00:35:10,122 --> 00:35:12,890
This time, she's the only daughter  from a wealthy family running a Food business.

415
1703
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:17,275
She studied abroad and is working at the company.

416
1707
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:18,713
Just tell me where it is, you bitch!

417
1711
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,073
Sam Shik!

418
1715
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:41,870
What are you?

419
1719
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,855
You told me not to see other guys

420
1723
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:45,256
and not to go on blind dates, and yet you do this?

421
1727
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:48,761
This is the girl.

422
1731
00:35:53,998 --> 00:35:55,972
What are you planning?

423
1735
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:56,529
Hurry up and get up.

424
1739
00:35:57,649 --> 00:36:00,980
Just sit down.  Let's enjoy the air-conditioning for a bit.

425
1743
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,883
Are you making me mad?

426
1747
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:04,698
How can you yell in a place like this?

427
1751
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:08,719
-You're quite direct with everything. 
 -I am.

428
1756
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:16,479
Get up. Let's go. Let's go! Get up now!

429
1760
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:19,473
Today we have to go to hospital to have regular check-up for our baby.

430
1764
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:20,231
Hurry!

431
1768
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:23,576
This is the way you can try. It's surely working well.

432
1772
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:30,023
So, I guess I'll be looking forward to our co-operation together in the future.

433
1776
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,283
Yes, I hope things will work out as well.

434
1780
00:36:32,297 --> 00:36:34,315
Well, I'll be leaving now.

435
1784
00:36:34,315 --> 00:36:36,217
If I don't, I'm dead.

436
1788
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:36,725
Good-bye.

437
1792
00:36:40,475 --> 00:36:41,655
What was that?

438
1796
00:36:41,655 --> 00:36:45,511
What did you tell her about me?

439
1800
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:48,952
If you don't have good manners, 
 please have  good sense at least.

440
1805
00:36:48,952 --> 00:36:49,433
What?

441
1809
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:57,376
If that was the case, then you should have just told me. 
 This is just embarrassing for me.

442
1814
00:36:57,376 --> 00:36:59,687
You didn't give me a chance to explain.

443
1818
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,617
What kind of woman are you to be so desperate?

444
1822
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:02,210
I'm so embarassed.

445
1826
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:07,687
Even Kim Sam Soon gets embarrassed?

446
1830
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:14,784
Let's go picnic with Mi Joo tomorrow.

447
1834
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:17,139
Tomorrow?

448
1838
00:37:18,824 --> 00:37:19,881
Where?

449
1842
00:37:56,737 --> 00:37:58,027
I feel more like the kid right now.

450
1846
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,564
Just look at all the fish!

451
1850
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,775
What's that?

452
1854
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:18,469
It's a huge shark!

453
1858
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:20,711
It looks exactly like your Uncle, doesn't it?

454
1862
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:24,970
Look, he's feeding them.

455
1866
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:41,473
Please look over here.

456
1870
00:38:41,473 --> 00:38:43,176
One, two, three!

457
1874
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:53,525
She doesn't eat onions?

458
1878
00:38:55,618 --> 00:39:00,941
Mi Joo... You have no idea how good onions are good for you.

459
1882
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,296
If you don't eat onions, then you won't grow.

460
1886
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:06,007
You have to eat them, okay?

461
1890
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:11,836
And what did I say you have to call Unni from now on?

462
1894
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:15,607
Little Auntie.

463
1898
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:18,597
Say, 'Little Auntie.'

464
1902
00:39:21,412 --> 00:39:23,598
Is 'Little Auntie too hard?

465
1906
00:39:23,598 --> 00:39:26,637
Then, I'll go one above 'Unni.'

466
1910
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,131
'Older Auntie.'

467
1914
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:37,529
Say, 'Little Auntie,' 'Older Auntie'.

468
1918
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:41,415
If you don't say them, then you'll have to eat the onions.

469
1922
00:39:41,415 --> 00:39:43,252
Do you want to call me 'Little Auntie' or eat the onions?

470
1926
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:47,517
I guess this won't do.  Eat the onions.

471
1930
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,331
Just leave her alone.  She's going to cry.

472
1934
00:39:51,331 --> 00:39:53,341
Why? She has to eat them. 
 She didn't call me Little Auntie.

473
1939
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,401
Mi Joo, eat your sandwich.

474
1943
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:01,499
Feed me too.

475
1947
00:40:23,077 --> 00:40:25,741
He disappeared.  Where's Momo?

476
1951
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,686
Momo could get the meaning of the word for the first time.

477
1955
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,554
However I...

478
1959
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:48,051
<i> Momo? </i>

479
1963
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:54,747
<i> Momo? </i>

480
1967
00:41:57,959 --> 00:42:03,265
<i> It's me. The keeper of time. </i>

481
1971
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:07,424
<i> The professor of minutes and seconds. </i>

482
1975
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,940
<i> It's must have been tiring for you today, wasn't it? </i>

483
1979
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,956
<i> Should I give you some ice-cream? </i>

484
1983
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:18,275
<i> Ah! 
 Stop, stop! </i>

485
1988
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,763
<i> Momo...</i>

486
1992
00:42:21,763 --> 00:42:26,728
<i>This is a very important favor I'm going to ask you...
 So listen very closely.</i>

487
1997
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:32,438
<i> Can you scratch my back?  My back is so itchy! </i>

488
2001
00:42:34,215 --> 00:42:38,007
<i> A little higher!  More to the left! </i>

489
2005
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:41,049
<i> Yes! Right there!  So refreshing! </i>

490
2009
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,076
<i> You can stop now. </i>

491
2013
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,100
<i> Thank you, Momo. </i>

492
2017
00:42:48,368 --> 00:42:51,220
<i> Casseopia, send Momo back home. </i>

493
2021
00:42:52,393 --> 00:42:54,911
<i> Goodbye Momo!  Goodbye! </i>

494
2025
00:43:18,656 --> 00:43:21,278
What? A week? Where are you going?

495
2029
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:24,133
I have to go to the States for a bit.

496
2033
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,356
The States?

497
2037
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:28,833
Why?

498
2041
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:32,795
What is it?  What is it that you have to go all the way to America?

499
2045
00:43:37,257 --> 00:43:38,635
To drop off Hee Jin.

500
2049
00:43:42,374 --> 00:43:47,309
Hee Jin wants to go back to the States. Her parents are there...

501
2053
00:43:48,722 --> 00:43:52,147
I'm going to drop her off and she her settle down...

502
2057
00:43:52,147 --> 00:43:53,752
and I think it's going to take about a week.

503
2061
00:44:04,281 --> 00:44:04,864
What about Henry?

504
2065
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:09,207
Can't she just go with Henry?

505
2069
00:44:09,207 --> 00:44:10,782
Henry's going too.

506
2073
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:12,102
Then why do you have to go all the way over there?

507
2077
00:44:13,427 --> 00:44:15,819
Because...I'm doing this because we're friends.

508
2081
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,539
Friends?

509
2085
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:21,500
Since when were you guys ever friends?

510
2089
00:44:23,525 --> 00:44:24,229
You're going to wake her up.

511
2093
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:31,960
I don't like it.

512
2097
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,988
I can't send you.  Don't go.

513
2101
00:44:38,905 --> 00:44:39,952
Sam Soon...

514
2105
00:44:39,952 --> 00:44:44,113
Hee Jin sure is a weird person.  Why does she want this? 
What's her reason?

515
2110
00:44:47,664 --> 00:44:49,507
It's our last time.

516
2114
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:53,301
Are you guys filming a movie?

517
2118
00:44:53,301 --> 00:44:54,721
I just want to do it.

518
2122
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:55,140
Why?

519
2126
00:44:56,462 --> 00:44:58,963
Because...You can't forget your first love?

520
2130
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,761
Can't you let it go?  It's that hard?

521
2134
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:03,201
Don't twist it.

522
2138
00:45:05,211 --> 00:45:06,598
Then what kind of sympathy is this?

523
2142
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,537
You really are too kind.

524
2146
00:45:10,537 --> 00:45:12,531
Full of compassion, right?

525
2150
00:45:12,531 --> 00:45:14,080
Don't twist it, I said.

526
2154
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,267
Why just stop there?

527
2158
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:16,746
Why not just stay there?

528
2162
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:18,171
That's not what we're discussing right now!

529
2166
00:45:18,171 --> 00:45:19,415
I held it in when I could.

530
2170
00:45:20,595 --> 00:45:22,731
At what point do I need to hold everything in?

531
2174
00:45:22,731 --> 00:45:24,410
I'm disappointed.

532
2178
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,569
I thought you were going to understand.

533
2182
00:45:28,964 --> 00:45:31,202
At what point do I need to keep understanding?

534
2186
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:32,209
I'm really disappointed too!

535
2190
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:35,861
If you go, then end it with me.

536
2194
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:37,249
I told you not to say that.

537
2198
00:45:37,249 --> 00:45:38,714
Who was the one who brought this up?!

538
2202
00:45:38,714 --> 00:45:40,352
You can't even wait for a week?!

539
2206
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:40,795
No, I can't.

540
2210
00:45:42,381 --> 00:45:45,017
A person's heart can change at any time...

541
2214
00:45:45,017 --> 00:45:47,583
If that were true, then it wouldn't have been difficult for us in the first place.

542
2218
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:49,333
You think I'm playing around with you right now?!

543
2222
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,324
That's why I'm telling you not to go!

544
2226
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:53,617
I don't like it!

545
2230
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,397
I told you that I don't like it,  and yet you go anyways?!

546
2234
00:46:03,115 --> 00:46:04,447
Fine.

547
2238
00:46:04,447 --> 00:46:08,207
Rather than us dealing with it... I'll just go and ask her.

548
2242
00:46:10,407 --> 00:46:11,880
Are you insane?  Where are you going?

549
2246
00:46:12,887 --> 00:46:14,170
Yeah, I'm insane.

550
2250
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,267
Let go.  Let go, so I can ask her!

551
2254
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:18,112
Just stop this!

552
2258
00:46:29,273 --> 00:46:31,224
I hate you Uncle!

553
2262
00:46:36,216 --> 00:46:38,369
I hate you Uncle!

554
2266
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:39,781
Stop yelling!

555
2270
00:46:41,225 --> 00:46:43,454
Stop yelling!

556
2274
00:47:01,414 --> 00:47:03,042
Stop fighting!

557
2278
00:47:04,177 --> 00:47:05,865
Stop fighting!

558
2282
00:47:17,321 --> 00:47:18,410
We'll stop fighting.

559
2286
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:21,843
We'll stop fighting, so stop crying.

560
2290
00:47:23,742 --> 00:47:24,410
Don't cry.

561
2294
00:47:28,983 --> 00:47:29,660
We won't argue anymore.

562
2298
00:47:32,407 --> 00:47:33,920
We won't fighting anymore... So don't cry, Mi Joo.

563
2302
00:47:40,268 --> 00:47:41,672
Uncle did wrong.

564
2306
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:50,819
I understand.  I won't go.

565
2310
00:48:53,406 --> 00:48:55,860
If you hate the idea so much,  I won't go.

566
2314
00:48:58,232 --> 00:48:59,093
Satisfied?

567
2318
00:49:00,323 --> 00:49:02,144
If I didn't refuse, you would've gone.

568
2322
00:49:04,752 --> 00:49:07,792
Thinking about it makes me upset.

569
2326
00:49:09,206 --> 00:49:10,355
Sam Soon-

570
2330
00:49:10,355 --> 00:49:14,207
I hate it that it's like the three of us are living together.

571
2334
00:49:17,846 --> 00:49:19,397
I'm not in the mood right now.

572
2338
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:35,263
You're not going to turn around?

573
2342
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,867
Please be careful.

574
2346
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,827
You can put that over there.

575
2350
00:49:54,999 --> 00:49:56,228
Just a little more further back.

576
2354
00:50:11,745 --> 00:50:15,843
You can just place that there.  That can go over there.

577
2358
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:26,159
Hey, Sam Soon. Come over here. Come and see this.

578
2362
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:26,667
What is it?

579
2366
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:46,175
Unni...

580
2370
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:51,502
Why are you so clever, unni?

581
2374
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:54,045
You realize this now?

582
2378
00:50:54,045 --> 00:50:54,823
I studied well.

583
2382
00:50:56,329 --> 00:50:58,370
Then how did I end up like this?

584
2386
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:58,761
You?

585
2390
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:01,391
Because you're Sam Soon.

586
2394
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,582
Fine.

587
2398
00:51:08,582 --> 00:51:10,679
Because I'm Sam Soon... I'm going to stop for today.

588
2402
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:11,751
Hey!  Let's finish this first!

589
2406
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:14,603
You!

590
2410
00:51:14,603 --> 00:51:15,540
Sam Soon is busy right now.

591
2414
00:51:16,548 --> 00:51:18,851
I'm going to change our shop's name to YiYoung then!

592
2418
00:51:36,715 --> 00:51:37,991
She's testing me right now, isn't she?

593
2422
00:51:49,532 --> 00:51:51,236
Why aren't you calling me?

594
2426
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,531
<i> Let's have dinner together. </i>

595
2430
00:52:07,465 --> 00:52:09,886
<i> Call me. </i>

596
2434
00:52:13,803 --> 00:52:15,351
<i> -Call me 
-My Hun </i>

597
2439
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:20,688
Who are you to order me around?

598
2443
00:52:58,992 --> 00:53:01,807
<i> My Hun. </i>

599
2447
00:53:23,474 --> 00:53:25,195
How could she refuse my call...

600
2451
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:44,842
It's me.

601
2455
00:53:46,455 --> 00:53:47,581
I have something to ask you.

602
2459
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:02,295
You're going back?

603
2463
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:04,634
Yes.

604
2467
00:54:06,905 --> 00:54:08,821
Did you ask Jin Hun to send you off?

605
2471
00:54:10,228 --> 00:54:11,278
Yes.

606
2475
00:54:11,278 --> 00:54:11,674
Why?

607
2479
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,738
Do I... have to tell you that?

608
2483
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:17,775
Because he's my man.

609
2487
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:21,853
You're quite direct.

610
2491
00:54:21,853 --> 00:54:22,379
What's your reason?

611
2495
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,398
I don't want to tell you.

612
2499
00:54:30,692 --> 00:54:33,632
If it's hard for you, you have Henry.

613
2503
00:54:33,632 --> 00:54:35,380
Henry's returning with me as well.

614
2507
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,710
Then why do you need to take Jin Hun as well?

615
2511
00:54:38,477 --> 00:54:41,725
If Jin Hun doesn't want to go, then I won't push the idea further.

616
2515
00:54:42,785 --> 00:54:44,956
It was only a favor.

617
2519
00:54:44,956 --> 00:54:46,221
Are you still not over him?

618
2523
00:54:47,919 --> 00:54:49,630
Do you think this will bring Jin Hun back to you?

619
2527
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,362
You think memories don't have strength?

620
2531
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:56,677
Yes, you're right.

621
2535
00:54:58,565 --> 00:55:00,638
But, they'll always be there.

622
2539
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,876
Memories... can't be erased.

623
2543
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:13,408
I have no interest in taking Jin Hun away from you.

624
2547
00:55:13,408 --> 00:55:18,130
I just want to bury those memories with Jin Hun away.

625
2551
00:55:19,945 --> 00:55:21,489
There's no need for you beat around the bush, so just say it.

626
2555
00:55:23,602 --> 00:55:25,202
It's a departing trip.

627
2559
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:29,901
That's quite a departing journey.

628
2563
00:55:31,224 --> 00:55:32,428
Taking him so far away.

629
2567
00:55:37,366 --> 00:55:39,875
I don't have anywhere else to put the other stuff you've given me, so I'm giving this to you first.

630
2571
00:55:45,745 --> 00:55:46,606
Did you throw it away?

631
2575
00:55:48,315 --> 00:55:49,130
I ate it.

632
2579
00:55:50,629 --> 00:55:52,294
You really didn't throw it out, and you ate it?

633
2583
00:55:52,294 --> 00:55:52,954
I ate it all.

634
2587
00:55:57,217 --> 00:55:57,906
It was delicious, wasn't it?

635
2591
00:56:01,146 --> 00:56:02,049
Yes.

636
2595
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,527
That's a relief considering who made this for you.

637
2599
00:56:05,474 --> 00:56:07,792
That's why I can't send Jin Hun off.

638
2603
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:08,806
No, I'm not sending him.

639
2607
00:56:13,555 --> 00:56:15,718
I'm so embarassed carrying this around, so just take it.

640
2611
00:56:15,718 --> 00:56:16,888
What is this?

641
2615
00:56:16,888 --> 00:56:18,281
What do you think?  It's a doll.

642
2619
00:56:18,281 --> 00:56:19,279
You want me to have this?

643
2623
00:56:19,279 --> 00:56:20,532
You want me to have this?

644
2627
00:56:20,532 --> 00:56:22,184
You think I'll play with this at home?

645
2631
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,651
I've passed that age also.

646
2635
00:56:29,629 --> 00:56:30,134
Let's get married.

647
2639
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:35,448
I don't like eating by myself. 
 Let's get married.

648
2644
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:39,832
Listen here Mr. Kwon Hae Yo. 
 Don't so be quick about everything.

649
2649
00:56:39,832 --> 00:56:41,247
We're not even dating so what's this marriage nonsense...

650
2653
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,126
How could...

651
2657
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:50,447
We've eaten out together, drank together, went to movies together... All of those things weren't qualified to be dates?

652
2661
00:56:50,447 --> 00:56:52,426
If you want to get married, ask another girl.

653
2665
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:54,842
No, I'm going to marry you.

654
2669
00:56:54,842 --> 00:56:57,470
I've already been married before. 
 You think I want to do it again?

655
2674
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:00,140
You've done it before, so wouldn't the second one turn out better?  Let's do it.

656
2678
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:00,803
No.

657
2682
00:57:00,803 --> 00:57:03,342
I have no interest in marrying again.

658
2686
00:57:03,342 --> 00:57:04,719
Why not?

659
2690
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:06,255
Why do you not want to?

660
2694
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:07,433
Why won't you?

661
2698
00:57:07,433 --> 00:57:08,618
I only got married before because I was curious.

662
2702
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,073
Why would you get married because you were curious?

663
2706
00:57:12,073 --> 00:57:13,095
My mouth hurts, so stop talking.

664
2710
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,551
Fine.

665
2714
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:17,338
Let's change the idea then.

666
2718
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,944
Let's live together.

667
2722
00:57:19,944 --> 00:57:20,420
I don't want to.

668
2726
00:57:21,642 --> 00:57:22,386
Why not?!

669
2730
00:57:24,148 --> 00:57:28,258
I would have to cook, clean, and do everything in the house.

670
2734
00:57:29,918 --> 00:57:31,467
Why do you live like this?

671
2738
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:34,073
My goodness!

672
2742
00:57:34,073 --> 00:57:34,651
My goodness...

673
2746
00:57:41,399 --> 00:57:43,241
What are you doing? 
 What are you doing?!

674
2751
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:44,224
You said you would do something!

675
2755
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:46,113
Stupid pig...

676
2759
00:57:49,009 --> 00:57:52,193
How could you take your anger out on this pig?

677
2763
00:57:52,193 --> 00:57:52,819
Do you want to eat some too?

678
2767
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,459
Where did you go?

679
2771
00:58:09,758 --> 00:58:11,087
You refuse my calls?

680
2775
00:58:14,588 --> 00:58:16,488
You better not turn off your phone next time.

681
2779
00:58:16,488 --> 00:58:19,067
And when you're going somewhere, tell me...

682
2783
00:58:19,067 --> 00:58:20,416
and update me every hour.

683
2787
00:58:23,205 --> 00:58:24,932
Where did you come back from?

684
2791
00:58:24,932 --> 00:58:26,726
What were you doing to turn off your phone?

685
2795
00:58:27,876 --> 00:58:29,862
I went to go meet with Hee Jin.

686
2799
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:35,799
She already packed all of her stuff.

687
2803
00:58:35,799 --> 00:58:36,668
So?

688
2807
00:58:36,668 --> 00:58:37,867
Are you going to go?

689
2811
00:58:37,867 --> 00:58:38,741
I told you that I wasn't.

690
2815
00:58:40,063 --> 00:58:41,464
That's the truth, right?

691
2819
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:42,111
You don't trust me?

692
2823
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:45,341
Alright, don't go.

693
2827
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:52,883
If you don't go...

694
2831
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:55,391
Do you want to go?

695
2835
00:59:00,347 --> 00:59:02,414
If I told you to go, would you go?

696
2839
00:59:08,977 --> 00:59:09,711
Yeah.

697
2843
00:59:13,775 --> 00:59:15,310
I...want to do this for her.

698
2847
00:59:20,556 --> 00:59:21,585
Only a week?

699
2851
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:30,473
You really only need a week?

700
2855
00:59:38,692 --> 00:59:39,460
Go.

701
2859
00:59:44,687 --> 00:59:49,214
Go now before I change my mind.

702
2863
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,857
What is wrong with you?

703
2867
00:59:57,857 --> 01:00:00,506
Neighbours can see us! 
 Let go!

704
2872
01:00:00,506 --> 01:00:01,178
Hold on just for a second.

705
2876
01:00:02,611 --> 01:00:04,441
I wanted to hug you all day.

706
2880
01:00:08,189 --> 01:00:08,726
Thank you.

707
2884
01:00:11,073 --> 01:00:12,128
You are Kim Sam Soon.

708
2888
01:00:13,723 --> 01:00:15,105
I knew you would understand.

709
2892
01:00:17,766 --> 01:00:21,155
Don't flatter yourself. You think I'm doing this because of you?

710
2896
01:00:22,977 --> 01:00:24,606
It's for my own comfort.

711
2900
01:00:26,196 --> 01:00:26,979
That's why...

712
2904
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:31,011
You should change your name if you want to.

713
2908
01:00:33,555 --> 01:00:34,086
What?

714
2912
01:00:35,395 --> 01:00:37,863
If you want to do it, then do it.

715
2916
01:00:37,863 --> 01:00:38,849
Although I like Sam Soon,

716
2920
01:00:39,882 --> 01:00:43,230
it's not like I can do anything about it if you don't like it. Do it.

717
2924
01:00:55,971 --> 01:01:01,283
It would be great if you were a little doll and I could just put you right in my pocket.

718
2928
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:05,591
I...

719
2932
01:01:07,415 --> 01:01:13,680
wish you were an apron, so I can have you around my waist all day.

720
2936
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,752
That way you wouldn't go anywhere.

721
2940
01:01:24,316 --> 01:01:30,839
Hee Jin...didn't throw away the porridge I made and ate it all.

722
2944
01:01:32,695 --> 01:01:33,248
Is that so?

723
2948
01:01:36,064 --> 01:01:40,491
So... don't worry.

724
2952
01:01:43,436 --> 01:01:44,111
Thank you.

725
2956
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:25,847
I guess this is real.

726
2960
01:02:27,215 --> 01:02:29,141
He really got rid of them.

727
2964
01:02:51,867 --> 01:02:53,149
Hello.

728
2968
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:55,669
This is an application for a request in name change. 
 I've come to register.

729
2973
01:02:55,669 --> 01:02:57,280
<i> Application for name change </i>

730
2977
01:03:05,878 --> 01:03:10,327
<i>He left yesterday. My sister told me I was crazy for letting him leave yesterday. </i>

731
2981
01:03:11,524 --> 01:03:13,414
<i> She said that there wasn't anyone in this world who is as foolish as I am. </i>

732
2985
01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:17,759
<i> I think the same way. </i>

733
2989
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:22,958
<i> But...love can turn us into fools. </i>

734
2993
01:03:24,722 --> 01:03:26,735
<i> If someone liked my name as Sam Soon...</i>

735
2997
01:03:27,926 --> 01:03:31,705
<i> Then that person has become a fool as well. </i>

736
3001
01:03:35,305 --> 01:03:38,877
<i> I...am Kim Hee Jin! </i>

737
3005
01:03:39,968 --> 01:03:42,548
<i> Not Kim Sam Soon! </i>

738
3009
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:46,298
<i> But Kim Hee Jin! </i>

739
3013
01:03:46,298 --> 01:03:46,991
<i> Under who's decision? </i>

740
3017
01:03:48,906 --> 01:03:50,735
<i> Who said you're Kim Hee Jin? </i>

741
3021
01:03:50,735 --> 01:03:52,225
<i> I told you that I liked Sam Soon! </i>

742
3025
01:04:01,548 --> 01:04:02,228
Here.

743
3029
01:04:07,854 --> 01:04:12,935
So...starting from now... I'll be Kim Hee Jin?

744
3033
01:04:12,935 --> 01:04:13,409
Yes.

745
3037
01:04:17,778 --> 01:04:19,927
Is today the last day?

746
3041
01:04:19,927 --> 01:04:22,615
Yes, today's the last day.

747
3045
01:04:25,242 --> 01:04:26,807
<i>I would've have come if you were Kim Hee Jin. </i>

748
3049
01:04:28,162 --> 01:04:32,944
<i>The only Kim Sam Soon in this world would climb this mountain because of what I said.</i>

749
3053
01:04:32,944 --> 01:04:34,358
<i> The least I can do is show my sincerity. </i>

750
3057
01:04:37,327 --> 01:04:38,653
Excuse me.

751
3061
01:04:38,653 --> 01:04:41,331
Do you mind if I can just get that application back?

752
3065
01:04:41,331 --> 01:04:41,736
Of course.

753
3069
01:04:43,752 --> 01:04:45,845
I'm just going to look it over.

754
3073
01:04:56,779 --> 01:04:58,794
<i> Kim Sam Soon. </i>

755
3077
01:05:15,543 --> 01:05:19,117
<i> Love...can really make you a fool. </i>

756
3081
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:30,601
<i> A week has passed. </i>

757
3085
01:05:30,601 --> 01:05:31,753
<i> It felt like a year. </i>

758
3089
01:05:33,494 --> 01:05:37,220
<i> And...he has yet to return. </i>
