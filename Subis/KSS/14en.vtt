<i> Episode 14 
 The Basis of A Loving Relationship</i>

2
8
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:15,380
I too... have changed. 
 Let's stop.

3
13
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,200
Do you love her?

4
17
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:21,121
I keep thinking about her.

5
21
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,842
Do you love her?

6
25
00:00:22,842 --> 00:00:23,622
I miss her.

7
29
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,800
I asked if you love her?!

8
33
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:32,817
When I'm with her...
 I'm happy.
♫  <i>because I haven't forgotten  </i>♫

9
39
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:39,000
You're going to forget about her with time...
♫  <i>because I haven't forgotten  </i>♫

10
44
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,150
Like how we are now.

48
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,450
♫  <i> I've already erased the painful tears </i> ♫

12
52
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,000
Yet, you want to go?
 ♫  <i> I've already erased the painful tears </i> ♫

13
57
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:49,539
People...

00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,250
♫  <i> which stained my sickly face. </i>

15
65

♫ <i>Dear, my beautiful love,  </i>♫

16
69
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,300

♫ <i> please hold my hand </i>♫

18
78
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,301
How could you do this to me?
 ♫ <i> please hold my hand </i>♫

19
83
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:13,401
Who are you?!  Who are you?! 
 Who are you to do this to me?!
♫ <i> Come back to me, like a lovely song </i> ♫

20
89
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:22,780

22
99

♫The cloudy moonlight bathes the mirror ♫

23
104
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:37,027

24
108
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,538
<i> Because I said you should wait...</i>

25
112
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,077
♫  <i> Time passing in a deep sleep has aged my face. </i> ♫

26
116
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:47,200

31
137
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:20,600
I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry.

32
143
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,960
♫  <i> I'll smile. </i>♫

33
147
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,700
<i>Hello? 
 Are you going to answer!?</i>

34
152
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:49,322
Say what you want to say.

35
156
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,100
<i> Come home this instant. 
 Come here in 30 minutes. </i>

36
161
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,500
What do you think you're doing?!

37
165
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,900
Your brother already turned out like this...

38
169
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,335
I was really worried you'd step into the wrong way.

39
173
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:16,146
Although he acts immature, 
he's doing it on purpose.

40
178
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:18,899
He's not stupid, so he'd be alright soon enough.

41
182
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:22,167
But, what? 
 A love contract?

42
187
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,749
It's not enough for you to trick your own mother,

43
191
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:26,820
but you just waste money like it's nothing?!

44
195
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,800
Is that what people do?!

45
199
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:06,587
<i> Sam Soon </i>

46
203
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,700
<i>The number you have dialed is not in service. </i>

47
207
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,020
Why aren't you answering your phone?

48
211
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:34,120
We're only going to be watching a movie. 
 Why do you have to be so specific?

49
216
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,258
Do you even have someone who asks you to watch a movie together?

50
220
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:39,234
Show me if you have one.

51
224
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:42,742
Why haven't you been answering your phone? I don't know if we're going to go on a date or not now.

52
228
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,700
Sam Shik, what are you doing here?

53
232
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:48,000
Sam Soon is there?

54
236
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
I'll talk about it later.

55
240
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:54,605
Unni! What brings you here?

56
244
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,200
I'll talk about it later.

57
248
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:59,412
Sam Soon, are you planning on working here again?

58
252
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,900
I'll tell you later.

59
256
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:07,154
Ugh, this guy is impossible..

60
260
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,100
Hey, why don't you answer your phone? Making me worried about you- Where is he?

61
264
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,100
Are you looking for the President?

62
268
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,799
Did he not come in today?

63
272
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:21,545
He wasn't here yesterday, so I don't know if he's coming in today.

64
276
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:23,125
Why didn't he come to work?

65
280
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,900
I guess... he's sick.

66
284
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,854
Did you lose weight?

67
288
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:31,490
Mind your own business. 
 I only straightened my hair.

68
293
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,260
I wonder where he is...

69
297
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,960
Goodness!

70
301
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:49,685
You punk!

71
305
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:52,556
Hey! Are you not going to stay where you are?! 
 Hey you punk!

72
310
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,092
You think I can forgive you?!

73
314
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:57,515
- I'm sorry! 
 - You bastard!

74
319
00:05:57,515 --> 00:05:59,661
You punk! How much did you get paid?

75
323
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:00,999
Get out of the way!

76
327
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:05,478
You SOB! How much did you get paid?

77
331
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,747
You think you could have gotten away with it?!

78
335
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:09,034
You punk!

79
339
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:12,249
How could you do that to me?!

80
343
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,100
Quickly open up you little S***T!

81
347
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,400
Are you not going to open the door?! 
 Open the door!

82
352
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,980
Open the door. 
 You better open it while I'm being nice.

83
357
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,642
Or else I'm going to pull all of your hair out!

84
361
00:06:28,436 --> 00:06:32,349
She said she would give me a job in the kitchen at  a nice hotel.

85
365
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:36,812
You have no idea what kind of opportunity that was for me.

86
369
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:39,610
I couldn't refuse!

87
373
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,206
I'm also a victim!

88
377
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:52,234
Noona? Noona!

89
381
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:58,517
Was it that important to you to become the hotel's head chef?

90
385
00:06:58,517 --> 00:06:59,593
Yes.

91
389
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:03,199
What's so great about being the hotel's head chef? 
 Huh?

92
394
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,618
I would look cool.

93
398
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:07,097
You look so modest, but you care so much about your looks.

94
402
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:11,057
Hey, just hurry up and open the door. 
 I need to use the washroom.

95
407
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,069
Hurry.

96
411
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,600
You're not going to hit me, right?

97
415
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,833
Why would I hit you? 
 I would've broken this door by now if I wanted to hit you. Open quickly.

98
420
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,256
That's a promise.

99
424
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:22,708
If I hit you, I'd be your granddaughter. Open.

100
428
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,794
Right now!

101
432
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,609
You punk!

102
436
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:37,311
-Hey! 
 How could you do that to me?! You punk!

103
441
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,236
You disloyal punk!

104
445
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:43,636
You coward!

105
449
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,200
How much money did you get?! 
 How much of it did you consume?

106
454
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,958
Are you that in love with money? 
 Are you?!

107
459
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,467
Bastard!

108
463
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:34,372
I brought porridge. 
 It's sesame porridge...

109
468
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,060
Who's at the door?

110
472
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,280
What's wrong with your face?

111
476
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:05,942
Your face is so gaunt. 
 Did you catch a cold?

112
481
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:09,394
Do you need to go to the hospital?

113
485
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,800
Hello.

114
489
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:24,474
Please get me your best porridge.

115
493
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:48,140
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like eating.

116
497
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,470
Sorry.

117
501
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:57,676
Do you want me to tell you a story?

118
505
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:05,778
Once when I was little, there was a time when I was really sick, and I couldn't eat anything.

119
509
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:12,979
And then one day, I saw my mom, 
 boiling this huge pot of water... putting rice into it.

120
514
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:16,980
And later I found out that it was jook (porridge).

121
518
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,781
And to this day, my mom says 
 that whenever you're sick, you should eat jook.

122
523
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:28,181
So no matter how hard it is, you should never skip
 meals because it's not good for your stomach.

123
528
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,300
Okay.

124
532
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Happy?

125
536
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,800
Are you okay?

126
540
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,300
Are you...
Are you going to throw up?

127
545
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,960
I'm fine...

128
549
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:04,187
No, it's just... my stomach's upset. 
 I haven't been eating all day.

129
554
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:10,089
You need to tell me when you don't feel well.

130
558
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:12,490
You shouldn't ignore it. You know I'm your doctor.

131
562
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,200
Yes, sir.

132
566
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:18,000
I got it.

133
570
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,700
Understood?

134
574
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:02,051
Wake up. 
 Have some porridge.

135
579
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:06,884
You said you haven't eaten for 2 days.

136
583
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's at least have a couple of spoonfuls, okay?

137
587
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:35,762
Was it that hard?

138
591
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:45,198
That just makes me feel really bad.

139
595
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:52,134
Never mind. 
 Just eat.

140
600
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm sorry. 
I'll keep my mouth shut, so just eat it all.

141
605
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:17,694
You should have some more.

142
609
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,567
Stop sucking it in.

143
613
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:32,094
Tomorrow's our day off. 
 What should we do?

144
618
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,864
Can you go outside?

145
622
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:37,271
It would be good if we stayed here, too.

146
626
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:40,447
No, we're not doing anything in here until I lose weight.

147
630
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:42,997
How much weight have you lost?

148
634
00:13:43,663 --> 00:13:46,585
- 600g. 
 - That's like a piece of pork.

149
639
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:49,460
Now you have the energy to talk?

150
643
00:13:49,515 --> 00:13:51,417
How do I wait 2 months?

151
647
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:56,615
Don't you worry. 
 There's still plenty to do.

152
652
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:04,920
When this Sam Soon got a boyfriend, this is the top 7 things I want to do.

153
656
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,100
<i> Number 7: Walk around while holding hands.</i>

154
660
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:16,420
I kind of wanted to change wearing this black one all the time..

155
664
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,930
Just buy something else.

156
668
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,900
But..the heart...

157
672
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,700
Look at this.

158
676
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,000
When I lose all my weight, this would just look great on me.

159
680
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,900
How do I look?

160
684
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,800
Do you need help?

161
688
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,108
Suck in.

162
692
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,126
I did.

163
696
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
You did?

164
700
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,400
Wait, I can't breathe.

165
704
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,797
This outfit is poorly made.

166
708
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:52,082
Why couldn't they have used more fabrics... how stingy.

167
712
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:54,235
How can I buy anything if nothing fits me!

168
716
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:57,533
Let's eat some rabokki (dukkbokki with ramyun)

169
720
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:01,389
I'm going to die of hunger.

170
724
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:17,546
You're eating so well.

171
728
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:22,710
<i>Number 6: Having a picture with my boyfriend for my cellphone.</i>

172
732
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:27,666
Let's take a picture here.

173
736
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,354
There's people here watching.

174
740
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:31,887
-Why would it matter if people are here? 
-You said you would take one with me.

175
745
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:34,481
Why take one here? 
Let's take one later.

176
750
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:37,375
Hurry! You said we were going to take one, so what's the matter?

177
754
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,141
Fine, I'm not going to take one.

178
758
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,500
Just take one! 
 Just take one right now!

179
763
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:46,500
Fine! Okay! I'll take one!

180
767
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
- You will? 
 - Alright!

181
772
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:58,100
-One, two...
-Do you have to do this.

182
777
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,100
One, two, three!

183
781

<i>Sam Soon ❤︎ Sam Shik</i>

184
785
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:14,750
<i>Number 5: Dining and drinking beer together while on a train to visit Busan.</i>

185
789
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:19,233
KTX (a very speedy train in Korea) is express.
Jagalchi (a type of fish in Korea) and sea eel are a must.

186
794
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,800
What did you say?!

187
798
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:41,748
Say, "I love you, Kim Hee Jin" to a group of people in public.

188
802
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:44,250
A-Are you crazy?

189
806
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,164
I have to do this childish act?

190
810
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:50,650
You think this is childish compared to other childish acts you've done?

191
814
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:55,102
And it's unfair that we don't do what most people do.

192
818
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:58,335
Who said most people do it? 
Only some madmen do those things..

193
823
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Either way, I want to do it. 
 Before I get older.

194
828
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,760
It's too childish. Do it by yourself. 
 I'm not doing it.

195
833
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,522
Hey! That's 4th on my list!

196
837
00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:13,085
Since we're taking the train, confess on the train.

197
841
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:16,508
No way. I'd probably puke all the fish out.

198
845
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,245
Since I bought this, don't eat it.

199
849
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:22,279
I bought the train tickets.

200
853
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,578
Earlier, fI bought the boiled eggs and cola.

201
857
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:26,298
You never paid back the interest.

202
861
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:27,034
What?

203
865
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,637
Why are you pretending like you don't know anything?

204
869
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:30,997
You really are a cheap panty...

205
873
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:33,902
Were you actually going to get that from me?

206
877
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:36,100
Who was the one who started it?

207
881
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,200
You should be glad that I don't ask for the interest and the principal.

208
885
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:40,972
- Then take it from the 100 million won. 
 - What?

209
890
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:43,810
You said you were going to pay me 100 million won. 
 Just take it from there.

210
895
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,522
- You think 100 million is a joke? 
 - You said you were going to give 100 million.

211
900
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,300
Were you not going to give me the money?

212
904
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,300
What will men do in order to win a girl's heart...?

213
908
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:55,109
You're harassing your Noona again, aren't you?

214
912
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,040
You always take advantage of your age!

215
916
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,631
And you're not a Noona to me anymore, okay?

216
920
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,900
You're talking nonsense again.

217
924
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,173
It's so amazing how you never get tired.

218
928
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,173
Are you going to do it or not?

219
932
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,262
Do it now.

220
936
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,800
No.

221
940
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,100
What are you going to do if I do it?

222
944
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,852
Does there always have to be a reward?

223
948
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,741
Since when is anything free?

224
952
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,785
Then shorten the two months to one month.

225
956
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:24,669
- That's the only thing that's going on in your mind, isn't it?
 -Yeah.

226
961
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Fine, one month.

227
965
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,600
People of this train!

228
969
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:45,877
My girlfriend's name is not Yi Soon or Lee Soon, but Sam Soon.

229
973
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Kim Sam Soon.

230
977
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,841
But she wants to change her name.

231
981
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:54,507
Do you guys not like her name?

232
985
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
It's fine!

233
989
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,500
Thank you! Sam Soon and I will live well together.

234
993
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:10,599
See? 
 Everybody loves your name.

235
998
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,800
Do you really think I'd give up just like that?

236
1002
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,300
We'll just see who wins.

237

<i> Number 3: Getting romantic while watching a horror film. </i>

238
1010
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:36,742
Let's just be a little intimate. 
 The air conditioning is freezing here anyway.

239
1015
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,531
We came to watch a movie, not for a date.

240
1019
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:42,668
How childish...

241
1023
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:45,266
I need to take you outside for a drink or something.

242
1027
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,600
Those kids are lucky. 
 The scenery is nice.

243
1032
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:56,826
What are they doing?

244
1036
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,051
What do you mean? 
 It's a good thing.

245
1041
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,200
I should be doing that too..

246
1045
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,800
Will you stop giving me that stare?

247
1049
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,000
Hey. 
 Kim Sam Soon?

248
1054
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:33,035
Sam Soon. Sam Soon.

249
1058
00:20:35,021 --> 00:20:37,559
Kim Sam So... 
 Sam Shik, you!

250
1063
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,250
You!

251
1067
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,900
What?

252
1071
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,300
Hey. What happened? 
 Are you two dating?

253
1076
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,417
Clean up. 
 Are you guys dating?

254
1081
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:56,473
Yeah.

255
1085
00:20:56,473 --> 00:21:02,409
They say late learners enjoy it all night long.
 I can't believe this.

256
1090
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:06,585
Then what about you, Unni? 
 What are you doing here with Manager Lee?

257
1095
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,517
Are you two dating? Huh?

258
1099
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:12,631
Dating? 
 We're just here to watch a movie.

259
1104
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:16,671
Look at you...
 I got bored, so I came out with him.

260
1109
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:20,957
Then Manager Lee came out here with you because he was bored. Did you know that?

261
1113
00:21:20,957 --> 00:21:23,119
How can I be an easy girl to him for such a guy?

262
1117
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,044
It's not even comparable.

263
1121
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:28,350
Didn't you have a guilty conscience when you said that Sam Shik was a player?

264
1125
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,196
Who's the player? 
 Was I two-timing anybody?

265
1130
00:21:31,196 --> 00:21:33,951
Leading someone's heart even though you don't share similar feelings is still considered a player.

266
1134
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:39,067
I don't forgive those who played around like that. 
 Even you, Unni.

267
1139
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:41,444
And if you don't forgive? 
 What are you going to do?

268
1144
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:44,397
I'm going to expose your love life.

269
1148
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:45,660
Fine. Go ahead.

270
1152
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,693
Geez...

271
1156
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:55,756
There are so many theaters and so many movies...
 And out of all the movies, you just had to be here...

272
1161
00:21:57,643 --> 00:22:00,159
I thought you broke up with Sam Soon, so what's this all about?

273
1165
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:00,970
Then what about you, Manager Lee?

274
1169
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,125
When did this start?

275
1173
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:03,831
When did what start?

276
1177
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:09,033
I'm not even buying ingredients here. Do I have to ask permission to meet girls?

277
1181
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:13,284
But you should have given me a hint earlier. 
Who knew we lived under the same roof?

278
1186
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:18,164
-What do you mean under the same roof? 
- You got that right, same roof.

279
1191
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:28,815
That was very bold by the way.

280
1195
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:34,950
I hereby name you as my love preacher.

281
1199
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,032
<i> Number 2: Get couple rings. </i>

282
1203
00:22:48,686 --> 00:22:49,936
Give me your hand.

283
1207
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,588
It's so childish.

284
1211
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:52,854
Just give me your hand.

285
1215
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:53,859
No.

286
1219
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:56,511
You've done everything else with me so far...
 Just give me your hand.

287
1224
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:58,406
I don't like that one. 
 Those ones are better.

288
1229
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:00,132
Which one?

289
1233
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:07,927
This one's okay, too. 
 Is this 18-karat gold?

290
1238
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:16,863
Give me your hand.
 It looks so nice.

291
1243
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:26,623
Be gentle.

292
1247
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:31,492
Is it not going in? 
 Twist it. There we go.

293
1252
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,339
My hand looks so nice.

294
1256
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:42,982
How much are they? 
 It won't come off.

295
1261
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:47,110
Now...what is number one? 
 Drum roll.

296
1266
00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:51,390
Please anticipate!!!

297
1270
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,204
What is so special about this one?

298
1274
00:23:55,273 --> 00:23:57,035
You don't even have a clue?

299
1278
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:57,541
Nope.

300
1282
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,420
I was the one that was drunk, and yet you're the one who forgets.

301
1286
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:04,331
I told you before.

302
1290
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,564
When? 
 What is it?

303
1295
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:11,365
Still pretending like you don't know...

304
1299
00:24:12,944 --> 00:24:17,909
When the flowers bloom in March...

305
1303
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:20,435
<i>Tell me what kind of man you're looking for.</i>

306
1307
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:21,848
<i>A man who's a great kisser.</i>

307
1311
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:26,202
<i>You are a fox.</i>

308
1315
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:30,438
<i>What else?</i>

309
1319
00:24:30,438 --> 00:24:31,034
<i>Also...</i>

310
1323
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,941
<i>A man who I can lovingly, in front of my mom and sister, say,</i>

311
1327
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:42,313
<i>"This is my man."</i>

312
1331
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:46,449
<i>And have him lovingly tell his parents and friends...</i>

313
1335
00:24:48,077 --> 00:24:54,858
<i>"This is my girl," and tell them in that way.</i>

314
1339
00:24:57,653 --> 00:25:02,043
That's why...we're going to my house together tomorrow.

315
1343
00:25:04,992 --> 00:25:06,289
What's up with that face? 

316
1347
00:25:07,902 --> 00:25:09,682
It's not that...

317
1351
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:10,381
Then what is it?

318
1355
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:17,687
What..
 Use your words.

319
1360
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:22,984
It's just...
 I'm scared of your mother.

320
1365
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:27,641
Are you now?

321
1369
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:31,471
You're scared of my mother? 
 You're so cute.

322
1374
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,353
That's why we have to go.

323
1378
00:25:35,353 --> 00:25:37,311
What? 
 Boyfriend?

324
1383
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:41,162
Where did you get a boyfriend?

325
1387
00:25:41,162 --> 00:25:43,769
Where else? 
 By my side.

326
1392
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:45,511
Don't joke around.

327
1396
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:49,455
Where on earth would you have gotten a boyfriend?

328
1400
00:25:49,455 --> 00:25:51,223
He couldn't have fallen from the sky.

329
1404
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,119
Yes...well your daughter has some personality to get one...

330
1408
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,917
Did you know about this too?

331
1412
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:02,418
Yeah.

332
1416
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:06,287
What is this? 
 What does he do?

333
1421
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:08,072
How old? 
 His household?

334
1426
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:09,960
Why don't you just ask him when he's here later?

335
1430
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,317
What? How could he show up here when nothing has been prepared?

336
1434
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:17,224
Why prepare when we can just eat whatever we have at home?

337
1438
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:18,517
No need to worry...

338
1442
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:20,228
This won't do. 
 I need to go grocery shopping.

339
1447
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:27,580
If it's another one of those guys...

340
1451
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,655
I won't accept!

341
1455
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:32,996
What do we do?

342
1459
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,816
You have to take care of everything yourself!

343
1463
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:55,243
<i> How to have your mother-in-law like you.</i>

344
1467
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,022
Take care of the house. 
 Oppa's going out.

345
1472
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:42,545
I'll buy something delicious to eat.

346
1476
00:27:58,816 --> 00:27:59,328
You came?

347
1480
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,951
Wow! 
 Look at how you've cleaned up!

348
1485
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,624
You look so handsome!

349
1489
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:10,629
Hey...
 Am I...

350
1494
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:11,731
shaking?

351
1498
00:28:13,732 --> 00:28:14,332
Yeah.

352
1502
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:22,564
Don't be so nervous. 
 Do you think she's going to eat you?

353
1507
00:28:22,564 --> 00:28:23,068
Let's go inside.

354
1511
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:26,032
- Wait. 
 - What?

355
1516
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:42,287
What's this?

356
1520
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,216
It's your mother's gift. 
 Let's go inside.

357
1525
00:28:47,424 --> 00:28:50,483
But...it's going to be such a nuisance to clean up after it.

358
1529
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:54,875
Who are you to come in here?

359
1533
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,535
Mom, just listen to me first.

360
1537
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,612
What's there to hear? 
 Are you not going to leave?

361
1542
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,477
Mother-in-law, please accept me.

362
1546
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:02,363
Who's your mother-in-law? 
 Who?

363
1551
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:05,810
-Are you not going to leave?! 
 - Mom!

364
1556
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,819
- Get out! Get out you punk! 
 - Mother-in-law, please!

365
1561
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:10,470
Mom! What is wrong with you?!

366
1565
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,418
You have to hear me out first!

367
1569
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,149
Get out!

368
1573
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:29,209
What's that?

369
1577
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:30,760
He said it's your present.

370
1581
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,809
I felt it unsafe for women to be living by themselves..

371
1585
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:33,654
So, please raise it.

372
1589
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,522
I guess we can name it, "50 million won."

373
1593
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:41,885
Are you joking around with me right now?

374
1597
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:44,383
How can I do such a thing?

375
1601
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:45,311
Gender?

376
1605
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:46,868
Female and it's a year and a half old.

377
1609
00:29:49,768 --> 00:29:52,551
That is exactly why you can't be the one.

378
1613
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:56,297
You try raising 3 girls without getting sick by havinga thought of another girl!

379
1617
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:58,361
Then, shall I change her for a male?

380
1621
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:00,315
There's no need for one whether it be male or female.

381
1625
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:02,690
I don't like you.

382
1629
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,404
How can I think about giving my daughter to you when you don't understand what the world is like?

383
1633
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,342
Don't you think so?

384
1637
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:09,607
So stop wasting your time here and leave.

385
1641
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:10,126
Mom!

386
1645
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:12,369
What are you going to do with our baby?

387
1649
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:20,054
Honey, tell her.

388
1653
00:30:22,297 --> 00:30:25,203
Sam Soon...
 Is that true?!

389
1658
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:33,985
I went to the hospital yesterday...
 and they said I was 8 weeks in.

390
1663
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:35,591
Do you want me to get you an ultrasound picture?

391
1667
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:41,189
-You no-good daughter! You bad girl! 
 - Mom!

392
1672
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,029
Honey!

393
1676
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,337
Honey!

394
1680
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:55,621
Sam Shik! Sam Shik! 
 Open your eyes!

395
1685
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:56,150
Open your eyes!

396
1689
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,681
How could you hit him like that, mom?!

397
1693
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:02,242
Who gives you the right to hit my man like that?!

398
1697
00:31:02,242 --> 00:31:03,737
Wake up, you punk!

399
1701
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,210
Sam Shik!

400
1705
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:16,501
Are you alright?

401
1709
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:22,053
It must hurt a lot, doesn't it, honey?

402
1713
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:26,561
No. No matter what, I need to hold it in.

403
1717
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:31,706
It would've been better if I got hurt instead.

404
1721
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,778
Come here.

405
1725
00:31:40,237 --> 00:31:41,141
How could I...

406
1729
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,251
Come here.

407
1733
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,947
So this is your room.

408
1737
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:07,775
This room, compared to yours, is tiny, right?

409
1741
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:10,624
I smell something.

410
1745
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,283
What smell?

411
1749
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:15,180
Your scent.

412
1753
00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:18,559
Even in your bedroom, it has your scent.

413
1757
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,021
What are you doing?

414
1761
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:33,288
That scared me.

415
1765
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:35,798
Is it that great?

416
1769
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:38,773
It's great. 
Absolutely great.

417
1774
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,319
Would it break your knuckles to knock?

418
1778
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:42,938
Yeah, they'd break.

419
1782
00:32:44,415 --> 00:32:44,992
You better come out.

420
1786
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:47,021
Please come out.

421
1790
00:32:57,955 --> 00:32:58,806
Honey, brace yourself.

422
1794
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,959
This is not your ordinary stage.

423
1798
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:03,403
Stage?

424
1802
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:08,066
My brother-in-law and eldest sister made it through this stage very well.

425
1806
00:33:11,344 --> 00:33:14,429
As the father of the child, it's been a tradition to drink this.

426
1810
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:16,458
While you drink this, you have to answer my questions.

427
1814
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,289
Alright.

428
1818
00:33:27,904 --> 00:33:28,437
It's fine.

429
1822
00:33:37,608 --> 00:33:38,415
What are you doing? Let's drink.

430
1826
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,968
Alright. 
 So, what's your name again?

431
1831
00:33:54,968 --> 00:33:58,661
It's Hyun Jin Hun, with Jin as in "being real."

432
1835
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,545
Age?

433
1839
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:01,633
-27. 
 -What?

434
1844
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:02,991
That young?

435
1848
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:06,189
Mom, dating younger people is the trend nowadays.

436
1852
00:34:06,189 --> 00:34:06,917
You just stay still.

437
1856
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:11,119
-You've graduated from university? 
 -Yes.

438
1861
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,416
-Drink up. 
 -Yes.

439
1866
00:34:23,926 --> 00:34:26,456
-Have you changed a lightbulb before? 
 -I'm sorry?

440
1871
00:34:26,456 --> 00:34:30,247
-Have you changed a lightbulb before? 
 -No.

441
1876
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:32,672
Have you done any handiwork before? 
 - No.

442
1881
00:34:32,672 --> 00:34:35,978
-So, I guess you've never dug a hole before either. 
 -Yes.

443
1886
00:34:35,978 --> 00:34:36,943
Mom.

444
1890
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:40,429
Who on earth digs a hole nowadays when we have refridgerators to keep things cool?

445
1894
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,780
Are you saying I'm not updated with the time?

446
1898
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,422
Why do you keep asking these questions?

447
1902
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:47,241
Starting from now, I'll work hard to learn. I'll change lightbulbs and start handiwork...

448
1906
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:49,673
And when winter arrives, please call me, and I'll dig a hole for kimchi.

449
1910
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:56,887
So, your mother owns a hotel? 
 - Yes.

450
1915
00:34:58,518 --> 00:35:00,814
Then why are you working at a restaurant rather than the hotel?

451
1919
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:02,944
Because that's mother's work.

452
1923
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:04,704
Then are you going to continue working at the restaurant?

453
1927
00:35:04,704 --> 00:35:06,056
Only temporarily. 
 - Temporarily?-

454
1932
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:10,613
Then, do you plan on returning to work in the hotel?

455
1936
00:35:10,613 --> 00:35:11,542
Yes.

456
1940
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:18,198
-What about siblings? 
 - I'm an only child.

457
1945
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:19,557
I guess my Sam Soon will have to take care of your mother then.

458
1949
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:21,886
Later on...yes...

459
1953
00:35:23,892 --> 00:35:26,529
You're mother is not exactly like other people...

460
1957
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:28,169
-How do you know that, mom? 
- You just keep your mouth shut.

461
1962
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,685
By the looks of it...

462
1966
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:36,389
The lifestyles between your household and our household are vastly different.

463
1970
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,718
It's a hotel you're running and not just a simple small business.

464
1974
00:35:40,718 --> 00:35:43,026
Do you think your mother will agree to this marriage?

465
1978
00:35:43,026 --> 00:35:46,757
If you accept, then it will be easy for me to take care of the rest.

466
1982
00:35:46,757 --> 00:35:47,792
- And if I don't accept? 
 - Mom!

467
1987
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:53,585
Then....
 What are we going to do with our child?

468
1992
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:55,819
-We even thought of names. 
 - What?

469
1997
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:59,370
First child mountain, second child field, third child sea...

470
2001
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,741
You plan on having 3 kids?

471
2005
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,373
Yes. We plan on using all of our energy.

472
2009
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:04,635
Forget it. 
 I only want 2.

473
2014
00:36:05,885 --> 00:36:08,156
I like having big families.

474
2018
00:36:08,156 --> 00:36:09,218
-Forget it. 
 - That sounds good.

475
2023
00:36:10,262 --> 00:36:12,155
I'll put my best efforts, mother-in-law.

476
2027
00:36:12,155 --> 00:36:13,061
I'm not your mother-in-law just yet.

477
2031
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:15,211
-Drink.
 - Yes.

478
2036
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:41,340
You just get more handsome with every look.

479
2040
00:39:43,435 --> 00:39:45,693
His skin is so clear...

480
2044
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:50,518
Just look at his eyelashes...

481
2048
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,172
I thought I saw a dimple. 
 Where is it?

482
2053
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:00,764
Right there.

483
2057
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:08,326
How on earth did my Sam Soon get a man like this?

484
2061
00:40:10,456 --> 00:40:13,429
I guess you can see everything the world has when you live a long life.

485
2065
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,831
Hello?

486
2069
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,132
<i> Sorry. 
 Did I wake you? </i>

487
2074
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:02,532
No, it's okay.

488
2078
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:06,534
What's up?

489
2082
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:11,035
<i> Well, if it's okay with you, do you want to go watch a matinee movie with me? </i>

490
2086
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:11,735
What?!

491
2090
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,136
Let's go.

492
2094
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:50,437
Let's go get some fresh air.

493
2098
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:04,439
Sorry, I keep changing my mind.

494
2102
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,340
I thought I was going to suffocate.

495
2106
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,441
There's no air inside.

496
2110
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:10,342
You didn't sleep last night, did you?

497
2114
00:42:10,342 --> 00:42:11,143
What?

498
2118
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:13,543
You stayed up all night.

499
2122
00:42:13,543 --> 00:42:19,444
Yeah, I couldn't go to sleep. So, you know,  I just tossing and turning...and then my back was aching.

500
2126
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:22,644
Forget it, let's just eat. 
 I want to eat something cold.

501
2131
00:42:38,845 --> 00:42:39,545
Hee Jin!

502
2135
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:51,646
Hee Jin!

503
2139
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:55,747
Hee Jin, you okay?

504
2143
00:43:06,748 --> 00:43:08,748
Hee Jin, you okay?

505
2147
00:43:11,978 --> 00:43:13,770
How is it? 
 Does it relieve your hangover?

506
2152
00:43:15,074 --> 00:43:17,447
Yes. This the first time I've ever had such delicious bean sprout soup.

507
2156
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:22,689
That's a relief that it's to your liking, Hun-ney.

508
2160
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:28,263
Stop calling him Sam Shik.

509
2164
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:31,332
What on earth is Sam Shik when he already has a nice name?

510
2168
00:43:31,332 --> 00:43:32,728
It's much nicer. Hun-ney.

511
2172
00:43:35,586 --> 00:43:37,464
What can I do with you, mom?

512
2176
00:43:37,464 --> 00:43:38,956
Can't do anything with you, Mrs. Park Bong-Sook.

513
2180
00:43:41,102 --> 00:43:42,745
Thank you.

514
2184
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,300
It's fine. Just eat.

515
2188
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,083
Honey, sit down.

516
2192
00:43:50,515 --> 00:43:51,405
Here.

517
2196
00:43:57,987 --> 00:44:01,127
Aw, our Hun-ney even looks attractive when he eats.

518
2200
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,361
Honey, isn't that your cellphone?

519
2204
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:15,346
Mother, I'm going to answer my phone.

520
2208
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:25,955
Hey, Myung-Tae.

521
2212
00:44:28,047 --> 00:44:29,687
Right now? 
 Why?

522
2217
00:44:45,191 --> 00:44:47,358
What's the matter? 
 What wrong with Hee Jin?

523
2222
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:48,116
Ask him.

524
2226
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:32,417
I wouldn't be too worried. She had an examination recently. It shouldn't be too serious.

525
2230
00:45:34,718 --> 00:45:37,118
I think it's anorexia nervosa.

526
2234
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:42,719
In the last three days, she hasn't had anything in her stomach except for milk.

527
2238
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,620
She's been under  a lot of stress.

528
2242
00:47:19,658 --> 00:47:20,941
What?

529
2246
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:22,027
You're Shim Sam Soon, right?

530
2250
00:47:24,245 --> 00:47:27,633
I am Sam Soon, but it's Kim rather than Shim.

531
2254
00:47:36,194 --> 00:47:37,613
What are you doing?

532
2258
00:47:37,613 --> 00:47:39,320
What do you think you're doing?!

533
2262
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,063
Are you crazy?! 
 Can you let go?!

534
2267
00:47:42,063 --> 00:47:44,220
You jerk! Let go!

535
2271
00:47:46,054 --> 00:47:48,647
Hey! How could you go through someone else's bag?!

536
2275
00:47:48,647 --> 00:47:49,542
You crazy man!

537
2279
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,038
That!

538
2283
00:47:55,713 --> 00:47:58,976
Are you not going to give it back?
 Do you know how important that is?!

539
2288
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:03,979
Give it back. 
 Are you not going to give it back?!

540
2293
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:13,724
You bastard! 
 You crazy man!

541
2298
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,011
Are you insane?! 
 You punk!

542
2303
00:48:23,418 --> 00:48:24,352
<i> President: Hyun Jin-hun </i>

543
2307
00:48:26,374 --> 00:48:27,420
Why do you have this?

544
2311
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:35,739
<i>I heard it's invalid if you don't register within a month? I'm going to patrol the place, so you better give up now.</i>

545
2315
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:37,841
<i>I heard it's invalid if you don't register within a month? I'm going to patrol the place, so you better give up now.</i>

546
2319
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:42,686
That crazy bastard! 
 That bastard!

547
2324
00:48:43,743 --> 00:48:45,428
That punk!

548
2328
00:48:49,089 --> 00:48:50,825
That bastard has some nerve to hire a guy!

549
2332
00:48:52,647 --> 00:48:53,967
I'm not standing still anymore.

550
2336
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:20,685
The results were the same as last time. 
 They're clean.

551
2341
00:49:20,685 --> 00:49:21,435
Then what's the reason?

552
2345
00:49:23,536 --> 00:49:24,761
Hee Jin neglected to eat or drink.

553
2349
00:49:25,765 --> 00:49:28,469
Why is she like this now? 
 She was fine before.

554
2354
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,970
You were right... it's anorexia.

555
2358
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:28,543
It's off again...

556
2362
00:50:30,811 --> 00:50:32,787
What is he up to?

557
2366
00:51:19,482 --> 00:51:20,324
You're awake?

558
2370
00:51:22,806 --> 00:51:23,624
Are you okay?

559
2374
00:51:25,877 --> 00:51:26,799
Why did you come?

560
2378
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,534
You wouldn't have come to see me if I was like this?

561
2382
00:51:36,282 --> 00:51:36,973
What about Henry?

562
2386
00:51:38,718 --> 00:51:40,192
He waited for you and left just a while ago.

563
2390
00:51:52,106 --> 00:51:52,859
I'm sorry.

564
2394
00:51:58,326 --> 00:52:03,818
I thought three years were going to mean nothing to us.

565
2398
00:52:06,677 --> 00:52:10,628
Out of sight, out of mind.

566
2402
00:52:12,984 --> 00:52:15,136
I wanted to prove that wrong.

567
2406
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:22,074
They said time was medicine...

568
2410
00:52:23,862 --> 00:52:26,072
but it became an illness for us.

569
2414
00:52:34,769 --> 00:52:39,422
Don't. You're still weak. 
 Just rest.

570
2419
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:40,631
No. I want to go.

571
2423
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:43,765
Do you know how much weight you've lost?

572
2427
00:52:44,853 --> 00:52:47,666
You weigh only 80% of your normal weight.

573
2431
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:48,621
You'll be in critical condition if you get worse.

574
2435
00:52:50,343 --> 00:52:53,109
It's not like being here if going to help either.

575
2439
00:53:02,664 --> 00:53:05,463
I'm like a leading actress in a movie, aren't I?

576
2443
00:53:10,442 --> 00:53:12,752
Then... stay at my house.

577
2447
00:53:22,777 --> 00:53:24,327
What are you looking at? 
 Here.

578
2452
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:29,916
Eat this.

579
2456
00:53:33,912 --> 00:53:38,387
Hey, "50 Million Won". 
 My household isn't rich, okay?

580
2461
00:53:39,864 --> 00:53:43,586
So, just eat the leftovers, okay?

581
2465
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:50,396
That's right.

582
2469
00:53:52,005 --> 00:53:54,234
Why are you so picky? That's meat right there.

583
2473
00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:03,873
Where and what do you think your owner is doing right now?

584
2477
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:09,849
You little punk. Your owner's asking you a question, and you're not even answering...

585
2481
00:54:11,827 --> 00:54:13,408
You are thick-skinned.

586
2485
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:19,026
But you're good-looking... just like your owner.

587
2489
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:45,576
His phone is still off... I have had no contact with him because his phone's been off all day.

588
2493
00:54:52,151 --> 00:54:53,542
I wonder if anything happened...

589
2497
00:54:55,135 --> 00:55:01,497
He didn't go to work either...
 I wonder what that phone call was about...

590
2502
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,723
No. Just drop me off at my house.

591
2506
00:55:10,028 --> 00:55:11,771
It's because you're home alone all the time.

592
2510
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:15,427
Is this for your own comfort?

593
2514
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:20,066
That's right. 
 Think of it that way.

594
2519
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:22,698
Jin Hun...

595
2523
00:55:26,158 --> 00:55:28,274
This is no longer your business to worry.

596
2527
00:55:30,049 --> 00:55:32,546
I don't want this kind of pity from you.

597
2531
00:55:34,449 --> 00:55:38,035
Just rest at my place for tonight. 
 I'll drop you off at Henry's tomorrow.

598
2536
00:55:39,281 --> 00:55:40,927
Kim Sam Soon will hate this if she finds out.

599
2540
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:43,152
She'll understand.

600
2544
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:45,565
Jin Hun...

601
2548
00:55:49,282 --> 00:55:50,431
I can never forget you.

2552
00:55:54,411 --> 00:55:57,954
You're hardened like a fossil, a place in a part of my heart.

603
2556
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:03,269
She'll even understand that.

604
2560
00:56:31,005 --> 00:56:31,679
Hun...

605
2564
00:56:35,082 --> 00:56:35,753
Honey!

606
2568
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,474
Honey, are you not at home?

607
2572
00:56:45,261 --> 00:56:46,047
Sam Shik!

608
2576
00:56:49,828 --> 00:56:51,803
Sam Shik! 
Are you home?
