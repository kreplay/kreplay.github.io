3
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:17,485
-What are you doing? There are customers waiting. 
-Sorry.

2
8
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:40,278
Hey, Hairy! Hairy,  bring the chicken stock.

3
12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,700
Hey, SOB, where are you when it's busy?  Hey, Hairy!

4
16
00:00:56,476 --> 00:00:57,834
Are you here to wash your hands?

5
20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,300
Yes.

6
24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,200
Go ahead and wash them.

7
28
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,822
What do I do?!

8
32
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,810
That was my first kiss!

9
36
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,400
My first kiss is gone...
 How can I live?

10
41
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,900
What can I do?

11
45
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,100
That pyscho,  I want to tear out his beard!

12
49
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,809
What is grandmother's name?

13
53
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,161
Na Hyun Sook President.

14
57
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:46,058
My goodness! 
 She even knows I'm president!

15
62
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:47,617
Then what about auntie's name?

16
66
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:49,232
Yoon Hyun Suk secretary.

17
70
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:51,495
Your age?

18
74
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,300
Seven years old.

19
78
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:56,948
Where are we going right now, Mi Joo?

20
82
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,100
We're going to kindergarten.

21
86
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:01,163
What are we going to do there?

22
90
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:07,120
Dance, sing, and do work.  I'm also going to make some friends.

23
94
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,841
Oh really?  Have you made lots of friends?

24
98
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,500
Yes.

25
102
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,983
Mi Joo...

26
106
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:18,816
Are you going to hang out and eat with your friends?

27
110
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,700
- Yes.  But, Grandmother. 
 -Yeah?

28
115
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,500
When is Uncle coming back?

29
119
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,300
He's only sent one postcard during his trip. 
 What on earth is he doing?

30
124
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,271
Old saying, "No news is better than bad news".

31
128
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:41,265
- This.  
 What is this?

32
133
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
My resignation.

33
137
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,100
You're not going to watch the dog fights anymore? 
 Are you bored?

34
142
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,833
I'm going on a trip.

35
146
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,406
If you want to go on vacation, then you can just take some time off. What is this?

36
150
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:59,299
It's going to be long.

37
154
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:01,283
How long?   A month?

38
158
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:04,938
A couple of years.  I'm going to travel the world.

39
162
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:06,408
Did you eat something bad?

40
166
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:08,282
It's only morning.  What is this nonsense?

41
170
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:10,456
This is my last dream.

42
174
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,388
Then why didn't you do it when you were younger rather than thinking about it now?

43
178
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,763
I thought I would be young forever.

44
182
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:18,957
After my parents passed away, you took me in.

45
186
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:21,891
I lived in a world not knowing anything.

46
190
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:24,974
I lived a comfortable life barely knowing my own age...

47
194
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,200
and how much time I've been wasting.

48
198
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:30,443
This is the only thing I need to do now.

49
202
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,605
-No. 
- I've already booked my tickets.

50
207
00:03:32,605 --> 00:03:34,676
With whose permission?  Cancel them.

51
211
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,700
I've already found a replacement.  She will be here next week.

52
215
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:42,941
Hey!  Am I the President, or are you the President!?

53
219
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:51,509
50 Million Won, let's eat.

54
223
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,500
You can't not eat even if your owner's not here.

55
227
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,400
What on earth has Jin Hun been doing?

56
231
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,400
Hurry up and eat.

57
235
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,700
You have to eat! Hurry up!

58
239
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,130
Even its hard ... Hurry.

59
243
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,900
What's the matter?

60
247
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:16,153
You have to eat. Eat.  Come out.

61
251
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,480
Come out.  Right now.

62
255
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,670
Hurry and eat.

63
259
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,500
<i> He didn't come back after one week.</i>

64
263
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:40,489
<i> One month passed...and then two months...</i>

65
267
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,574
<i> Mi Joo got a postcard saying he's been well. </i>

66
271
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:49,941
<i> But, I have not received a single phone call or postcard.  Not a single thing. </i>

67
275
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,400
<i> I know very well that trying to understand each other is a very difficult task </i>

68
279
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:42,633
-This one would be better, wouldn't it? 
 -Yes.

69
284
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:48,662
<i> I don't even have the illusion that I know him well. 
 but  still this is not fair. </i>

70
289
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:54,444
<i> But then again. How can I understand someone else,  when I can barely understand myself? </i>

71
293
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:59,811
I shall bring the payment next time! Thank you! 
 Oh..I almost forgot this. Bye.

72
298
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:08,371
<i>I don't know whether I'm still waiting for him... Or if I've given up on him.</i>

73
302
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,820
This size is  ...

74
306
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:15,599
Can I get twenty of these? 
 How much are they?

75
311
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,800
- They are 300 won each. 
 - 300 won?

76
316
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,499
-How much are they each? 
 -Those are 1000 won.

77
321
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,100
-Are they all the same? 
 -These ones are 1000, while those ones are 1500.

78
326
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,400
I'll get these.

79
330
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,580
- Ahjussi! Can I get this heart one as a freebie? 
 - Yes.

80
335
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,190
It's so cute.

81
339
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:27,950
<i> Love like you've never been hurt before. Alfredo Di Souza. </i>

82
343
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,824
<i>Dance like no one's watching. </i>

83
347
00:07:31,824 --> 00:07:35,967
<i> Love like you've never been hurt before. </i>

84
351
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:39,926
<i> Sing like no one is listening. </i>

85
355
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,582
<i>Work like you don't need money. </i>

86
359
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,700
<i> Live like today is the last day. </i>

87
363
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,600
<i> It's true...I want to live like that. </i>

88
367
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,100
<i> I want to love like I've never been hurt before. </i>

89
371
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:35,085
<i>But because of this ending... I want to change those quotes. </i>

90
375
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,000
<i> If you don't want to get hurt, then don't love. </i>

91
379
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Kim Sam Soon?

92
383
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,300
What brings you here?

93
387
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,400
- What? You met that guy again?
  - Yeah.

94
392
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,500
He asked if I wanted to go to the movies with him this weekend.

95
396
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:12,157
So what did you say?  You're...not rejecting him are you?

96
400
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,700
-I said yes. 
 -Really?

97
405
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:16,325
You did well.

98
409
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:19,488
This is the first time you've done something right for a change.

99
413
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:22,613
If he's still interested after you rejected him twice...

100
417
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,188
This isn't normal fate.

101
421
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:27,615
Starting from now, you can forget about Sam Shik,

102
425
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:30,164
and work things out with the new guy, okay?

103
429
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:34,980
Hey, Kim Sam Soon!

104
433
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,436
Are you still waiting for that guy?

105
437
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:39,583
Waiting shwaiting!  That doesn't pay the rent.

106
441
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,700
-Is he the only man? 
 -That's right! That's the spirit!

107
446
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,963
But, what did we do wrong? 
 We barely have any orders!

108
451
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:54,075
I wish they would just click and put an order in.

109
455
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,825
-How many customers have we had today? 
 -Seven.

110
460
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:59,444
See?!   This is what happens!

111
464
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:01,407
We should have stuck with the name, 'Momo'!

112
468
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,000
You think anybody would' have come in if we named it, "Momo?'

113
472
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:09,911
We can't continue like this. We'd defnitely attract more customers if we made a commercial

114
476
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,576
I don't want to.

115
480
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:15,765
If we make a commercial, then various other stores will start popping up, doing the same thing.

116
484
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:23,877
Hey, Sam Soon..
 Come here.

117
489
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:27,288
-What? 
 -Hey...Isn't this an order?

118
494
00:10:27,288 --> 00:10:28,294
What?

119
498
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,300
What is it?

120
502
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,100
Look here!

121
506
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,163
<i> One honey cake order. </i>

122
510
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,400
One honey cake order...for delivery...

123
514
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:51,920
We got an order!  We got an order.

124
518
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,200
<i>Patissier Samsuni</i>

125
522
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,360
<i>Cafe www.samsuni.com</i>

126
526
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,700
Don't screw up and do well.

127
530
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,986
What if we get more orders?

128
534
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:51,295
Today's almost done for the day anyway.

129
538
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
I'm going to go crazy.

130
542
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,200
Hello.

131
546
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:00,918
-Do I look okay? 
- You look pretty.

132
551
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,653
I don't look fat? 
 You look sexy. Glamorous even.

133
556
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,487
You don't see any fat? 
 I said you look fine.

134
561
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,200
I'll get going.

135
565
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,200
You look exceptionally pretty today.

136
569
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,200
But still, he doesn't stand out like Sam Shik.

137
573
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,200
Even so...they were a good match.

138
577
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,200
Is there anywhere you want to go?

139
581
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,810
No. Well...I...
 I came out not really having any preference.

140
586
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,800
Then, let's watch the movie first. 
 I have the tickets.

141
591
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,804
Alright.

142
595
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,400
By chance...
 Is he that President?

143
600
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,700
Who said you could two-time? 
 Get out.

144
605
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,600
I'm sorry for doing this again. 
 Hurry up and get out.

145
610
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:24,594
- Let's go. 
 - What are you doing? Get out.

146
615
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:27,928
Ahjussi, who are you? 
Do you know me?

147
620
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Are you joking right now?

148
624
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,200
Let's go. 
 I don't know this person.

149
629
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,930
Sam Soon.

150
633
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,070
<i>You didn't hear me.  That night the chopper dropped me off for our anniversary dinner</i>

151
637
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,800
<i>- No.
- No?</i>

152
642
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,350
<i>Percussion ______.  I was partially deaf that night.</i>

153
646
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,700
Get up.

154
650
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,600
Why the heck are you acting like this?

155
654
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Get up so we can talk outside.

156
658
00:14:17,728 --> 00:14:19,090
Look here.

157
662
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,681
I didn't know what was going on before, but I don't think today will do.

158
666
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:24,044
-Today is the real thing. 
 -Sam Soon doesn't want to.

159
671
00:14:24,044 --> 00:14:26,569
It's just a misunderstanding, but it's the real deal today.

160
675
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:28,850
- Don't you see that she doesn't want to be with you? 
 - She's my woman.

161
680
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,900
Can you sit down? We can't see!

162
684
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,000
Get out.

163
688
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,700
I'm very sorry.

164
692
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,400
This wasn't supposed to be like this. I'm very sorry.

165
696
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,700
Let's talk on the way.

166
700
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,800
You and I are over.

167
704
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,100
Why are you acting like this again?

168
708
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,400
You at least have to tell me what's going on.

169
712
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,900
Is it because I didn't call you?

170
716
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,700
I already told you.  I didn't call because it might have made you upset.

171
720
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,200
Come to my house. We'll talk there.

172
724
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,200
Are you really going to be like this? 
 Do you have any idea much I've missed you?

173
729
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,200
Why are you doing this, mister?

174
733
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Do you know me?

175
737
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:50,036
Hey Kim Sam Soon! 
Are you not going to stay right there?!

176
742
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,600
-Why are you doing, mister? 
-I'm sorry.

177
747
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:32,900
-About what? 
- I'm sorry, so just let it go.

178
752
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,500
Why would I be upset with you?  We don't know each other.

179
756
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:39,300
What should I do? Do you want me to go on my knees?

180
760
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,800
Do you think you can afford to do that with your legs?

181
764
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,700
I'm sorry.  Forgive me.

182
768
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:18,200
Mister, spend this wisely. Alright?

183
772
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,800
Someday, a day of opportunity will come for you.

184
776
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,925
I can probably understand how you feel right now..but, don't you think this is too harsh?

185
780
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,871
You should at least tell me why you're upset and listen to what I have to say.

186
784
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,700
Come to my house.

187
788
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't you get it?

188
792
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,900
You really have no idea.

189
796
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:48,131
Then I guess you probably know how many tears I've shed during that time.

190
800
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:50,892
That's why we should discuss this at my house.

191
804
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:54,210
Do you think it was only me?

192
808
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,086
How do you think my mom felt?

193
812
00:17:56,086 --> 00:18:00,024
Do you have any idea how worried she was about you?  Whether or not you've been in an accident because you were so far away?

194
816
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:02,994
Do you know how many times she's prayed for you?

195
820
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:07,868
What about my sister?  She only said she hated you with her words.

196
824
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:11,273
But in reality, she does like you. 
 Do you know how worried she was about you?

197
829
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:15,549
We heard Mi Joo was sent a postcard.

198
833
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,118
And we three felt so neglected.

199
837
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,100
But despite all that, my mom still said that she was so relieved that you weren't in any accidents.

200
841
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,500
We all felt relief.

201
845
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,500
What are you?

202
849
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Who are you to make us feel like this?! Why?

203
853
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:39,243
I sent you postcards.

204
857
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,011
What?  Did you send one inf your dreams?

205
861
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,900
You didn't get any?

206
865
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,300
I'm speechless.  Absolutely speechless.

207
869
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
<i> Who is it? </i>

208
873
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:05,231
It's me,Mother-in-law. Hun.

209
877
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,800
I've returned, still strong and healthy. 
 I was wondering if you could open the door.

210
882
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,600
<i> Wait. </i>

211
886
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,100
Hello, Mother-in-law.

212
890
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,776
Who is your mother-in-law?  Who?!

213
894
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:27,769
We don't need someone like you.  Don't come back here!

214
898
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:31,263
Also!  You...

215
902
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Come here. Come here.  Take this with you. She refuses to eat.

216
906
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:56,220
<i>Whether something the matter is happening to  me or </i>

217
910
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Hey, 50 Million Won.

218
914
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,200
♬What on earth happened? <i>Because some image is shaking me up </i>♬

219
918
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:14,300
Use your words.  Your words.
 ♬<i>For a second time again, it seems like it wasn't just me.</i>♬

220
923
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,660
♬<i>Don't say that it wasn't you who came looking for me. </i>♬

221
927
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:27,744
The soup's a little salty, isn't it?

222
931
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:34,303
I guess your taste buds are changing because you're aging.

223
935
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:37,641
It something that happens as you age. You'll understand.

224
939
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,201
But...if we don't have 50 million won...What are we going to do with our leftovers?

225
943
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:51,950
Who knows.  I guess we'll just have to throw it away.

226
947
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:05,570
<i>Love like that is smiling.</i>

227
951
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,600
<i>That part of me doesn't want to say anything.</i>

228
955
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,777
What is this suddenly at this time of the night?

229
959
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:28,574
A man who had a few to drink came by and brought this over.

230
963
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,800
He said he kept getting postcards from a stranger.

231
967
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:37,480
Because the postcards  kept coming each day, he couldn't throw them away so he collected them.

232
971
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,717
As he was laughing about the recipient's name being 'Sam Soon.'

233
975
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,489
I immediately thought of you, so I brought them over.

234
979
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:45,522
My goodness.  What is all this?

235
983
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:49,592
Then...are you saying he was sending them to the wrong address the whole time?

236
987
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,500
<i>This is the coffee city, Seattle.</i>

237
991
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:14,961
<i> Earlier, I went into a Starbucks, and had a cup of coffee. </i>

238
995
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:17,324
<i> I couldn't really tell the difference in taste. </i>

239
999
00:22:17,324 --> 00:22:21,646
<i> I'm currently staying in a 3-star hotel in downtown Seattle...</i>

240
1003
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:24,105
<i> But, the hygiene here is absolutely terrible. </i>

241
1007
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:36,393
<i> This place is spectacular. </i>

242
1011
00:22:36,393 --> 00:22:41,517
<i> Although I have to interest in gambling, I managed to lose $100 in 10 minutes. </i>

243
1015
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:43,841
<i> It's a top tourist attraction, so the hotel was great. </i>

244
1019
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:57,910
<i> I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, which is near all the Broadway theatres.</i>

245
1023
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,697
<i> It's been the most expensive hotel I've stayed in so far.</i>

246
1027
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:04,535
<i> I can already hear you nagging about my spending. </i>

247
1031
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,700
<i>But I learned as much as the expenses. </i>

248
1035
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,000
<i> The night life here is wonderful. </i>

249
1039
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,400
<i> It would've been better if you were here with me. </i>

250
1043
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,400
<i> Sam Soon... I miss you. </i>

251
1047
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Say my address.

252
1051
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,100
You told me you sent me postcards.  Recite my address.

253
1055
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,000
Seoul, ChongRo Go, Puam Dong, #27, 2nd row, 5th box.

254
1059
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,400
Read this.

255
1063
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:06,939
<i> Seoul, ChongRo Go, Puam Dong, #17, 2nd row, 5th box</i>

256
1067
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,000
You're a dummy, aren't you?

257
1071
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:18,168
For now...Apologize to my mom.

258
1075
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:20,937
If my mother forgives you ...

259
1079
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:27,900
If not... I can't either.

260
1083
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,100
I came back safely, Mother-in-law.

261
1087
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:00,753
I was originally only going to send my friend off.  But, I had a lot to think about while I was there.

262
1091
00:25:00,753 --> 00:25:03,837
I'm almost 30, and need to get married.

263
1095
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,304
I thought about how Sam Soon and I were going to live.

264
1099
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,700
I thought about how my mother, aging quickly and thought about how we were going live.

265
1103
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:14,548
As a result, I constantly changed hotels.

266
1107
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,382
Like how you have to make lots of different foods to see which one tastes better.

267
1111
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,120
Although I spent all the money I've earned during my duration working at the restaurant,

268
1115
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,000
I considered it a learning opportunity.

269
1119
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,831
Even so, don't you think 2 months was too long?

270
1123
00:25:29,831 --> 00:25:32,393
I also visited some friends over there.

271
1127
00:25:32,393 --> 00:25:33,490
Still, it was too long.

272
1131
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,116
I traveled as well.  Since this would be my last time travelling alone.

273
1135
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:40,035
So, how did it feel to be travelling alone?

274
1139
00:25:41,745 --> 00:25:43,364
How did it feel?

275
1143
00:25:43,364 --> 00:25:47,152
I realized how important those beside me were.

276
1147
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,100
Then you should have at least called!  Do they not have phones there?

277
1151
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,000
If I called...

278
1155
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:01,200
I was afraid that my heart would grow weak, and I'd come straight back if I heard Sam Soon's voice.

279
1159
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:04,273
So, I sent postcards instead, but I mixed up the address.

280
1163
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,588
Please forgive me, mother-in-law.

281
1167
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,900
How do you feel about this, Sam Soon? Should I forgive him?

282
1171
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,782
I don't know.  You decide, mom.

283
1175
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:21,439
Why are you asking me when he's your boyfriend?

284
1179
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:25,361
If you forgive him...Then, I'll do the same.

285
1183
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:28,547
-Mom, you decide. 
-I don't know! You decide!

286
1188
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,000
Why?You said I had terrible judgment for men.

287
1192
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:39,011
Should we...go to a noraebang again?

288
1196
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,000
Did someone say you can smile?

289
1200
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,500
Did you have dinner?

290
1204
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,300
I haven't eaten yet, Mother-in-law.

291
1208
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,808
Our family has no interest in men who starve themselves.

292
1212
00:26:58,808 --> 00:27:00,933
Next time, don't come here on an empty stomach.

293
1216
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:01,965
Yes, Mother-in-law.

294
1220
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:04,539
Stay and have dinner before you leave.

295
1224
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,100
Mother-in-law...although you're very kind... Can I borrow Sam Soon just for one night?

296
1228
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,219
Why did you call me?

297
1232
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,500
-Is that the first thing you say to someone who called you over? 
-Sit down.

298
1237
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:36,975
-Did you know Jin Hun came back? 
-He stopped by at our place.

299
1242
00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:39,219
That jerk sure is quick.

300
1246
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:41,268
Why do you always kill my mood?

301
1250
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:42,878
Are you going to keep speaking casually?

302
1254
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:45,562
Why are you arguing with me again? 
 Speak csually if you wish.

303
1259
00:27:45,562 --> 00:27:47,611
I don't want to speak casually  to a person 
 who is not close to me.

304
1264
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:50,423
I wonder what is underneath your skin.

305
1268
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:52,835
I wonder if it's a fox or a tiger.

306
1272
00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:56,237
Not close?  If we're not close, then what is the close relationship?

307
1276
00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:58,321
We're more than close.

308
1280
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:00,557
Stop putting us as 'we'.

309
1284
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,026
If people saw us, they'd think we're dating.

310
1288
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,100
I'm going to go insane.

311
1292
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,379
How can you let a thought like that enter your head?

312
1296
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:09,871
What have you been thinking of these days?

313
1300
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:13,179
Right now...What cake would sell the best.

314
1304
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:14,527
That's all I've been thinking of.

315
1308
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,822
Fine.  Think about me, too.

316
1312
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:19,398
Think over about my proposal from before.

317
1316
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,516
I already told I don't want to.

318
1320
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:23,374
I won't ask you to clean, and I'll be the one to cook.

319
1324
00:28:23,374 --> 00:28:25,250
I'm just asking that we eat together.

320
1328
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,477
I already have someone to eat with.

321
1332
00:28:26,477 --> 00:28:29,098
Isn't it boring to be eating with the same person? Change!

322
1336
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,800
It's not boring.

323
1340
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:36,303
What are you going to do now that you're older?  I can see you age right now.

324
1344
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:40,394
Your mother will pass away... And your younger sister will have her own to take care of.

325
1348
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:44,398
And you'll be an old grandmother. Do you want to die being a lonely, old grandmother?

326
1352
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,895
I'll go to a very nice retirement town. 
 I have good plan & insurance as well.

327
1357
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:51,600
Invest it in me, I'll guarantee your life, entire life.

328
1361
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,000
Forget it.

329
1365
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:57,635
Since I'm here already, let's go greet your mother.

330
1369
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,100
Are you crazy?!

331
1373
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,600
<i> -Is that you, Yi Young? </i> 
 -Yes!

332
1378
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,400
You're finally trapped. Let's just see who's going to win now.

333
1382
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,300
Who is it?

334
1386
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,386
<i> Yes, hello. My name is Lee Hyun Woo. </i>

335
1390
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,800
I happen to be your daughter's boyfriend.

336
1394
00:29:48,768 --> 00:29:50,586
Do you have a boyfriend?

337
1398
00:29:51,282 --> 00:29:52,677
No.  Why?

338
1402
00:29:52,677 --> 00:29:55,216
Then who's this guy on the speaker?  He said he's your lover.

339
1406
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,393
That man is insane!

340
1410
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,100
Don't worry about it mom. He's insane. I'll take care of it myself.

341
1414
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:06,329
This is just unbearable!

342
1418
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,000
I'll be right back.

343
1422
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:24,200
- What's this? 
- You think you were able to seduce me with a doll?

344
1427
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,600
Wake up, mister.

345
1431
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,100
Fine. I'm sorry I wasn't suave or cool enough for you.

346
1435
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,500
I'll come back tomorrow.

347
1439
00:30:42,651 --> 00:30:44,684
You said you would take care of everything, you jerk!

348
1443
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:47,056
What have you done for last 2 months??

349
1447
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,800
He just won't quit.

350
1451
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Where's your ring?

351
1455
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,000
Why did you take it off?

352
1459
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,900
Because I hate you.

353
1463
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,866
You're dead if you take it off ever again.

354
1467
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,200
Just try to hurt me again and you're dead.

355
1471
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,800
How much weight did you lose?

356
1475
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:42,853
I didn't lose any.

357
1479
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,200
Why not?

358
1483
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,200
I gain more weight when I'm under stress.

359
1487
00:31:48,814 --> 00:31:52,327
I can't take it anymore!  It's been a month.

360
1491
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,000
Now I'm the one who can't stand it.

361
1495
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,241
This won't do.  I'm going to eat you!

362
1499
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,400
I, too, will eat your lips!

363
1503
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Wait!

364
1507
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:09,503
What?

365
1511
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:13,105
You didn't say that you loved me.

366
1515
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:15,928
-Is that important right now? 
-Yes, it is.

367
1520
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,700
If you don't tell me you love me... It won't happen.

368
1524
00:32:19,513 --> 00:32:20,939
-Do I have to use words to show it? 
-Yes, you do.

369
1529
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,404
Forget it.

370
1533
00:32:22,404 --> 00:32:23,753
What do you mean forget it?

371
1537
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,700
You need to do it. Hurry up and tell me you love me.

372
1541
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,900
So childish!

373
1545
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,200
So what if I'm childish?

374
1549
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,500
So what if I'm childish when we're together? 
 Hurry up and say it.

375
1554
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:40,500
-I'm not going to.  I can't.

376
1558
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Why not?

377
1562
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
I've never done it before.

378
1566
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,500
Why are you so shocked?

379
1570
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,600
You haven't even said it to Hee Jin?

380
1574
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,200
Yeah.

381
1578
00:32:55,831 --> 00:32:57,285
Really?

382
1582
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,727
Yes!

383
1586
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,342
Then, what about Mi Joo?

384
1590
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:01,855
Mi Joo is my family.

385
1594
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,900
Who cares if she's family? 
 You would have at least said it to Mi Joo.

386
1599
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,400
I've never done it.

387
1603
00:33:08,658 --> 00:33:12,543
You're...mental, aren't you?

388
1607
00:33:12,543 --> 00:33:15,021
There's no need to say things like that.

389
1611
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:19,369
How is it possible to not say 'I love you' once after you were born?

390
1615
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:21,215
Are you human?

391
1619
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,800
Then, what about you?

392
1623
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,100
I've said it probably thousands of times.

393
1627
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,100
You mean to Min Hyun Woo?

394
1631
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,300
Do you think I can only say that to men?

395
1635
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,400
Family, friends...

396
1639
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:41,508
It's customary to say, "I love you" to them often.

397
1643
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,000
Why?  Your feeling should be enough.

398
1647
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:48,681
You have to openly say, "I love you."

399
1651
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:51,370
Who's going to know if you keep it in your heart? Huh?

400
1655
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,901
What's the difference between saying it and knowing from your heart?

401
1659
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,500
It's very different. No matter how much you adore that person, they'll want to hear you say it.

402
1663
00:34:03,114 --> 00:34:04,698
It's so childish.

403
1667
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,800
We were born to be childish.

404
1671
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,900
But, now isn't the time to discuss matters like this, don't you think?

405
1675
00:34:13,386 --> 00:34:20,153
Today, I'm going to definitely cure this illness you've had for 27 years.

406
1679
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:21,474
Hurry up and tell me you love me.

407
1683
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:22,838
Let go!

408
1687
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:24,437
Hurry up and just tell me you love me!

409
1691
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,896
Hurry up and let go!

410
1695
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:29,606
If I don't do this, I don't think I can cure this illness of yours.

411
1699
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:30,976
Now, say it now.

412
1703
00:34:30,976 --> 00:34:32,448
I'm getting angry!

413
1707
00:34:32,448 --> 00:34:34,296
Hurry up!

414
1711
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,200
Just once! Hurry up and say it!

415
1715
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:39,394
I love you!

416
1719
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:41,720
-Louder! 
- I said I love you!

417
1724
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,997
Louder!  One more time!

418
1728
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:45,990
I love you!

419
1732
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,800
Why does a woman have so much strength?

420
1736
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,100
Is that all?

421
1740
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,900
I'm...going to let this go for tonight.

422
1744
00:35:03,975 --> 00:35:05,479
But, next time...

423
1748
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:12,700
You're going to seriously say, "I love you" to me from the bottom of your heart.

424
1752
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,300
Alright?

425
1756
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,000
You've wasted so much strength.

426
1760
00:35:23,277 --> 00:35:24,696
Wait!

427
1764
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
What now?

428
1768
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,000
What if I really get pregnant from this?

429
1772
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,900
Do you have one?

430
1776
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,000
No.

431
1780
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:46,335
Hurry up and go buy some.

432
1784
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:48,829
Where would I buy them at this time of night?

433
1788
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:51,062
There's a convenient store just down the street.Hurry up and go buy some.

434
1792
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,000
How can I?

435
1796
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:57,355
How can I wear a wedding dress with a bulging stomach?

436
1800
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,500
You look pregnant even without the bulging stomach!

437
1804
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:07,699
Even now... Hurry up and go.

438
1808
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,997
Just go get them. Now!

439
1812
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,970
Hurry up.

440
1816
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,040
Hurry up and get going.

441
1820
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,000
See you soon, darling!

442
1824
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,600
Come back quickly, darling!

443
1828
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,080
♬<i>After receiving it he will look at a toy and</i>♬

444
1832
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:41,020
♬<i>hug it and surely destroy it. </i>♬

445
1836
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:45,860

446
1840
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:50,080
♬<i> like a child the people who gave it.</i>♬

447
1844
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,500
Do you..not have any?

448
1848
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:55,842
You know...those things...

449
1852
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,300
I'm not understanding.  What are you looking for?

450
1856
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,800
Nevermind.

♬<i> My Beautiful Person </i>♬

458
1888
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:57,320
Sam Sook, you-You saw everything, didn't you?

459
1892
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,000
You jerk... You quiet jerk...

460
1896
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,700
Don't look!

461
1900
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,500
What's with the number?

462
1904
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,000
-Hello? 
<i>- It's me, Yoo Hee Jin. </i>

463
1909
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,300
H-Hello?

464
1913
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,411
It's been a while.  <i> Where are you right now? </i>

465
1917
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,400
I'm in America.

466
1921
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,100
But, why are you calling?

467
1925
00:38:44,136 --> 00:38:46,123
I...heard you opened up a shop.

468
1929
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,900
<i> Yes. </i>

469
1933
00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:49,690
Is it doing well?

470
1937
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:55,000
It's...still in the process of paying for our flour bill.

471
1941
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
<i> I'm sure it'll do well. </i>

472
1945
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,900
I guess so.

473
1949
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,800
Why did you call?

474
1953
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,700
<i> I wanted to thank you. </i>

475
1957
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:16,706
For the porridge  then ...

476
1961
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:19,323
and also for sending Jin Hun to America.

477
1965
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:28,100
It's...not like any of it was a big deal..

478
1969
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:33,481
<i> Are you eating well? </i>

479
1973
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,200
Yes.

480
1977
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,000
You have to eat regularly. There's nothing more important than your health.

481
1981
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,500
Yes.

482
1985
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:47,137
Henry... Is Henry doing well?

483
1989
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,891
Yes.

484
1993
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,400
<i> Are you...not curious about Jin Hun? </i>

485
1997
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,600
I have no time for that.

486
2001
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,900
You... will probably become a great doctor.

487
2005
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,700
Why do you think so?

488
2009
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:17,200
Because...someone who has suffered, will understand those who are suffering now.

489
2013
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
Thank you.

490
2017
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,800
Hee Jin...

491
2021
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:36,000
I would like it if you didn't call me again.

492
2025
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:41,100
I don't care for you very much.

493
2029
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,531
I feel the same way.

494
2033
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:47,205
I have no need to call again.

495
2037
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:49,510
Or to meet up.

496
2041
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
<i> I'll hang up now. </i>

497
2045
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,100
It will be 3500 won.

498
2049
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,442
Excuse me! What about your change?

499
2053
00:41:31,442 --> 00:41:32,725
What's wrong with that mister?

500
2057
00:41:32,725 --> 00:41:35,681
Even so...he was really good-looking. 
 Wasn't he?

501
2062
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
Yeah.

502
2066
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,510
Oh, you came?

503
2070
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,511
You've been waiting long?

504
2074
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,900
No.  I've been studying.

505
2078
00:41:56,612 --> 00:42:00,313
I've got good news, and bad news. 
 Which one do you want to hear first?

506
2083
00:42:00,313 --> 00:42:03,113
The good news!  You know me.

507
2087
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,615
The good news is that... I get to do what I've always wanted to do.

508
2091
00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:09,716
And that is?

509
2095
00:42:09,716 --> 00:42:17,517
I get to work with MSF.  I get to give food and medicine to children and people who need it.

510
2099
00:42:17,517 --> 00:42:19,000
Things like that.

511
2103
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:25,618
But... 2 years in Africa, that's the bad news.

512
2107
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,400
2 years?

513
2111
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:37,221
And you have to go do this?

514
2115
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,722
Well, it's what I've always wanted to do.

515
2119
00:42:42,223 --> 00:42:44,324
Can't you wait?

516
2123
00:42:44,324 --> 00:42:45,325
Wait?

517
2127
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,100
Wait until I've finished my studies, and I become a doctor. Then we can do this together.

518
2131
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,200
Can't we?

519
2135
00:42:58,512 --> 00:43:01,508
Study!  Quickly, quickly!  Study!

520
2139
00:43:01,508 --> 00:43:03,400
Really?

521
2143
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,244
If we're going to wait, you have to study.

522
2147
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:07,192
Okay!  Promise!

523
2151
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:23,640
♬<i> My precious beloved take my hand.</i>♬

524
2155
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:39,110
♬ <i> Because your coming  to me again, is like a beautiful flower song</i>♬

525
2159
00:43:42,293 --> 00:43:45,089
You think it's funny that I kissed you, huh?

526
2163
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,700
Sit down.  I have to study.

527
2167
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,800
Honey, I"m back!

528
2171
00:43:59,629 --> 00:44:06,034
Honey. Honey!  Wake up!  Sam Soon! 
 Sam Soon!

529
2176
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:09,263
Just leave me alone!

530
2180
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,500
Wake up!  You're just going to sleep?

531
2184
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,200
Do you know that feeling?

532
2188
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,900
When I was on a train...and the sun was setting...

533
2192
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,700
There wasn't a place for me to sleep... and I knew no one...

534
2196
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,400
I was very lonely.  And I cried like crazy.

535
2200
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,000
At that time, I thought of you.

536
2204
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,800
I'm not going to travel alone anymore.

537
2208
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:09,700
But...how are we going to persuade President Na?

538
2212
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,400
You said...your name is Sam Soon?

539
2216
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,874
Yes.

540
2220
00:45:29,874 --> 00:45:32,020
Then are you the third daughter?

541
2224
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,413
Yes.

542
2228
00:45:33,413 --> 00:45:35,090
How old are you?

543
2232
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,100
Yes... I'm 30 years-old.

544
2236
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,953
And how old are you?

545
2240
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,600
I'm 27 years-old.

546
2244
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:43,839
Then...

547
2248
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,761
Dating younger people is the trend nowadays.

548
2252
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:47,431
Trend?

549
2256
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:49,586
Then, do you dig older woman?

550
2260
00:45:49,586 --> 00:45:50,655
Yes.

551
2264
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,800
Then, should I follow the trend and start dating older women, too?

552
2268
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,700
Fine.  What do your parents do for a living?

553
2272
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,742
Her father passed away.

554
2276
00:46:05,742 --> 00:46:10,678
Then... What did he do before?

555
2280
00:46:10,678 --> 00:46:14,100
He worked in the food industry.

556
2284
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,000
Food industry?

557
2288
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:19,788
I know the food industry well.  What business did he run?

558
2292
00:46:19,788 --> 00:46:21,909
Yes.  He ran the Sam Soon-

559
2296
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:23,678
He was a miller.

560
2300
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,600
Miller?

561
2304
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:33,100
Yes, a miller.  The company was taken over by close acquaintances.

562
2308
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,400
And my mother runs a small-scale business.

563
2312
00:46:38,413 --> 00:46:41,144
Wait...if that's the case then-

564
2316
00:46:41,144 --> 00:46:43,299
She's a moneylender.

565
2320
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:44,572
Moneylender?

566
2324
00:46:44,572 --> 00:46:47,906
Yes. Very small-time.

567
2328
00:46:49,882 --> 00:46:54,448
Is that so? 
So...you make cakes for a living?

568
2333
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:56,807
Yes.

569
2337
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,300
So, I see.

570
2341
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,800
- So, what do you like about our Jin Hun?
 - Pardon?

571
2346
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,000
What do you like about our Jin Hun to ask about marriage?

572
2350
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,600
I love everything.

573
2354
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,700
Everything...

574
2358
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,300
Fine. You would love everything.

575
2362
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,500
Little Auntie!

576
2366
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,900
Oh, Mi Joo, you're here! 
 Have you been well?

577
2371
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:40,885
-LIttle Auntie...
-Yes? 
- When will you make more cookies?

578
2377
00:47:40,885 --> 00:47:44,555
I can make cookies any time.

579
2381
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,500
And this little auntie opened a new shop.

580
2385
00:47:48,341 --> 00:47:50,238
Then, please make some tomorrow.

581
2389
00:47:50,238 --> 00:47:52,551
You want me to make some tomorrow?

582
2393
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:57,112
Bring Mi Joo with you tomorrow, okay?

583
2397
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,600
Jin Hun, come speak with me.

584
2401
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,133
This won't do.

585
2405
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:19,167
I understand her methods of using Mi Joo..

586
2409
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:20,966
Sam Soon won't do.

587
2413
00:48:20,966 --> 00:48:24,777
I'm handing over the restaurant to Manager Oh and Chef Lee.

588
2417
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:25,650
What?

589
2421
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,566
I'm planning on going into the hotel.

590
2425
00:48:27,566 --> 00:48:28,714
What did you say?

591
2429
00:48:28,714 --> 00:48:31,205
It was your wish for me to work in the hotel.

592
2433
00:48:31,205 --> 00:48:33,389
I'll fulfill that wish. 
 However..

593
2438
00:48:33,389 --> 00:48:35,404
You have to accept my marriage with Sam Soon.

594
2442
00:48:35,404 --> 00:48:40,152
Are you negotiating with me for a matter of marriage?

595
2446
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,800
- She's pregnant. <b> - Huh?</b>

596
2450
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,500
She's pregnant.

597
2454
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,600
Fine.  Let's go to the gynecologist together tomorrow.

598
2458
00:48:56,346 --> 00:49:00,749
I know Doctor Kim. She's a gynecologist.

599
2462
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:07,400
Of course...she's a gynecologist... Wonderful...I guess we have to go.

600
2466
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,800
Sam Soon...

601
2470
00:49:17,272 --> 00:49:18,395
What?

602
2474
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,500
We have to make a baby.

603
2478
00:49:20,537 --> 00:49:24,280
What?  What's wrong with you?  I don't want to!

604
2482
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,403
I don't want to wear a wedding dress with a bulging stomach!

605
2486
00:49:26,403 --> 00:49:28,792
It's not going to matter if you can't fit into a wedding dress.

606
2490
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:32,794
It matters to me whether or not I wear one. 
 I don't want to do this if I do wear a wedding dress!

607
2495
00:49:32,794 --> 00:49:34,517
You'll look pretty any way.  Don't worry about it.

608
2499
00:49:34,517 --> 00:49:37,766
-I don't want to. 
-Be good and follow me!

609
2504
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,829
I really don't want to do this!

610
2508
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:43,731
I said I don't want to do this!

611
2512
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,700
Honey... It's night time.

612
2516
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,300
- Will the grandmother of the mountains (Korean fairy for pregnancy) visit us tonight? 
 - Yeah.

613
2521
00:50:19,482 --> 00:50:22,490
What do we do if I don't get pregnant?

614
2525
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,100
I'm leaving.

615
2529
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,500
Bad girl...

616
2533
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,000
When are you coming back?

617
2537
00:50:53,494 --> 00:50:55,634
Are you really going to take 2-3 years?

618
2541
00:50:55,634 --> 00:50:58,889
I plan on staying there if I find a decent man.

619
2545
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,329
If you were looking for a man, then you would've already gotten married by now.

620
2549
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,700
Who knows...Maybe I'll find the man I've been looking for. 
 I'll be going now.

621
2554
00:51:09,755 --> 00:51:12,308
You disrespectful child.... You dare to leave me?!

622
2558
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:15,241
Why are you hitting me?  It hurts.

623
2562
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:17,425
If you were taking a plane, you should have booked a morning flight.

624
2566
00:51:17,425 --> 00:51:19,106
Why did you take an evening flight?

625
2570
00:51:19,106 --> 00:51:21,026
Evening flights are cheaper.

626
2574
00:51:21,026 --> 00:51:24,351
Why are you taking the cheaper flight? Did I give you a low salary?

627
2578
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,400
Why are you making things difficult?

628
2582
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,200
You bad child...

629
2586
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:37,596
I'll come back if I find myself a man.

630
2590
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,600
There's no need.  See if I care if you come back or not.

631
2594
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,100
I'm really going now.

632
2598
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,400
At least call often.

633
2602
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,300
Yes.

634
2606
00:52:02,629 --> 00:52:04,623
Auntie, where are you going?

635
2610
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:07,110
I'm going somewhere wonderful.

636
2614
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:08,429
When are you coming back?

637
2618
00:52:10,022 --> 00:52:11,985
When Mi Joo enters school.

638
2622
00:52:11,985 --> 00:52:13,495
Really?

639
2626
00:52:13,495 --> 00:52:18,320
Of course.  Until then,  You have to listen to your grandmother well.

640
2630
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,800
Yes.

641
2634
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,400
Dad!

642
2638
00:53:13,465 --> 00:53:16,886
What brings you here? 
 Why are you doing this in someone else's apartment?

643
2643
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,300
It's fine. It's only a dream.

644
2647
00:53:19,368 --> 00:53:23,202
Ah, that's right!  It's only a dream.

645
2651
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,300
Why are you at someone else's house?  It's embarassing.

646
2655
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,500
Do you like him?

647
2659
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,100
Are you happy?

648
2663
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,900
Yes, Dad.

649
2667
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,879
Then, you don't need anything else in life.

650
2671
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,800
Living with the person you love will be enough.

651
2675
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:52,236
What about you, Dad?

652
2679
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,400
Are you happy?

653
2683
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,500
It's not bad being dead.

654
2687
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:05,814
I'm happy that you're happy.

655
2691
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,500
You said you were happy.  What's wrong?

656
2695
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,700
I'm so happy.

657
2699
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,300
Because I'm so happy...

658
2703
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,100
But...

659
2707
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,800
I'm terrified to see this break...

660
2711
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,000
Sam Soon.

661
2715
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:09,188
I'm absolutely terrified to see this break, Dad.

662
2719
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:18,100
You dummy...You don't know whether or not it's going to work out, so why are you getting so worried now?

663
2723
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:21,185
You're right.

664
2727
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:22,876
Of course.

665
2731
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:25,013
You're busy living a happy life,

666
2735
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,300
so why are you wasting your time worrying?

667
2739
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,859
You're right.

668
2743
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,300
Don't stay in the past... And don't think about the future...

669
2747
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,500
Just live life to the fullest every day.

670
2751
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,700
You're right.

671
2755
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:53,200
My third daughter... Don't cry and live well.

672
2759
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,700
Yes, Dad.

673
2763
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,000
Fighting!

674
2767
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,200
Fighting!

675
2771
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,700
Fighting!

676
2775
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:13,960
♬<i>Inside my heart </i>♬

677
2779
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,220
♬<i> I know what is there</i>♬

678
2783
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:23,870
♬<i> I, who am waiting for  the sunset in the sky </i>♬

679
2787
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:27,610
♬<i>Inside your heart </i>♬

680
2791
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:33,020
♬<i> I am now waiting for you </i> ♬

681
2795
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,700
♬<i> Yearning for you, I am crying. </i>♬

682
2799
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:43,100
<i>That night the three goddesses of childbirth blessed us with triplets. We got married.</i>

683
2803
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,400
<i> Mountains, land, and sea...</i>

684
2807
00:56:46,412 --> 00:56:48,500
<i> Those were our children's names. </i>

685
2811
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:53,200
<i> No...this was my dream. </i>

686
2815
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,300
<i> This was also my dream. </i>

687
2819
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:18,400
<i> However...I'm still waiting for the day when these dreams come true. </i>

688
2823
00:57:28,405 --> 00:57:31,919
<i> But, I did manage to make one small wish come true. </i>

689
2827
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,900
<i> And that was to play the piano for him. </i>

690
2831
00:59:15,476 --> 00:59:18,843
<i> That night, the three goddesses of childbirth  didn't bless us. </i>

691
2835
00:59:18,843 --> 00:59:21,299
<i> And mother-in-law was still against our marriage. </i>

692
2839
00:59:28,328 --> 00:59:31,334
<i> However, we're still loving each other. </i>

693
2843
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,408
We constantly argue, forgive each other,

694
2847
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:37,175
laugh, and cry... whenever we're together.

695
2851
00:59:47,078 --> 00:59:50,525
<i> Every so often, I think about that...</i>

696
2855
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:54,177
<i> Even we...have a chance of breaking up. </i>

697
2859
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:55,774
<i> Since that's what being in love is all about. </i>

698
2863
00:59:57,005 --> 00:59:59,628
<i> However, I have nothing to worry about at this moment.</i>

699
2867
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,082
<i> I now understand what I have to do. </i>

700
2871
01:00:06,082 --> 01:00:10,284
<i> Work hard on baking cakes... And love unconditionally...</i>

701
2875
01:00:10,284 --> 01:00:12,530
<i> Like there's no tomorrow... </i>

702
2879
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,525
<i> Like I've never been hurt before. </i>

703
2883
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,003
<i> Like how I, Kim Sam Soon, have loved myself. </i>

704
2887
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:36,540
♬<i> I'll give you all my shy feelings which have been hidden </i>♬

705
2891
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:46,740
♬<i> Your smile which could move me who am cold </i>♬

706
2895
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:56,680
♬<i> My stubborn dark feelings will all open for  you </i> ♬

707
2899
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:07,160
♬<i> ♬ Your love which gives meaning to terrible me. </i>♬

708
2903
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:16,690
♬ <i> At first when I didn't know, only your scent was sensed </i> ♬

709
2907
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:24,330
♬ <i> The more time passed, the more I changed  </i>♬

710
2911
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:36,980
♬<i> I'll give you all my shy feelings which have been hidden </i>♬

711
2915
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:48,500

712
2919
01:01:50,560 --> 01:02:04,410
♬<i>Your smile has given warmth to cold me. </i>♬
