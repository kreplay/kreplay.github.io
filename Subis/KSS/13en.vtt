<i>My Lovely Sam Soon</i>

00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,356
<i> Episode 13: How to say goodbye to her...</i>

3
11
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,800
I am Kim Hee Jin!

4
15
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,000
Not Sam Soon, but Kim Hee Jin!

5
19
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,200
Sam Shik! Sam Shik!

6
23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,600
From now on... from now on, everything is over!

7
27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
According to whom?

8
31
00:00:58,347 --> 00:01:00,941
Wonderful! I am also hallucinating!

9
35
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:07,264
No, no! Until I am off this mountain I can't lose my mind! Come on Sam Soon!

10
39
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,500
I mean Hee JIn... Come on, keep it together!

11
43
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,389
Who gave permission to change your name to Kim Hee Jin?

12
47
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,500
Didn't I tell you that I liked Sam Soon?

13
51
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,300
Come on, let's go down. I am hungry.

14
55
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
You jerk...

15
59
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:31,823
Since I am used to this, I'm not surprised that you gave me a nickname.

16
63
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,215
I am also used to this.

17
67
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,100
You destroyed my dreams.

18
71
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,450
We have to rewrite our contract.

19
75
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,284
Hyun Jin Hun and Kim Sam Soon are pretending  to date for 100 years.

20
79
00:01:52,284 --> 00:01:53,468
Stop joking.

21
83
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:55,580
Physical contact is allowed.

22
87
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,619
Announce it to the world, why don't you?

23
91
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:02,313
And Hyun Jin Hun is going to lend 1 million dollars to Kim Sam Soon.

24
95
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:05,726
Steadly over the course of 100 years.

25
99
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:09,271
Now you're trying to buy me with 10 million dollars instead of 50 thousand dollars?

26
103
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:11,182
You can pay me back if you'd like to.

27
107
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:14,382
Are you thinking that, when you give me that much money, I will run to you?

28
111
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,715
Let me go. Aren't you going to let go of this?

29
115
00:02:18,715 --> 00:02:21,094
Let's go down before the sun sets.

30
119
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,421
Aren't you coming?

31
123
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,500
Give me something to eat... I am dying from hunger.

32
127
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:47,523
Are you a child? 
Who brings choco-pies while mountain hiking?

33
132
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:50,476
Choco-pies taste the best when you're on top of a mountain.

34
136
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,360
Because I am eating your choco-pies it doesn't mean that I am going to sign your stupid contract!

35
140
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,800
Not even in your dreams, do you understand?

36
144
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,090
Once we get down, it's goodbye, okay?

37
148
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:11,482
What is this for?

38
152
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,158
Today is your birthday.

39
156
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:19,149
How did you know?

40
160
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,500
Your sister told me.

41
164
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:33,051
This is sea urchin seaweed soup ...

42
168
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:35,236
Because we are on Jeju Island.

43
172
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:42,781
You are impressed, aren't you?

44
176
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:52,964
This doesn't mean I am signing your stupid contract.

45
180
00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:58,680
I am going to eat this seaweed soup to lighten your backpack when we are going down.

46
184
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Even if you eat a lot of it, it'll be of use later.

47
188
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:09,538
What?

48
192
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,400
Ahh, ahh, it hurts...

49
196
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:32,488
Be more gentle, you are hurting me!

50
200
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,068
Stay still.

51
204
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:38,012
It's really hurting. Be more gentle!

52
208
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,923
Stop grumbling and have more patience.

53
212
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,500
It's really painful!

54
216
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:55,399
Are you okay?

55
220
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,938
I am not.

56
224
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,600
Lay down, I will massage your leg.

57
228
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,272
My pain is bearable.

58
232
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,310
You shouldn't have climbed the mountain. Why didn't you wait?

59
236
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,466
Because you are Kim Sam Soon.

60
240
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,600
If you were Kim Hee Jin, I wouldn't have come.

61
244
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,160
But my lovely Kim Sam Soon climbed there for me.

62
248
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,333
The least I can do is this.

63
252
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:29,400
You are really impressive.

64
256
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:33,049
You are really an impressive man.

65
260
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:38,721
It may be all impressive now...
 but, how did you do it before with your injured leg?

66
265
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:42,714
Because at least I am not dead.

67
269
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,120
Whenever something difficult occurred in life,

68
273
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,817
I always said to myself, "At least it won't kill you."

69
277
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,400
What are you doing? 
 You're having dirty thoughts right now, aren't you?

70
282
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:14,200
Did you forget what our contract said?

71
286
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,600
"Skinship" is acceptable.

72
290
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,000
My leg!

73
294
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:24,746
No!

74
298
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:26,059
Don't play hard to get.

75
302
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:29,791
I'm not playing hard to get.  I just have a reason.

76
306
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,184
What's that?

77
310
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:32,848
Wait until I lose some weight.

78
314
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:33,795
What?

79
318
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,400
10 kilos...  No...If I lose 5 kilos...

80
322
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:44,537
Then I'll accept it. Until then, you have to wait.

81
326
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,951
Are you kidding me right now?

82
330
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,700
This is very important to me.

83
334
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:55,720
I'm going to lose the weight, get a massage, and until I say, "Hey, I look good,"

84
338
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,970
you'll just have to wait.

85
342
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,300
No way. I can't wait.

86
346
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,400
Oh -- that's right!

87
350
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,400
I almost forgot the most important thing. Wait here.

88
354
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:08,483
What's more important than this right now?

89
358
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,700
Ah! Just wait a bit!

90
362
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:31,512
I'm not a human being if I ever hike up that mountain again.

91
366
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:36,444
This wasn't supposed to get wet...

92
370
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:41,733
What is it?

93
374
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,692
It's my name change application.

94
378
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,000
It got wet! What to do?

95
382
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,300
What are you doing?! 
 It has to dry! I have to hand it in!

96
387
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:59,801
Who said you could change your name?

97
391
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:11,900
Hey! Do you know how I've lived for 30 years?! How could
you do this to me, you crazy bastard?!  Die, die die!

98
396
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,960
You bast***!. How could you?

99
400
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,300
There are more important things than that...

100
404
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:30,100
Hey ... do you know what happens to someone who crosses me?

101
408
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,600
I'm going to give you a black eye so get off of me right now!

102
412
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,620
You trash!  Using a bowlful of seaweed soup to soften me up?

103
416
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,050
Jokester! Get off of that!

104
420
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:45,889
-You bastard!
 -Why are you so strong?!

105
425
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,820
Hey you bast***!

106
429
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Where did he go?

107
433
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,700
Sam Shik!

108
437
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:07,354
You're bleeding.

109
441
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:09,093
What should I do ...

110
445
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,900
Remove your hand.

111
449
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:20,912
Get down.

112
453
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:26,283
Can't we just hug each other and sleep?

113
457
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:33,200
I would have allowed it... if you hadn't ripped up my application.

114
461
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,900
But, I can't forgive you for that.

115
465
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:42,650
Are you not going to get down?

116
469
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:47,964
I won't touch you. So selfish...

117
473
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:53,581
I'm afraid I'm going to give in.

118
477
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know if I can control it.

119
481
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:08,142
I'll give you a lot of pleasure.

120
485
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:14,688
When I lose weight.

121
489
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:17,252
How long do I have to wait?

122
493
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:18,445
One month?

123
497
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,200
One month may be too short...

124
501
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Maybe two months?

125
505
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Don't be like that... This very deprived old woman here ...

126
509
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,820
has bloody tears.

127
513
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:51,040
♫<i>Something is happening to me<i>♫</i></i>

128
517
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:59,350
♫<i> What form will it take to shake me up?</i>♫

129
521
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:09,380
♫<i>But it seems it can't happen two times again.</i>♫

130
525
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:20,470
♫<i> Surely now it's not the case you came looking for me.</i>♫

131
529
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:29,140
♫<i> I've been looking forward for a long time. </i>♫

132
533
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,300
Welcome to my place.

133
537
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,980
I have a lot of rooms there.

134
541
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,810
Yeah. It looks like it.

135
545
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,140
Goo  ... Gook Bo ... [National Treasure]

136
549
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,840
Gook Bo gae I baek i ship yook ho.

137
553
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,940
Gae i baek i sip yook ho.

138
557
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,730
Good. It means it's like the 226th National Treasure in Korea.

139
561
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:36,970
It looks like this is the place where the royal servants bowed to the king on the New Year's Day.

140
565
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,250
I don't know how do you say king around here?

141
569
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,040
Really?  "Hwang"

142
573
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,670
--Hwang.
--Hwang.

143
578
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,550
Ingom ... That's hard.

144
582
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,380
Imgeumnim. Imgeumnim.  Oh, so hard!

145
586
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,420
Imgoomnim. That's too difficult.

146
590
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,580
No it's not. It's easy Imgeumnim.

147
594
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,360
Imgumnim.

148
598
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,040
Imgumnim.

149
602
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:06,638
What? Jin Hyun went to Jeju Island with a girl?

150
606
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,200
He checked in last night. And he just checked out today.

151
610
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:13,624
Who's the girl? Hee Jin?

152
614
00:14:13,624 --> 00:14:16,810
I don't think it's Hee Jin.

153
618
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,246
She was tall and chubby...  It's got to be Sam Soon.

154
622
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:23,338
What?!  Sam Soon?!

155
626
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:28,177
Why is this kid confusing everybody?! 
 First it's Hee Jin, and now it's Sam Soon?!

156
631
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:30,164
I guess so...

157
635
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:36,088
This child... I'm going to... What did he say? 
 Did you hear anything from the restaurant?

158
640
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:38,888
He got caught before.   He said he wouldn't do it again.

159
644
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,300
Then why would he say it if he wouldn't do it again?!

160
648
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,628
But President... What will happen if they really are dating?

161
652
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:50,827
Don't even say something so awful!

162
656
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,800
You're coming back to work tomorrow, right?

163
660
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:58,053
Why should I?

164
664
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,800
What? Wasn't it obvious?

165
668
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,298
My work is my work, yours is yours.

166
672
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,500
I'm going to open a shop with my sister.

167
676
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,868
Shop?

168
680
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:11,448
We're going to open an online shop, and if it does well, we'll open a real one.

169
684
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:13,475
What about me? What am I supposed to do?

170
688
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:16,227
Why are you asking me?  What you do is your own business.

171
692
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:18,747
Are you really going to be this selfish?

172
696
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:25,426
You didn't come for the woman Kim Sam Soon, but the patissier, Kim Sam Soon, didn't you?

173
700
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:26,990
Both.

174
704
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,100
Anyway, I knew you were up to something after giving me seaweed soup and  coming  around.

175
708
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:40,362
So, who was the X-Man?  I'm dying to know.

176
712
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,500
I don't know.  I'm not going to tell you.

177
716
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,200
Acting all sulky ... Who is it? Tell me.

178
720
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,500
Acting like a sore loser ... Tell me.

179
724
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,910
Do you want me to do it again?

180
728
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:04,144
Okay!  Okay! I'll tell you!

181
732
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,720
Who was it?

182
736
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,204
<i> Quickly bring some toilet paper. </i>

183
740
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:29,957
<i> You're a blood type B, aren't you? 
 Merong! </i>

184
745
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:40,775
<i>It's me...</i>

185
749
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,900
<i>It seems...  like Sam Soon is going to quit.</i>

186
753
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,800
<i>I don't know what the reason is.</i>

187
757
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,400
<i>But, it seems as though she got into a fight with the President...</i>

188
761
00:16:54,443 --> 00:16:57,126
Who was it? Ah, who was it?

189
765
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,600
If you come to work, I'll tell you.

190
769
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
If you don't tell me here, I'll make a big commotion.

191
773
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:09,053
The person was...

192
777
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:12,393
<i> You should hang up the phone. </i>

193
781
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:15,720
<i>I said hang up the phone!</i>

194
785
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:26,328
<i>I really want to fire you right now...
 But, I'm going to let this go once.</i>

195
790
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:28,377
<i>Instead ...</i>

196
794
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:31,454
<i>Give me some toilet paper. </i>

197
798
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:32,764
<i>Hurry!</i>

198
802
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:35,012
<i> Ki Bang? </i>

199
806
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Ki Bang... That bastard...

200
810
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:45,942
Wow... I was nice to him because he got
 picked on, and this is the thanks I get?

201
815
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:48,412
I told you, so are you going come to work now?

202
819
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:53,287
I didn't sign that contract, so don't even think about it.

203
823
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:55,619
But in bed ...

204
827
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:57,719
Were we putting on an act?

205
831
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,941
You didn't end it with her yet.

206
835
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:15,092
Until you break it off...
Dont expect me to wait.

207
840
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,660
We dont have any relationship yet.

208
844
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,510
♫<i> I am searching this way. </i>♫

209

876
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,600
--Still not answering?
--No.

217
881
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,800
I wouldn't worry too much.  He's probably busy.

218
885
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,400
It's annoying though.

219
889
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,060
It feels like a glucose injection is leaking from my body.

220
893
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,950
Oh. I don't think I can help you there.

221
897
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,940
Actually, there is something you can help me with.

222
901
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,570
Go get some golden carp for me.

223
905
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,020
--What?
--Seriously.

224
910
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,600
--They are  meant to be good for women.
 --What? Are you serious?

225
915
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,200
--Really.
--Really?

226
920
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,980
Quickly. Quickly.

227
924
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,550
You can get some in Korea.

228
928
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,200
--You're allowed to.  Don't worry about it. Go. Go.
--All right.

229
933
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,140
Hey!  Stop! Stop! I was just kidding!

230
937
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,720
I was just kidding!

231
941
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,163
So? 
 What did you do there?

232
946
00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:38,194
What are you curious about?

233
950
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:40,025
Did you sleep with him?

234
954
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:41,559
Yeah.

235
958
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,754
Hey! Do you think I accept your relationship?

236
962
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:47,509
How could you rush into things?!

237
966
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:50,400
Geez ... not sex.

238
970
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,900
We just slept. We just slept.

239
974
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,800
What?

240
978
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,400
Do you know how much I sufered that night suppressing my craving for him?

241
982
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,125
And I pinched my leg lying in the same bed all night.

242
986
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:07,060
-Want to see? See, right here.

243
990
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,570
Forget it. Forget it.

244
994
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Anyway... I'm still against him. I don't like him.

245
998
00:21:13,645 --> 00:21:16,786
Then why did you tell him?
 Because you told him my birthday.

246
1003
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,900
I told him because it was better than spending your 30th birthday alone.

247
1007
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,200
So what about Yoo Hee Jin?

248
1011
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:33,847
-See, see? 
-I knew there was black in his eyes.

249
1016
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:37,563
White or black, don't butt into my business in the future.

250
1020
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm going to work things out for myself.

251
1024
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:46,426
See , the unlucky hunter who catches a bear still doesn't become courageous.  So pitiful!

252
1028
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:47,651
You think I'm talking about you?

253
1032
00:21:48,702 --> 00:21:51,300
Geez! 
 Ow!

254
1037
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,600
I told you not to touch that leg!

255
1041
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,057
Going up Mount Hallyu was the biggest regret in my life.

256
1045
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,900
Wash my clothing too.

257
1049
00:22:13,424 --> 00:22:15,456
Hello, President.

258
1053
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:23,828
What is going on?

259
1057
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:25,400
You came back from Jeju Island?

260
1061
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,033
Did you have an X-Man there too?

261
1065
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:28,875
Who was the girl you went with?

262
1069
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,000
I said who was it?

263
1073
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,405
It was Kim Sam Soon.

264
1077
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:38,855
Is this guy for real? Are you a ping pong ball? 
Confusing everybody while you go back and forth...

265
1082
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,624
It can't be Sam Soon.

266
1086
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:44,213
Then why did you bring her to the temple?

267
1090
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:45,367
To get you away from Hee Jin.

268
1094
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:47,383
Why do you live like this? 
 Aren't you tired?

269
1099
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:50,771
I've set you up on a blind date this week.

270
1103
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:52,883
This time don't make a mistake and do it right.

271
1107
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:55,878
If you don't, I'll ruin this restaurant.

272
1111
00:22:55,878 --> 00:22:58,000
Have you ever seen me listen to you?

273
1115
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,500
This jerk...
Do you want to see me die?!

274
1120
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,330
This President Na?

275
1124
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,700
You have a long life line. 
 Didn't the fortune teller said you'll live to be at least 90 years old?

276
1129
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,500
Looks like someone's temper got the best of them.

277
1133
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,240
Please pay for the damages before leaving.

278
1137
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,514
You better be there on Sunday at 3!

279
1141
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:27,155
Why do you keep chasing a lost cause?

280
1145
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,095
Why are you like this?

281
1149
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:32,142
Find out Sam Soon's address.

282

00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,100
Hey lady, why are you doing this?

305
1248
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,332
It's refreshing.

306
1252
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,168
It's not very refreshing..

307
1256
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Do you lose weight on your back?

308
1260
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,618
How many square feet is it?

309
1264
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:33,519
It's 700 square feet. If you're willing to pay more for the cake shop, you could get another 350 square feet.

310
1268
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,315
If you're going to open a cake shop... then I think you might need a bigger space.

311
1272
00:27:36,315 --> 00:27:40,595
No. Because we're going to open an online shop... 
 There's no need for a big space.

312
1277
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:47,465
Why don't we have a bar by the window-side here? 
 People are going to look through here.

313
1282
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:55,666
We can have the kitchen there.

314
1286
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:59,448
And here... we can add a few tables.

315
1290
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:14,985
Mister...How much is it to rent this place?

316
1294
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:18,042
It's about 50 million won for key money, and 1.2 million won per month.

317
1298
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:22,477
- Thank you. 
 - Wait...

318
1303
00:28:22,477 --> 00:28:23,887
Is it possible to bargain?

319
1307
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:28,855
Don't you think we'll buy the materials cheaper from the place the restaurant  buys from?

320
1311
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:33,200
Forget it. I'll take care of it.

321
1315
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,800
Do you know this place?

322
1319
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,300
Hello!

323
1323
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,912
That fridge, how much is it?

324
1327
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:44,163
I'll sell it to you for cheap.  $1,500.

325
1331
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:47,058
$1500?!

326
1335
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,156
What about that one?

327
1339
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:51,356
That one? 
 $1000.

328
1344
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,700
$1000...

329
1348
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:55,187
Just use the one we have at home.  Makes things easier.

330
1352
00:28:55,187 --> 00:28:56,873
How can we use the one at home? 
 Move over.

331
1357
00:28:56,873 --> 00:28:58,186
How much is this?

332
1361
00:28:58,186 --> 00:28:59,794
I'll give it to you for $750.

333
1365
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:05,365
What about this?

334
1369
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,900
That?  $1000.

335
1373
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:09,177
Hold on a minute...

336
1377
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:14,196
Used ones? Come this way.

337
1381
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:17,261
How much are the used ones?

338
1385
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:21,022
Usually 60% off of the price of the new one.
 And there's one year warranty.

339
1390
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:22,843
- Can we have it 70% off instead of 60%? 
 - Don't worry I'll give it to you cheap.

340
1395
00:29:23,358 --> 00:29:24,731
You'll make it cheap?

341
1399
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:26,465
- I'll give it to you cheap. 
-When we have some gold in our pocket, we'll come here.

342
1404
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:27,840
Come over here.

343
1408
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,764
You're going to pay anyway, so do whatever you want.

344
1412
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,500
You really want to get smacked, don't you?

345
1416
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,000
You're Kim Sam Soon's mother, right?

346
1420
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:41,926
Yes. Who are you and why are you looking for Sam Soon?

347
1424
00:29:41,926 --> 00:29:43,753
ffPlease get in.

348
1428
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,417
Who are you?

349
1432
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:50,930
Please get in for now.

350
1436
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,442
You'll know when you get in.

351
1440
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:54,338
I said who are you?

352
1444
00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:56,182
Who are you to tell me to get in?

353
1448
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,730
But you're not telling me anything except to get in the car.

354
1452
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,200
What kind of person are you? Are you a kidnapper?

355
1456
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:14,531
She is my secretary.

356
1460
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:17,256
I'm this person..

357
1464
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,769
Seoul Hotel President Na? So then?

358
1468
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:26,814
Do you know a man named Hyun Jin Hun?

359
1472
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,900
He runs the Bon Appetit Restaurant.

360
1476
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:33,418
Sam Shik or whatever... that awkward-looking man?

361
1480
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,862
Yes.  I'm his mother.

362
1484
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,100
Then I assume you're the motel owner...

363
1488
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,530
Please excuse me although it's the first time we have met.

364
1492
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,749
Your daughter resembles you.

365
1496
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:51,142
You know my Sam Soon?

366
1500
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:54,470
Actually, I came looking for her.

367
1504
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,911
I don't want to talk in the street, please get in.

368
1508
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:02,039
I don't want to get in the car...
 Why don't you come inside?

369
1513
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:07,200
I don't really want to do that.
 - Then let's talk out here.

370
1518
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,000
Alright.

371
1522
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,700
My Jin Hun already has a bride chosen for him.

372
1526
00:31:25,608 --> 00:31:29,101
They're young, so they must be having an impulsive relationship,

373
1530
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:31,400
Marriage is a big deal.

374
1534
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,582
It's a promise between the two families and...

375
1538
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:37,656
You think I'm going to give him my Sam Soon?

376
1542
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:43,300
I'm sorry, but I won't give my daughter to a man who buys a woman for a few million won.

377
1546
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,900
They aren't a real couple.

378
1550
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,376
Did you say they are not really dating?

379
1554
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:51,883
Jin Hun, come out here!

380
1558
00:31:51,883 --> 00:31:54,757
What? For 50 million won?!

381
1562
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,400
President...  The boss went out.

382
1566
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,300
Where is he?

383
1570
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:44,285
Where on earth did he go?  I'm going to...

384
1574
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:14,390
It's delicious, Mother. Aren't you going to eat?

385
1578
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,449
I ate not too long ago. You just eat a lot.

386
1582
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,100
Alright.

387
1586
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,400
<i> So wasteful... such a beautiful girl...</i>

388
1590
00:33:26,436 --> 00:33:28,851
<i>Should I just accept her as my daughter-in-law?</i>

389
1594
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:33,125
<i>She eats well. She does yoga.</i>

390
1598
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:39,630
<i> Sam Soon looks like a pumpkin in comparison to her. 
 So disappointing...</i>

391
1603
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,700
<i> My goodness...</i>

392
1607
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,600
Are you still doing yoga?

393
1611
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,929
Yes.  I still do it everyday. It's fun.

394
1615
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,400
I see. You really seemed to be the best.

395
1619
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:01,140
Have you seen me do yoga?

396
1623
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,114
See what?

397
1627
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,900
I just heard it. Eat up.

398
1631
00:34:17,392 --> 00:34:19,532
What? Did it go the wrong way?

399
1635
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:24,062
I guess so.

400
1639
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,600
You should eat slower. Why the rush?

401
1643
00:34:31,224 --> 00:34:33,458
I'm going to go to the washroom.

402
1647
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:44,204
That's not right. I can't let it happen.

403
1651
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:47,150
I was very close to being tricked.

404
1655
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,700
What?

405
1659
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,400
Don't be a step behind and think about how to get rid of that Sam Soon girl.

406
1663
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,029
Why are you so eager?

407
1667
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,666
What are you talking about?

408
1671
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:02,345
Just think of a dog biting you.

409
1675
00:35:02,345 --> 00:35:05,263
A dog won't let go until you die.

410
1679
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
You think my Jin Hun is a dog?

411
1683
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:32,392
I should've eaten a little slower.

412
1687
00:35:52,565 --> 00:35:56,059
<i> Hee Jin, Henry, Jin Hun </i>

00:36:13,161 --> 00:36:14,700
You play basketball?

415
1699
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,300
Yeah.

416
1703
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,300
Are you any good?

417
1707
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,800
I'm alright.

418
1711
00:36:19,565 --> 00:36:21,466
How about a game with me?

419
1715
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,600
Sure.

420
1719
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
This won't do.  Let's go somewhere else.

00:41:41,105 --> 00:41:43,450
Is it possible to get it reissued?

455
1859
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,620
Don't let it get reissued, please don't.

456
1863
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:48,734
With my identification? Okay, sure, sure. Thank you.

457
1867
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:50,627
Thank you!

458
1871
00:41:51,234 --> 00:41:53,962
Did you honestly think you were going to stop me?

459
1875
00:41:53,962 --> 00:41:56,683
What a waste... Such a great name...

460
1879
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,151
I told you that I hate the name. 
Samsoon.com – who's going to go on that?

461
1884
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,500
Then you're just going to blatantly go for Hee Jin? Heejin.com?

462
1888
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:06,982
Lets call it 'Momo'.

463
1892
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,183
Momo?

464
1896
00:42:08,183 --> 00:42:10,002
Momo.co.kr.

465
1900
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:11,562
You think that won't exist?

466
1904
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,724
If not that..

467
1908
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:18,853
Momomomo is okay. That is, momo.momo...

468
1912
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:22,300
Although I don't know if any of those exist...My idea is foolproof.

469
1916
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,100
I don't like Samsoon.

470
1920
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,900
How stubborn...

471
1924
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,100
Who's that?

472
1928
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,000
Who is it?

473
1932
00:42:32,018 --> 00:42:33,420
Yes, hello?

474
1936
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,388
Who is it?

475
1940
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,137
I went out right now for a bit.

476
1944
00:42:38,114 --> 00:42:39,750
-Right now? 
- Who is it?

477
1949
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,188
That scared me!

478
1953
00:42:41,188 --> 00:42:43,127
-It's Sam Shik!
- Ah!

479
1958
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,206
My juice!

480
1962
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,000
You called a busy person just to eat Ramen?

481
1966
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,377
Are you busier than I am?

482
1970
00:42:56,377 --> 00:42:58,626
Hurry up and eat before the noodle turns bad.

483
1974
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,832
Just eat since you're out already.

484
1978
00:43:05,484 --> 00:43:09,636
People like me sometimes crave for spicy foods.

485
1982
00:43:10,277 --> 00:43:12,281
What's your reason?

486
1986
00:43:13,613 --> 00:43:15,562
We always meet at night.

487
1990
00:43:15,562 --> 00:43:17,600
I wanted to make sure if your cosmetics give you the looks.

488
1994
00:43:18,745 --> 00:43:22,229
So are you disappointed in seeing me in the afternoon?

489
1998
00:43:24,826 --> 00:43:26,529
Hm, I do see some freckles.

490
2002
00:43:26,529 --> 00:43:27,801
Obviously, considering my age.

491
2006
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:34,301
Yes, I agree. I see what time has done to
your face... freckles, wrinkles. I like them.

492
2011
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:37,095
What on earth do you plan on doing with me?

493
2015
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,500
Let's officially go out.

494
2019
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,700
How many times have we slept together already. Let's try dating.

495
2023
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,394
Look here, Mister Lee Hyun Moo...

496
2027
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:53,086
Just call me honey.

497
2031
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,500
Look...Just because we slept together, you think I'm yours?

498
2035
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:05,532
Don't think you're so special. I don't treat any girls like this.

499
2039
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:08,968
So let's just separate nicely instead of flirting like this.

500
2043
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:13,185
Although you were drunk, you did like me.

501
2047
00:44:13,185 --> 00:44:14,635
Let's not talk informally.

502
2051
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:16,160
If you don't like it, talk informally as well.

503
2055
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,846
You talked informally so well when you were drunk.

504
2059
00:44:18,846 --> 00:44:22,383
And how can a girl be so different at night and at daytime?

505
2063
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:24,755
Are you a goddess at night? 
Do you perform metamorphosis?

506
2068
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Anyway, I don't plan to be involved
with you any longer so don't call me anymore in the future.

507
2073
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:31,533
Can you please let me go?

508
2077
00:44:32,398 --> 00:44:34,100
Then why did you come out here?

509
2081
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:40,026
Did I drag you here? No, you came here on
your own two feet. It's not like you hate me.

510
2086
00:44:40,026 --> 00:44:43,801
I'm sorry to break it to you, but I don't like you.
 I have no feelings for you.

511
2091
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:45,841
Then what? Was this just for fun?

512
2095
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:47,391
That's right.

513
2099
00:44:47,391 --> 00:44:49,460
How can a girl talk so blatantly?

514
2103
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:55,300
Ugh, you piss me off. Why are you such a loser? 
 You're a loser! A loser!

515
2108
00:45:02,384 --> 00:45:04,375
Am I a loser?

516
2112
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,000
What do you think?

517
2116
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,700
Oh no.

518
2120
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,400
Am I loser?

519
2124
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,720
Oh no. Of course not.

520
2128
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,740
Am I low?

521
2132
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,930
You're cool.  You're the king!

522
2136
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,280
Thanks. But don't suck up to me.

523
2140
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,250
Why is it it everytime I see her my heart hurts?  Reality is like that isn't it.

524
2144
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:34,510
I feel for you.  It must be hard to look in a mirror.

525
2148
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,370
Get ready for dinner.

526
2152
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:41,370
A loser!  Really!

527
2156
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,800
Enjoy.

528
2160
00:46:35,824 --> 00:46:38,289
This is how you normally eat it.

529
2164
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,690
Helliya.

530
2168
00:46:51,263 --> 00:46:52,940
What?

531
2172
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,826
You're cute too.

532
2176
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,200
I said you are cute.

533
2180
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,500
I said  you're cute!

534
2184
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Take good care of Hee Jin.  Just like now!

535
2188
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:33,589
This is a perfect diet.  I feel so full even
though I didn't eat anything.

536
2193
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,600
Hey, Kim Sam Soon!

537
2197
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:44,638
How dare you anger me? How are you that great? 
 Are you that great to ruin my marriage?

538
2202
00:47:44,638 --> 00:47:46,530
Why?

539
2206
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,400
Hey, you bitch.

540
2210
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:59,531
Hit me. Hit me. Pull out my hair.

541
2214
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:06,196
It's all because of you. You ruined everything! 
What am I going to do now?!

542
2219
00:48:07,174 --> 00:48:13,500
Hey, Jang Chae Ri! 
I'll tell you this as a life senior.

543
2224
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:17,252
Let's go to the public bath.

544
2228
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:20,837
I'm not going! They're so dirty!

545
2232
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:27,600
How can I go home like this?! 
 Get up now!

546
2237
00:48:38,127 --> 00:48:41,482
Hey.  Do pretty girls like you ever sweat?

547
2241
00:48:41,482 --> 00:48:42,976
Mind your own business.

548
2245
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,100
Are you that in love with Min Hyun Woo? 
 Are you that mad that you guys aren't getting married?

549
2250
00:48:48,153 --> 00:48:49,157
Mind your own business!

550
2254
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,100
How can you speak like that to your Unni...

551
2258
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,980
Don't you have any manners?

552
2262
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,280
Always using your hands!

553
2266
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:04,405
Anyways, Min Hyun Woo isn't the man for you.

554
2270
00:49:04,405 --> 00:49:09,993
He's not a man who can handle a brat like you.

555
2274
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,800
That's why you have to be grateful to me.

556
2278
00:49:13,638 --> 00:49:15,968
Then why did you go out with Hyun Woo?

557
2282
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:23,167
That... well... You think you have eyes when you're in love at a young age?

558
2286
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,700
Being 30 has shown me the big picture.

559
2290
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:29,821
No.  What am I saying is... I can't see anything.

560
2294
00:49:29,821 --> 00:49:32,575
In the end, everyone gets tricked by her own self.

561
2298
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,700
Anyways, I pulled you out from a swamp,
so buy me seaweed soup.

562
2303
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,565
You also hit me multiple times, 
so buy me, Sikhye (a Korean rice beverage).

563
2308
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:48,400
Why do you keep asking your Unni for things when I have no money?

564
2312
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,400
And Sujeonggwa (a Korean fruit punch), too.

565
2316
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,070
Are you fighting back?  You buy everything.

566
2320
00:49:59,728 --> 00:50:01,919
What is that?

567
2324
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,500
Min Hyun Woo?

568
2328
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,442
Who are you?

569
2332
00:50:31,727 --> 00:50:34,400
What are you doing here? Are you drunk?

570
2336
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,000
Sam Soon...

571
2340
00:50:38,653 --> 00:50:40,735
The engagement was broken off.

572
2344
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,600
Drink slowly. You seem to be in shock.

573
2348
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,300
Are you worried?

574
2352
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,618
It was because of that call I made...

575
2356
00:51:03,649 --> 00:51:05,322
Do you feel responsible?

576
2360
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,509
I guess a bit.

577
2364
00:51:21,593 --> 00:51:23,020
What?

578
2368
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,913
--What?
--Sam Soon.

579
2373
00:51:26,913 --> 00:51:30,256
Oscar Wilde once said this,

580
2377
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,800
"Men get married because they're bored. While women get married because they're curious."

581
2381
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,300
I was getting married to Chae Ri because I'm bored.

582
2385
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,800
I love you... Sam Soon.

583
2389
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,600
Sam Soon... I love you!

584
2393
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,700
Do you know what my great mother Park Bong-sook says at a moment like this?

585
2397
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:02,100
Once a cheater,  always a cheater. 
 You got that?

586
2402
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:14,800
Does it hurt? 
Tell me where it hurts. I'll take you to a good hospital.

587
2407
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,100
Sam Soon!

588
2411
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,400
How ridiculous.. Your couple is so ridiculous!

589
2415
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,400
When did you get here?

590
2419
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:06,214
You should have called. Did you wait long?

591
2423
00:53:06,214 --> 00:53:10,357
No, I just got here. Where did you come from?

592
2427
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:18,100
Here and there, and went shopping.
 I bought you something. Come and see what I bought.

593
2432
00:53:24,846 --> 00:53:27,724
How's the color?  Is it alright?

594
2436
00:53:30,616 --> 00:53:33,540
What's wrong with your lips? Did you get into a fight?

595
2440
00:53:36,878 --> 00:53:39,543
If you don't want to tell me you don't have to...

596
2444
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:45,300
Try it on.  I bought it in the size I last remember. 
I'm not sure if you'll fit into it now.

597
2449
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:48,334
Later.

598
2453
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,300
Try it on, so I can exchange it if I need to tomorrow.

599
2457
00:54:04,468 --> 00:54:06,433
Did something happen?

600
2461
00:54:22,253 --> 00:54:26,739
Is that why you turned off your phone?

601
2465
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,900
I'm tired... I walked around too much today.

602
2469
00:54:46,752 --> 00:54:48,468
Wait.

603
2473
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,000
I'll do it for you.

604
2477
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,800
Don't you know this is weird? 
Why are you doing this?

605
2482
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:28,682
Do you have something to say to me?

606
2486
00:55:35,116 --> 00:55:37,970
I suddenly had a thought.

607
2490
00:55:40,376 --> 00:55:42,200
The mole on my cheek...

608
2494
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,700
You already knew about it.  
 We'd talked about it before.

609
2499
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,780
Long ago we talking about it.

610
2503
00:55:55,035 --> 00:55:56,399
Is that so?

611
2507
00:55:58,491 --> 00:56:00,627
I don't remember.

612
2511
00:56:02,899 --> 00:56:04,839
You must have forgotten.

613
2515
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:10,708
Something you already knew.

614
2519
00:56:12,529 --> 00:56:15,150
You've forgotten about it for 3 years.

615
2523
00:56:23,585 --> 00:56:28,838
I was under a treatment.. That's probably why.

616
2527
00:56:38,242 --> 00:56:40,593
Was that what you wanted to talk about?

617
2531
00:56:50,388 --> 00:56:52,921
During that time...

618
2535
00:56:56,698 --> 00:56:59,640
I've changed too.

619
2539
00:57:03,581 --> 00:57:06,186
Let's end it.

620
2543
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:26,692
Look at me.

621
2547
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:32,919
Look at me.

622
2551
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,771
Is it because of Kim Sam Soon?
♫ <i>At first  your fragrance which I didn't recognize was sensed.</i> ♫

623
2556
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:55,000
♫ <i>At first  your fragrance which I didn't recognize was sensed.</i> ♫

624
2560
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,970
♫
<i>The more time passes, ♫</i>

625
2565
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,899
Yes.♫
<i>The more time passes, ♫</i>

626
2570
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:03,950
♫<i> the more I change and change.</i>♫

627
2574
00:58:03,959 --> 00:58:05,140
Do you love her?

628
2578
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:10,020
<i>Oh my world full light is falling</i>

629
2582
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,480
♫<i>She is the girl,</i>♫

630
2586
00:58:12,484 --> 00:58:14,970
I keep...  thinking about her.
♫ What she is the one♫

631
2591
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:17,440
♫<i>Everything is changed.</i>♫

632
2595
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:21,000
I said do you love her?
♫<i>Everything is changed.</i>♫

633
2600
00:58:21,022 --> 00:58:21,748
I want to see her.
♫<i>Everything is changed.</i>♫

634
2605
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,000
I said do you love her?!
♫<i>Everything is changed.</i>♫

635
2610
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:29,290
♫<i>My ashamed heart which was hiding   </i>♫

636
2614
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:35,400
When we're together... I'm happy.
♫<i>  will give me everything  </i>♫

637
2619
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:46,040
♫<i> Your smile  moved me who was cold.</i>♫

638
2623
00:58:49,146 --> 00:58:52,281
She may be shining right now.

639
2627
00:58:52,281 --> 00:58:54,072
But...

640
2631
00:58:55,925 --> 00:59:03,377
It happens with everyone. 
That certain person may be the special person...

641
2636
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,300
But, when time passes,

642
2640
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:13,000
don't you think it will become nothing, like we are now?

643
2644
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:22,510
Do you still want to leave me?

644
2648
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,740
People

645
2652
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,400
continue living...knowing that we're all going to die.

646
2656
00:59:45,556 --> 00:59:47,899
How could you do this to me?

647
2660
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Who are you... Who are you to do this to me?!

648
2664
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,650
How can you do this to me?

649
2668
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:11,000
What are you that you are doing this to me?
