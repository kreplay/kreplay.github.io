00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:09,924
<i>Episode 2:  Should we try dating?</i>

2
7
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,229
Here is the kitchen.

3
11
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:16,637
Other Italian restaurants need
to boil the pasta.

4
16
00:00:16,637 --> 00:00:22,793
They always use many pots to boil,
but it's different here.

5
21
00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:24,276
My hometown is Yeosu.

6
25
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:26,630
Be comfortable and use a dialect.

7
29
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,123
No, I should hurry up and
learn without it.

8
34
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:34,630
What's with the unusual noise?
Huh?

9
39
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,731
He was twenty when he went on a backpacking trip 
to Europe and decided to live there.

10
44
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:44,843
Learned how to cook pasta there, and our
President scouted him while moving here.

11
49
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:51,340
Manager Oh, takes care of regulations
every month.

12
54
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,901
She used to be an elementary school teacher.

13
58
00:00:53,901 --> 00:01:00,440
Looks like she has a special relationship with 
our President, but we don't know the exact truth.

14
63
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,922
It hasn't been washed.
Why did you bring it out?

15
68
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,464
Never call out her name. Never use her name!

16
72
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,580
Why?

17
76
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:12,449
She doesn't like her name,
Jang Young Ja.

18
81
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,597
Do you know who Jang Young Ja is?

19
85
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:16,328
You don't know who
Jang Young Ja is?

20
90
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:18,336
No.

21
94
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,581
How can such a thing serve
as a generation gap?

22
99
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,389
She's a little impudent to the newbies,

23
103
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:29,062
but it shows how truthful she is.
So, it's alright.

24
108
00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:35,397
She might act like that to you, so
step on her with your age, okay?

25
113
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:37,117
Why is she like that to the
new employees?

26
118
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:42,040
Girl newbies. She's interested
in the President.

27
123
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,401
She likes that jerk?

28
127
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,470
He's a jerk?

29
131
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,805
No, he can be so.

30
135
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:52,819
I think he's cute.

31
139
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:57,080
No, if you're talking cute,  the cute one is the chef.

32
143
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:01,514
The President is... the President is...

33
147
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:04,985
I guess he's good looking.

34
151
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:10,382
He's even tall, can do any sports.
He's suave, and he can look sad.

35
156
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,200
You like the President?

36
160
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:18,373
I'm not the only one!
All the girls here do!

37
165
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,490
Ah, Jeez.

38
169
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
It's not a restaurant. It's a
fan club dedicated to him.

39
174
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:29,098
Why are people making
me laugh these days?

40
179
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,710
Dear, wow!

41
183
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,400
I love you.

42
187
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,504
What are you looking at?

43
191
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:31,260
What kind of luck do you need for a
husband like that.  Living a life of luxury,

44
196
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,763
coming to a restaurant that's above $100 per person and
getting a diamond ring that's a size of a bean...

45
201
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:40,592
Jealous?

46
205
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:44,413
He came with his girlfriend last week.
You still jealous?

47
210
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:45,811
Girlfriend?

48
214
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,600
He's a player.

49
218
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,450
He brought his wife to the restaurant that he brought his girlfriend to?

50
222
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,671
Maybe he's sure he won't get caught,
and his wife likes...

51
227
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:56,614
Unnie, where are you going?

52
231
00:03:56,614 --> 00:03:59,470
Hold on. Let me go. I just want to
say one word.

53
236
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,136
A word, or ten, it's not our problem
to be involved.

54
241
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:04,616
Hold on! Let me go,
I'm not butting in.

55
246
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:10,170
I just want to say a word. Hold on,
let me go. Gosh, you're so strong.

56
251
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,344
It's a pitiful sight with you two
and your aprons at the hall.

57
256
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:13,762
Hurry up and go into the kitchen!

58
260
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:14,548
It's not your concern, Miss Young Ja.

59
264
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:15,913
Not my concern?

60
268
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:18,927
Not my concern?! This is my hall! How
can I not be concerned?

61
273
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,500
And from now on call me Captain Jang!

62
277
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,100
What's up with her?

63
281
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,070
The name of this ice cream cake, 'Marquise Glace',

64
285
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,200
was given by King Louis XV of France who named it after his mistress Madame Pompadour.

65
289
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:42,384
Pompadour was the most enticing femme fatale in history.

66
293
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:44,760
And Louis XV, who was swayed by  his mistress,

67
297
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,030
through war and extravagance caused the French Revolution.

68
301
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,300
In short, the mistress and the stupid king screwed the country.

69
305
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,870
You need to protect your country! 
You should not destroy the country.

70
310
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,600
That is true happiness.

71
314
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,100
True happiness comes from united country. 
A country should not be treated lightly.

72
319
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,200
You need to protect your country.

73
323
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:18,500
Return to your country! 
Don't treat your country lightly!

74
328
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,200
You can never get divorced. Never! Never!

75
332
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,800
What are you doing now?

76
336
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:32,663
You saw everything. Why ask again?

77
340
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,800
It's not our concern if the customer
is a player or not.

78
345
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,883
You can live like that President,
but I can't ignore that.

79
350
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:43,958
Why? The most hated follower in this world happens to
be a guy who cheats.

80
355
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,330
The most hated and detested thing
also happens to be a guy who cheats.

81
360
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,528
The most inhumane thing that I would like to shoot to death, coincidentally, also happens to be a guy who cheats.

82
364
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:54,471
What I detest the most is a person who can't differentiate between a professional and personal experience,

83
368
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:57,546
losing control of their emotions, and ending up hysterically jumping up and down on the streets.

84
372
00:05:57,546 --> 00:06:01,408
So if you would like to continue
working here, follow my standpoint.

85
377
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:05,330
Per...personal experience?
What do you mean?

86
382
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,300
What is what?

87
386
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:12,018
By chance...

88
390
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,259
Finish what you were saying...

89
394
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:22,301
Fine, if you'd like me to obey, I will.

90
398
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:28,416
But President, what if a female customer
is being beaten by a male customer?

91
403
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,751
Should I continue to be unconcerned?

92
407
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,600
Don't be involved.

93
411
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,300
I'll make sure the bastard gets beaten.

94
415
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:56,993
Now to welcome our main character!

95
419
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,700
Our oldest!

96
423
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Hee Jin's response will be given!
Please welcome her with a round of applause!

97
428
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,918
I can usually sing really well,

98
432
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:25,253
but I can't respond back to your
warm welcome with just a song.

99
437
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:29,044
Instead, may I dance for everyone?

100
441
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,191
Boo! Hee Jin, don't deceive us.

101
445
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:12,968
That's right. If you can't dance, then do a strip show!

102
449
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,200
What kind of a misbehavior is this to a new employee?

103
453
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:19,881
Take off what? There's nothing to see.

104
457
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:21,014
No,

105
461
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:23,348
Young Ja. How do you know if there's something to see or not?

106
465
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:25,281
It's  Captain Jang!

107
469
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:26,710
Okay, Jang Captain.

108
473
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,195
How can you know without seeing me taking it off?

109
477
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,800
Then you're saying, there's something to look at?

110
481
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:36,391
That needs to be figured out once it's taken off, doesn't it?

111
485
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:39,165
Then will you really take it off?

112
489
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,500
Why should I?

113
493
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,800
Then let's call it an end to the welcome party.

114
497
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,600
Okay, let's leave.

115
501
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:52,209
How can he make a person feel so shameful?

116
505
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,500
What a sweet girl.

117
509
00:10:28,984 --> 00:10:32,205
You're not upset still, are you?

118
513
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,775
You can get your order on the left.

119
517
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,300
Thank you.

120
521
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,300
What would you like to order?

121
525
00:10:52,215 --> 00:11:00,021
Cafe latte: 175 kilocalories, one beer can,
20 minutes of inline skating.

122
530
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:08,653
Today's coffee: 5 kilocalories,
1/3 of a boiled egg, 5 minutes of kissing.

123
535
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:12,620
Fine, I'll stop drinking the latte first!

124
539
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,482
Stop being stuck to the old boy.

125
543
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:19,350
Lose weight and meet again with a new face!

126
547
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,809
May I have a latte with lots of syrup?

127
551
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:33,785
What?

128
555
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:36,121
You gain weight with just water.

129
559
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,630
Are you going to go on a blind date being bloated?

130
563
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,605
Darn,

131
567
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:43,079
Why are there such tasteful things in the world?

132
571
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:47,265
It's not that there are a lot of
tasteful things, you just like everything.

133
576
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:49,210
You even like dog poop?

134
580
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,128
Don't know, haven't eaten it.

135
584
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,100
You need to do well this time.

136
588
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,531
Not sure if this guy ate something wrong,

137
592
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:57,606
but he likes chubby girls like you.

138
596
00:11:57,606 --> 00:12:01,714
No, you don't know guys well.

139
600
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:04,585
Those type of guys always like the skinnier ones.

140
604
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:07,801
You crazy? What would I do with
the knowledge of guys at this age?

141
609
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:10,586
Anyway, this is all due to my name,

142
613
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:13,101
First sister II Young, second sister
Lee Young.

143
618
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:15,679
If I were Sam Young, I would have
been married by now.

144
623
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:20,756
Mom, did you tell him my name was Kim Hee Jin?

145
627
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,359
Yes. Yes, I did, so do well.

146
631
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,500
Born in 1970, Year of the Dog. That puts him in perfect harmony with you.

147
635
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:30,213
What? Born in 1970?

148
639
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:32,272
He's a total grandfather!

149
643
00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:34,006
Want me to bring you a chamber pot?

150
647
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:34,944
What chamber pot?

151
651
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,500
You sound like you're living in luxury
to take a dump in a chamber pot!

152
656
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,349
Good! I'll bring an end to it today!

153
660
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,840
I'm forgiving because he's handsome.

154
664
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,465
If he photo-shopped his face, it's over in an minute!

155
668
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:37,793
But out of all places why this hotel, like an omen...

156
672
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,800
Kim Hee Jin?

157
676
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,877
Yes?

158
680
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,666
It's me.

159
684
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:50,034
I am very sorry.

160
688
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:53,735
I couldn't bypass an accident that happened in front of me.

161
692
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:55,745
I was impulsively helping them out.

162
696
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,900
Sorry that I was late. I truly apologize.

163
700
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:05,114
No,

164
704
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:10,520
a blind date isn't that important compared to a person's life.

165
708
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,811
What a nice thing you've done.

166
712
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,933
Doesn't the Seoul City Hall give out commendations?

167
716
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Thank you for understanding.

168
720
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,423
I've been attending the society meetings 3 years ago.

169
724
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,600
I've heard news about you from time to time.

170
728
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,050
That you've come before, why aren't you attending these days?

171
732
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,600
Where have you touched up on?

172
736
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,930
Pardon?

173
740
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,324
Eyes?

174
744
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:46,651
Nose?

175
748
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,500
Jaw?

176
752
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,326
My nose and cheek bones.

177
756
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,500
Where, Japan?

178
760
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:54,689
Yes.

179
764
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:56,780
Heard Konoshimi  Masaki was good with the nose.

180
768
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,600
Yes, I got it done by him.

181
772
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,800
That's good.

182
776
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,080
Doesn't seem like you need to enlarge your breasts.

183
780
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,300
I like the natural ones.

184
784
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,949
The restaurant you own...

185
788
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,900
I would like to see it sometime.

186
792
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,150
At our meeting we alreadyf heard through word of mouth about it.

187
796
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,987
The food is good and the ambiance is excellent.

188
800
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:20,296
Especially the desserts are works of art.

189
804
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:21,655
Really?

190
808
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,100
Should I give the patissier a raise?

191
812
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,400
Please excuse me.

192
816
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,200
The baker makes who makes breads is the  boulangerie, the pastries, from the patisse and also patisserie,

193
820
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:38,836
Chocolate is Chocolatier.

194
824
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:43,875
The sweet jam and sugary stuff are Confiserie, 
and the ice creams are Glace.

195
829
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,894
Within those I am a specialist in the
bakery called a Patissier.

196
834
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:50,765
My dream is to open up my own shop someday.

197
838
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:52,969
Hee Jin's future husband must be lucky,

198
842
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:56,320
able to eat a handmade cake and chocolate whenever.

199
846
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,293
<i>Driving me crazy, him saying Hee Jin
with those lips is so erotic.</i>

200
851
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:09,637
<i>Okay! This is it! I'll slide with this vibe.</i>

201
855
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:14,535
Dating at a hotel she was dumped
at... how Sam Soon'ish is that?

202
860
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,084
There's someone in here.

203
864
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,692
There's someone in here.

204
868
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:55,305
Are you deaf?

205
872
00:16:55,305 --> 00:17:03,824
I can't see anyone right now
because I was dumped— leave me alone.

206
877
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:15,233
What are you doing, lady?

207
881
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,249
Are you a pervert?

208
885
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:21,007
Or are you
guarding the men's restroom?

209
890
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:40,280
If you get off the Train8Line, there's
a chocolate store called Michel Chaudun.

210
895
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,696
The interior of that store is
all covered in chocolate.

211
900
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:47,800
For a while after school, I'd go to the store

212
904
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,010
and  swore to eat every chocolate that was displayed there while studying.

213
908
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,060
So, did you eat it all?

214
912
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,322
No, unfortunately except just one.

215
916
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:01,907
One? What was that?

216
920
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
The columns.

217
924
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,009
<i>Perfect! I can drag this along nonstop
until the wedding, Kim Hee Jin!</i>

218
929
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:13,836
<i>You can do it!
Aja, aja! AJA!</i>

219
934
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,500
Sam Soon.

220
938
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,700
How am I suppose to handle it if you're like this?

221
942
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
You... know this person?

222
946
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,700
No...

223
950
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:36,292
No, I know this person. Our restaurant...

224
954
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:39,488
Today's blind meeting was just for formal issues.

225
958
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:41,582
We need time.

226
962
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:44,687
If we just make up time, we can talk my mother into compliance.

227
966
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:48,842
If we can't overcome the age difference, our love would be too vulnerable.

228
970
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Don't you trust me, Noona?

229
974
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,800
Noona...?

230
978
00:18:55,497 --> 00:19:00,264
What's gotten into you, President?

231
982
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:03,617
He's from our restaurant...

232
986
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:04,756
Stand up.

233
990
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:07,046
Let's go directly to Mother now, let's go!

234
994
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,703
What are you doing?

235
998
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,099
What are you doing, President?

236
1002
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:15,032
Let go! Why are you doing this, President? Let me go.

237
1006
00:19:15,032 --> 00:19:16,955
Let go! I said let go. You asshole!

238
1010
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,064
Let go of me! Really...
You crazy psycho!

239
1015
00:19:20,064 --> 00:19:22,004
Are you out of your mind?! Let go!

240
1019
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:24,646
Are you going to take care of me? Are you?

241
1023
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:51,742
The situation has been resolved.

242
1027
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,500
Get a hold of yourself, Kim Sam Soon...
I mean Kim Hee Jin.

243
1032
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,700
Aren't you hungry?
Let's go eat somewhere.

244
1037
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,300
Do I look  like a pushover to you?

245
1041
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,800
Do you know what you have done?

246
1045
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:18,765
You...

247
1049
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:23,386
...don't have a drop of humanity.

248
1053
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:32,361
What? Food? You go stuff yourself

249
1057
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:36,392
and have my severance pay ready, you bastard.

250
1061
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,386
You must be mistaken,

251
1065
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:59,104
but is there a job that gives a resignation
compensation to a temporary employee?

252
1070
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,291
What kind of a judgment is that? How stingy.

253
1074
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:10,728
I shouldn't acquaint myself with a person who has no imagination.

254
1078
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:14,941
The judgments are always beautiful.

255
1082
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:17,871
Beautiful? My as*...

256
1086
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:24,182
Can I have a latte with lots of syrup?

257
1090
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:29,459
Another latte. I don't need the syrup.

258
1094
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,773
Do you usually persuade a person like that?

259
1098
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:36,242
5% raise.

260
1102
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,000
You even flirted well, very deceitful.

261
1106
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,700
10% raise.

262
1110
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,200
When will you stop making fun of me?

263
1114
00:22:53,253 --> 00:22:57,359
That's final because there's a line of
principle with the employees and me.

264
1119
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,435
A dog's barking somewhere.

265
1123
00:23:00,435 --> 00:23:02,544
Okay fine, a full time employee.

266
1127
00:23:02,544 --> 00:23:05,792
No one has ever become a full time
employee after their temporary phase.

267
1132
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:08,383
A cow is even mooing.

268
1136
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:10,571
Then, what can I do?

269
1140
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:13,666
Should I reverse time? Bring back the guy from earlier?

270
1144
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:17,479
Yes! Turn back time and bring him
to the same position.

271
1149
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,300
You have to do it.

272
1153
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,733
She really has a unique quality.

273
1157
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:33,702
I bought the coffee, so you can pay for this.

274
1161
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
One round trip please.

275
1165
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,300
One round trip.

276
1169
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,800
What's up with them? Why aren't they getting on?

277
1173
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:48,020
What on earth did you say? Why didn't they get on?

278
1177
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,300
I told them to help me propose to you.

279
1181
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:58,854
You're not sorry.

280
1185
00:24:58,854 --> 00:25:01,980
You followed me because it might
interrupt your business, huh?

281
1190
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,165
That's why I am promoting you as a full time employee.

282
1194
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:06,709
In a world like today,

283
1198
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:10,996
it's better than a man who might
lose his job anytime soon, right?

284
1203
00:25:10,996 --> 00:25:13,090
Didn't you hear what I was saying?

285
1207
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,994
I want to get married!

286
1211
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:16,907
Why?

287
1215
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:17,720
Do you not know?

288
1219
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Of course I wouldn't know. How well do you know me?

289
1223
00:25:23,997 --> 00:25:28,932
It's scary to cross the Pacific Ocean in a rowboat all alone.

290
1227
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,100
Rather than being alone, having another person
would help double the speed of rowing.

291
1232
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:39,056
Look, it's less frightening although we're up this high,

292
1236
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:41,935
but if you or I came up all alone, wouldn't it be scary?

293
1240
00:25:41,935 --> 00:25:45,971
I normally don't come near dangerous types of machines.

294
1244
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:48,491
What a coward.

295
1248
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,700
You don't even drive.

296
1252
00:25:54,862 --> 00:25:56,443
Right now?

297
1256
00:25:56,443 --> 00:25:59,691
Guess what I'm doing.

298
1260
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,684
I'm riding the cable car.

299
1264
00:26:03,684 --> 00:26:07,098
Yes, the Nam San cable car.

300
1268
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:10,546
After checking in, I came out
because it was so pretty.

301
1273
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:13,737
Wow it's so pretty here.
Magical.

302
1278
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:20,277
Of course, I like it here
better than California.

303
1283
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,130
♫<i>Because I didn't forget, there was  bright and innocent laughter. </i>

304
1287
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:37,020
♫<i> Because our days which shined </i> ♫

305
1291
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:43,990
♫<i>  Are already erased, there are breathless tears. </i>♫

306
1295
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:50,170
♫<i>  I appear to be deathly ill. </i>♫

307
1299
00:26:50,170 --> 00:27:03,400
♫ <i>  My beautiful beloved, take my hand.  </i>♫

308
1303
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,750
♫<i> Again to me ...</i>♫

309
1307
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:07,724
Did you hear from them?

310
1311
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:13,607
He hasn't come in yet?
My daughter isn't home either.

311
1316
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:20,511
Maybe they'll get married this fall!

312
1320
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,330
Did someone call?

313
1324
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,956
No, nobody called.

314
1328
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,400
What is this?

315
1332
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,580
It's a salt lamp to help purify the air.

316
1336
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,623
It's perfect for those who live alone.

317
1340
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:40,215
People who live alone? Why?

318
1344
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,700
A human is said to have a peculiar smell
once living alone, even females.

319
1349
00:27:47,786 --> 00:27:49,290
Order me one.

320
1353
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,354
Are you getting it for Mijoo?

321
1357
00:27:51,354 --> 00:27:53,896
She's only 7 years old. You think she needs one?

322
1361
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,200
You're rightf. She still has a milk aroma.

323
1365
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:03,345
Hello? It's the Seoul Hotel's office.

324
1369
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:05,418
Yes, please hold on.

325
1373
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,100
It's Mrs. Kim.

326
1377
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,070
Must be about her daughter's blind date.

327
1381
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,443
Mrs.Kim? Yes, this is President Na.

328
1385
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:21,700
Yes, yes. Excuse me?
It's a name I've never heard of.

329
1390
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,222
Can you hold on Mrs.Kim?

330
1394
00:28:24,222 --> 00:28:29,121
Have you possibly heard of the name
Sam Soon from Jin Hun?

331
1399
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:29,784
No.

332
1403
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,200
Perhaps he is dating someone?
- I don't think so.

333
1408
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:38,246
Mrs.Kim, it's my first time
hearing that name.

334
1413
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:41,661
Why would I set up a blind date if he had a girl?

335
1417
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,300
And I don't want to think of marriage
and dating as two different things.

336
1422
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:48,265
What did you say?

337
1426
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:50,049
You haven't canceled what you said earlier.

338
1430
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:52,545
I would never do such a thing,
so give up.

339
1435
00:28:52,545 --> 00:28:56,984
Plus, don't dream about being forgiven
by using the cable car time as an excuse.

340
1440
00:28:56,984 --> 00:29:00,542
I wouldn't twice think about working beneath a guy

341
1444
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,200
who is convinced he's a half-baked prince and
steps on other people's lives as a hobby.

342
1449
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,800
A half-baked prince?

343
1453
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:47,300
Even if it's only in a dream, even if it's just for one day,

344
1457
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:54,500
I want to meet the man who is my fate.

345
1461
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,940
I hate being alone

346
1465
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:09,100
Tonight,  if you would pour men on the street like the rain.

347
1469
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,540
It's raining men!

348
1473
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,980
I want to meet the man who is my fate.

349
1477
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:47,459
Lady, get me another bottle of soju,
egg roll, and chicken feet.

350
1482
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:56,665
Hey, isn't that our half-baked Prince?
What are you staring at?

351
1487
00:30:56,665 --> 00:30:58,877
Don't mind me, Noon-nim.

352
1491
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:07,919
What Noon-nim? Mister, did you
just call me Noon-nim?

353
1496
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,541
You're older, and you're calling me mister?

354
1500
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:12,743
It's disturbing.

355
1504
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:19,895
Mister, once a guy graduates high school,
they're all named, 'Mister'.

356
1509
00:31:19,895 --> 00:31:21,946
You're not even my boss.

357
1513
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,307
Whose decision is that?

358
1517
00:31:23,307 --> 00:31:27,415
You can come in freely but can't once you leave.

359
1521
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:29,880
Are you some kind of a family clique? Huh?

360
1525
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:33,734
Lady, how long are you staying like this?

361
1529
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:34,871
Share the table with the guy!

362
1533
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:36,373
Huh?

363
1537
00:31:36,373 --> 00:31:37,798
Don't you see there's no table left?

364
1541
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:43,803
Stop talking nonsense and go sit with her.

365
1545
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,400
Lady, who said I'm sharing the table?

366
1549
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:52,000
You have a weird personality.

367
1553
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,170
It seemed like he was apologizing.

368
1557
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:58,300
Give it up. What are you doing with the guy?

369
1561
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:04,100
I'm going insane. Lady!
THAT ISN'T MY BOYFRIEND.

370
1566
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:07,593
You're not?

371
1570
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:12,002
No, I am. We even locked lips earlier.

372
1574
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:16,104
Stop joking.With a cute boyfriend
like that, I would carry him on my back.

373
1579
00:32:16,104 --> 00:32:18,750
Don't get into arguments and be nice to each other.

374
1583
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,400
Blossoming spring isn't always around.

375
1587
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:29,310
Look what you did. She mistook me as an old fox.

376
1591
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:36,726
He still isn't picking up?

377
1595
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:39,441
Yes, it's still turned off.

378
1599
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:42,367
Brat, I can clearly see through his acting.

379
1603
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,193
It might not be acting.

380
1607
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:44,959
If it isn't acting...?

381
1611
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:49,024
If it were acting, wouldn't it be a typical name?

382
1615
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:51,356
Sam Soon isn't a common name to use.

383
1619
00:32:51,356 --> 00:32:54,175
Then you're saying, he must be
dating a girl named Sam Soon?

384
1624
00:32:54,175 --> 00:32:56,572
Any possibility.
We should be open-minded.

385
1629
00:32:56,572 --> 00:32:57,543
Ah my head...

386
1633
00:32:57,543 --> 00:33:01,008
The name has double S. It might be hard to pronounce.

387
1637
00:33:01,008 --> 00:33:02,600
Kim Sam Soon.

388
1641
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Ah my head...

389
1645
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:29,200
So what I'm saying is, the world
might revolve around prime elites,

390
1650
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,017
but people like me, referred to as ants, can't be stepped on!

391
1654
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:43,682
But! You stepped on me today and without any hesitation.

392
1658
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:47,778
That's why. Tell me your ideal type.

393
1662
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:50,656
I'll introduce you to someone around me.

394
1666
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:55,944
What ideal type?
I won't be fooled once again, huh?

395
1671
00:33:55,944 --> 00:33:59,743
But, since you're wondering, I'll tell you.

396
1675
00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:04,698
My ideal type is...

397
1679
00:34:04,698 --> 00:34:12,264
A guy that has a stable job and
brings back the monthly salary to me.

398
1684
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:16,753
That's a wide range,
try being specific.

399
1689
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,062
A guy who can kiss well.

400
1693
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,700
You are an old fox..!

401
1697
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,800
And what else?

402
1701
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,900
You're fooling around.

403
1705
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:49,606
And, a person I can proudly introduce to my parents and sisters that he's my man.

404
1709
00:34:49,606 --> 00:35:02,527
And introducing me to his parents and friends, very proudly that I am his woman.

405
1713
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:03,687
That's easy.

406
1717
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:12,001
What easy? You jerk! Do you know how hard that is?

407
1721
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:16,970
That's very hard. You know why?

408
1725
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:21,933
Because he didn't do it that way,

409
1729
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:30,859
he hid me and didn't introduce me to anyone.

410
1733
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:33,344
That's how he could easily cheat.

411
1737
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,500
"Cheater" clearly was written on his face.
A person who didn't see...

412
1742
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:52,583
Right, I thought it was suspicious.

413
1746
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:56,802
You always had an unpleasant look for me,
and laughed at me unpleasantly as well.

414
1751
00:35:56,802 --> 00:36:01,363
Hey you! From where on do you remember? Huh?

415
1755
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:10,206
Hurry up and tell me. From what point on did you remember?

416
1759
00:36:10,206 --> 00:36:11,203
Everything from the beginning.

417
1763
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:18,200
All of it? Hey! From where to
when do you remember?

418
1768
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,400
What are you hiding? There was nothing to see.

419
1772
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,659
Then why did you act like you didn't know? Huh?

420
1776
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:51,736
There wasn't an advantage for me if I said it.

421
1780
00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:53,118
It would have been a waste of time for me to do it.

422
1784
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:55,718
You should have kept it to yourself until the end.

423
1788
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,600
Why should I?

424
1792
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:03,257
That I don't know, but...erase that memory.

425
1796
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:05,316
I wish I could too.

426
1800
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:12,307
What does that mean? Meaning the
memory was that horrifying?

427
1805
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,000
Stop overdoing it, lady.

428
1809
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,855
What lady?

429
1813
00:37:16,855 --> 00:37:21,215
You must have eaten something rotten. Let's go.

430
1817
00:37:21,215 --> 00:37:23,704
Excuse me, how much is the total?

431
1821
00:37:23,704 --> 00:37:26,410
Hey! Mister!

432
1825
00:37:28,587 --> 00:37:33,093
Why are you paying?
Lady, how much is it?

433
1830
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:34,900
$76.

434
1834
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,508
Ah lady, are you ripping me off
because I'm drunk?

435
1839
00:37:42,652 --> 00:37:45,565
Why are you being childish with a
pretty boyfriend standing there?

436
1844
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:47,080
Should I sum it up for you?

437
1848
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,450
5 bottles of soju, 1 udon, 1 sushi roll, 1 eel,

438
1852
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,200
1 egg roll, 1 chicken feet, 1 pork bone and 1 clam.

439
1856
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,200
Why did I eat so much?

440
1860
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:08,980
Darn it, I only have twenty bucks.

441
1864
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,400
Wait, I need to go get some money from the ATM.

442
1868
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,938
Keep this as ransom.

443
1872
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,300
Just tell your boyfriend to pay for it.

444
1876
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:29,826
Lady, you shouldn't live life like that, and how can I bum off him?

445
1880
00:38:29,826 --> 00:38:34,035
Lady just wait a bit.
I'll go get the money.

446
1885
00:38:40,113 --> 00:38:42,552
Your neighborhood was Boo Ham, right?

447
1889
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,800
I'll go get money. You wait, Sam Shik.

448
1893
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,600
Do you want to die?

449
1897
00:38:54,952 --> 00:38:57,890
Jerk, dying isn't that easy!

450
1901
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,050
It's easy! It's easy, so be careful!

451
1905
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,500
Always be alert, and open both your eyes!

452
1909
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:15,735
Oh, is that right...? You were that worried for this Noon-nim?

453
1913
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:20,089
Jerk, where are you screaming at?

454
1917
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:25,496
Don't overdo it, just wait.
I'll go get money, Sam Shik.

455
1922
00:39:46,602 --> 00:39:50,262
Please select one of the following menu.

456
1926
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,000
I already paid.

457
1930
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Who asked you to pay for it?

458
1934
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:16,235
My piggy, Sam Sook. Hold on,
I'll take out money and pay for it.

459
1939
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,900
Don't look!

460
1943
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:29,052
4, 4, 4, 8.

461
1947
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,300
What are you laughing at?

462
1951
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Hehe, it's coming out.

463
1955
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,800
Why are you laughing?

464
1959
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,800
Are you mocking me because
I only took out a hundred bucks?

465
1964
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:02,134
Jerk, where are you turning your head?

466
1968
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,400
Hey! Didn't you eat? Do it too if you think it's unfair.

467
1972
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:16,121
What do we do? What do we do?

468
1976
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:19,684
The gate is shutting down! What do we do?

469
1980
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,400
Be quiet!

470
1984
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,100
Hey you bastard. This is why you're unlucky for me!

471
1988
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,500
Go away! Go away! You bastard!

472
1992
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:46,781
You shouldn't have gone in there if it was nearing closing time.

473
1996
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,500
I mean, don't you have any
common sense being young?

474
2001
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,941
I'm sorry.

475
2005
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,800
And how much alcohol did you give 
to your girlfriend that she's like this?

476
2010
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,300
I didn't feed it to her.

477
2014
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,100
Wow, she's totally out.

478
2018
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,909
Hey, you bastard.

479
2022
00:42:14,307 --> 00:42:16,912
Yeah, just hit me.
♫ <i>Are you lonesome tonight? </i>♫

480
2027
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,600
Like I wouldn't be able to hit?
♫Do you miss me tonight♫

481
2032
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:32,571
What? Argh? Why the deep sigh? You don't deserve to sigh. 
♫ <i>Are you sorry we drifted apart? </i>♫

482
2037
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:41,200
Whom are you sighing at after cheating on me?
♫ <i>Does your memory stray, to a bright sunny day?</i> ♫

483
2042
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,700
Sighing?
♫ When I kissed you♫

484
2047
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:49,215
Your love is only up to here, and you can still live well?
♫<i>and called you sweet love. </i>♫

485
2052
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:53,030
Stop playing around, you jerk! How conceited can you be?
♫ <i>Do the chairs </i>♫

486
2057
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:57,836
People like you should all die.I'm going to kill you!

487
2062
00:42:57,836 --> 00:42:59,547
You horrible jerk! I'm going to kill you!
♫ and bare♫

488
2067
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,440
You horrible jerk! I'm going to kill you!

489
2071
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:11,010
♫ <i>Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there? </i>♫

490
2075
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:13,000
♫<i> Is your heart filled with pain? </i>♫

491
2079
00:43:13,006 --> 00:43:15,940
Right, meeting a man has nothing to do with fate,

492
2083
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,100
but you still can't do it. ♫<i> Shall I come back again? </i>♫

495
2095
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:55,708
'Cause of this damn pig,
it ruined my entire dream.

496
2100
00:45:55,842 --> 00:45:58,488
Why are you here?

497
2104
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,400
Because it's my house.

498
2108
00:46:04,153 --> 00:46:05,706
Wash up because you smell.

499
2112
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,300
The dry cleaners will
bring your clothes soon.

500
2117
00:46:13,663 --> 00:46:16,094
You jerk, asshole! You asshole!

501
2121
00:46:16,094 --> 00:46:22,513
You jerk, who you think
you are to do this to me?

502
2126
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:31,496
What you hit me? Asshole!
You hit me? Fine! Hit me! Hit me!

503
2131
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,200
Wash up first, can't you smell?

504
2135
00:46:40,856 --> 00:46:44,117
You! Do you know what's the
worst a guy can do to a girl?

505
2140
00:46:44,117 --> 00:46:47,091
Violating a drunk girl. Plus acting like nothing had happened.

506
2144
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,400
I'll teach you a lesson!

507
2148
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:53,437
Let go you bastard!

508
2152
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:56,568
Who would violate a girl that urinates
on top of someone's back?

509
2157
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:02,631
You, according to your own words,
you are truthfully dirty.

510
2162
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:11,268
Funny, don't lie!
I don't have drinking habits.

511
2167
00:47:15,564 --> 00:47:18,336
I kind of slept... peacefully.

512
2171
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:19,989
Peacefully?

513
2175
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,384
Said I talk in my sleep.

514
2179
00:47:21,384 --> 00:47:22,650
Just talking in your sleep?

515
2183
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:27,040
No, I throw up, too,once or twice in a year.

516
2187
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:34,366
I mean, you! President,
didn't have... luck.

517
2192
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,600
Haven't you heard from the drinking buddies you use the fist a lot? That is...

518
2196
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,670
That is ...

519
2200
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:43,358
Don't smile like that.

520
2204
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:45,643
Do you know how horrible
it makes a person feel?

521
2209
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,638
Do you know how dirty you made me feel all night?

522
2213
00:47:50,638 --> 00:47:52,123
Then why did you bring me here?

523
2217
00:47:52,123 --> 00:47:54,871
Don't know where you live. You lost control of yourself,

524
2221
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,216
and your cell phone battery ran out.

525
2225
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,500
So why take off my clothes?
You should have let me go to sleep.

526
2230
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:04,938
Maintenance? It's apartment 402.

527
2234
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:07,895
I would like to request a cleaner today.

528
2238
00:48:07,895 --> 00:48:11,498
Change all the bed sheets, blankets and ventilate the place.

529
2242
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:17,800
Oh! And please sterilize the place,
a not so clean guest had come by.

530
2247
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:24,595
In your stomach, the sushi roll, udon,
eel, chicken feet, and mackerel.

531
2252
00:48:24,595 --> 00:48:26,808
There wasn't a worse chemical formula than that.

532
2256
00:48:26,808 --> 00:48:29,829
Taking off your clothes was a  survival instinct.

533
2260
00:48:31,145 --> 00:48:34,632
Are you a lizard, why are you cutting off my words?

534
2264
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,000
And! Why aren't you talking formally to me? Why?

535
2268
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:48,010
Jin Hun, where is this kid? Where are you

536
2272
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:51,322
Alright jerk, you stay right there!

537
2276
00:48:51,322 --> 00:48:56,333
What happened? What did you do that?
Miss Kim is acting insanely?

538
2281
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,923
What is it? What else did you do this time?

539
2285
00:48:58,923 --> 00:49:02,207
Huh? I can't live because of you!

540
2289
00:49:03,427 --> 00:49:06,191
Oh my gosh! A girl's in here.

541
2293
00:49:07,565 --> 00:49:10,320
Who's that girl that's almost naked!!

542
2297
00:49:12,487 --> 00:49:14,955
You shouldn't come without calling.  No manners...

543
2301
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:18,092
What, manners? Did you just say manners?

544
2305
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:22,106
Fine! You want to know how manners in the Na family work.

545
2309
00:49:23,267 --> 00:49:24,406
You come here.

546
2313
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:29,400
President, listen to me,
Na president! Mom! Mother!

547
2318
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:35,079
Mom, they can hear us...

548
2322
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,100
Manners...

549
2326
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,674
Young lady, don't you have any clothing?

550
2330
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:10,230
Why are you like that?

551
2334
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:15,389
Oh, because the clothes haven't come from the dry cleaners yet.

552
2338
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:17,604
Coming to someone's house,

553
2342
00:50:17,604 --> 00:50:20,471
and dry cleaning your clothes.
Are you that close with my son?

554
2347
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,500
President Na.

555
2351
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:27,102
You can answer, Miss.

556
2355
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,400
Do you have a serious relationship with my son?

557
2359
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,400
Yes.

558
2363
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,500
What kind of serious relationship?

559
2367
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,411
I have ownership of the president,
and the president has ownership of me.

560
2372
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:49,710
It's a deep relationship.

561
2376
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,700
Why a restaurant girl? Why didn't the person report it to me!

562
2380
00:50:59,952 --> 00:51:02,511
Who's Sam Soon?

563
2384
00:51:02,543 --> 00:51:04,311
President Na, please excuse this tardiness.

564
2388
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,551
Tell me first who's the Sam Soon girl

565
2392
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,900
That you grabbed yesterday at the date?

566
2396
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,800
It's me.

567
2400
00:51:18,313 --> 00:51:21,111
But, is she really his mother?

568
2404
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,354
They don't look anything alike.

569
2408
00:51:23,354 --> 00:51:27,576
She doesn't have a mustache, but
looks exactly like a blowfish!

570
2413
00:51:27,576 --> 00:51:30,111
They're really an unpleasant mother and son.

571
2417
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,800
Is she an aunt or sister?

572
2421
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,200
Seriously a bizarre family.

573
2425
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,060
<i>Gyeonghuigung Dry Cleaners</i>

574
2429
00:52:12,219 --> 00:52:16,270
Does it hurt? I'm hurt too.

575
2433
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:19,242
It happens to be a girl who can't take care of herself?

576
2437
00:52:19,242 --> 00:52:21,824
You immature wretch,
owning your own business!

577
2442
00:52:21,824 --> 00:52:23,296
You can't distinguish betweeen heaven and earth...

578
2446
00:52:23,296 --> 00:52:24,576
and you go ahead and cheat with a girl who works for you?

579
2450
00:52:24,576 --> 00:52:26,541
Did I teach you that way?

580
2454
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:29,246
It isn't immoral, and I'm single.
How can that be cheating?

581
2459
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,349
Are you kidding?

582
2463
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,100
Joking? At that meeting...

583
2467
00:52:36,085 --> 00:52:38,530
Bring her within this week for a formal greeting.

584
2471
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:46,895
Going on blind dates and humiliating the
family reputation has been done enough.

585
2476
00:52:46,895 --> 00:52:50,777
Since you seem to like her,
let's have a meal together.

586
2481
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:55,001
I'm not doing this because I like her.

587
2485
00:52:55,001 --> 00:52:58,181
You saw every girl as a rock for several years, and shivered

588
2489
00:52:58,181 --> 00:53:02,493
f someone even sat on your bed because you were a neat freak.

589
2493
00:53:02,493 --> 00:53:06,197
But allowing that girl to sleep on your
bed means you like her that much.

590
2498
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,137
Bring her within this week.

591
2502
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:13,110
But don't be so glad about it.

592
2506
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:17,867
Once I see her formally and can't decipher 
between a joke and a response like a child,

593
2511
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:21,138
I will do everything in my
strength to split you two apart.

594
2516
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,600
You understand? I asked if you understand?

595
2520
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,800
Yes, Mother.

596
2524
00:53:40,057 --> 00:53:44,154
Aren't you eating? This is the best after drinking.

597
2528
00:53:47,542 --> 00:53:49,142
Oh! Refreshing.

598
2532
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,100
You pay for this since I paid yesterday.

599
2536
00:53:53,888 --> 00:53:56,502
It's okay, you can deduct it
from my final compensation.

600
2541
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,900
You're so bold at this kind of economy!

601
2545
00:54:02,926 --> 00:54:07,338
There's nothing to life. I'll just live with boldness.

602
2549
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,600
Life has nothing to it, but being bold
doesn't have monthly salaries.

603
2554
00:54:14,327 --> 00:54:19,085
<i>Yeah, can't compare this job to anything with good pay.</i>

604
2558
00:54:19,085 --> 00:54:27,170
<i>And I need to save money to get a
loan and open a shop or something.</i>

605
2563
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:30,856
<i>Or I'll be half killed once Mom knows I quit.</i>

606
2567
00:54:30,856 --> 00:54:34,380
<i>Should I close my eyes just once and forget nothing happened?</i>

607
2571
00:54:35,345 --> 00:54:38,220
<i>He really is good looking.</i>

608
2575
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,701
<i>How did he come from Mrs. Blowfish?</i>

609
2579
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:44,479
<i>By chance... is he adopted?</i>

610
2583
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,900
<i>Or like those famous drama prince
characters where there's a birth secret.</i>

611
2588
00:54:56,310 --> 00:55:01,111
Fine, if the patissiere keeps changing,

612
2592
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:05,941
there might be a disadvantage while managing the restaurant.

613
2596
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:09,515
And rather being irresponsible, I'll forbear it. Okay?

614
2600
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:15,100
Then, it'll be this month that I'll be accepted as a formal employee?

615
2604
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,700
If too much, then starting next month?

616
2608
00:55:29,688 --> 00:55:34,270
If that's hard, then raising my income up 15%?

617
2612
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,100
10%.

618
2616
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,900
No?

619
2620
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,800
Isn't it exhausting to go on blind dates?

620
2624
00:55:48,986 --> 00:55:51,284
Seems like you shouldn't be worried about others.

621
2628
00:55:51,284 --> 00:55:52,851
Are you seeing anyone right now?

622
2632
00:55:56,662 --> 00:55:59,189
Are you making fun of me? Huh?

623
2636
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,971
I mean if I had a guy,

624
2640
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:04,829
why would I spend my golden free day on blind dates?

625
2644
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:08,058
You have a special skill of making fun of people.

626
2648
00:56:09,975 --> 00:56:15,582
Miss Kim Sam Soon.
Oh, Miss Kim Hee Jin...

627
2653
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,212
Yes?

628
2657
00:56:21,672 --> 00:56:24,977
Should we...try dating?

629
2661
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,200
