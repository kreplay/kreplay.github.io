<i>Episode 7
The Madeleine, in Search of Lost Time.</i>

2
8
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:24,144
She's pretty.

3
12
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:36,030
That one's pretty, too.

4
16
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:40,732
How lucky for them to be so young.

5
20
00:00:41,603 --> 00:00:44,024
What's up with you, not nitpicking?

6
24
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:46,740
I'm sick of it.

7
28
00:00:51,112 --> 00:00:52,827
Aren't you, too?

8
32
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:55,021
You've got no energy to nitpick on me, now?

9
36
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,675
There's nothing new with life.

10
40
00:00:57,675 --> 00:01:00,588
What for? There's nothing special.

11
44
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,861
I keep sleeping less in the morning.

12
48
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,066
When I wake up thinking that it's morning, it's still not even four.

13
52
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,670
I just lie down like a dead person until others get up.

14
56
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,773
Thinking why I lived such a hectic life. Searching for god knows what.

15
60
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:14,374
Hey.

16
64
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,044
Do you know why you get less sleep as you get older?

17
68
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,379
So that before you die, you can hurry up and do more.

18
72
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,247
Brother...

19
76
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,048
What?

20
80
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:23,283
Give this hotel to Jin Hyun.

21
84
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,600
Ahh, all that talk about life was to get to that point, right?

22
88
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,591
You've got no one to leave the hotel, anyway.

23
92
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,800
If you don't like it, then get married now and have a child.

24
96
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,600
Hey, this woman's pretty, and that one's pretty. How can I choose one?

25
100
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,100
Yoon Sook, how about you becoming my wife?

26
104
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,300
Stop being silly!

27
108
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:55,249
They are trying to earn the current market value of 200 million worth company with only a lousy 2 million dollar contract fee.

28
112
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:59,586
That is nonsense.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with finding a supervisory committee here?

29
116
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,500
Are they blind?

30
120
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,300
But...Jin Hyun, your tastes have changed a lot.

31
124
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,900
Isn't she a bit...

32
128
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,430
Don't be so informal. She's older than us.

33
132
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,100
She must cost a lot in feeding expenses.

34
136
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,400
Were you desperate?

35
140
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,400
Were you that hungry?

36
144
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:30,150
Do you think you're a princess, getting to come to fancy hotels like this?

37
148
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,500
Don't be mistaken. Jin Hyun is just playing around with you.

38
152
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,167
What?

39
156
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
These level of people will not accept you into their world so easily.

40
160
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,561
Hey! What does it matter to you whether they accept me?

41
164
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm worried that you'll be hurt.

42
168
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,900
Hurt? Coming from you?

43
172
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,800
Just stop right here. It'll just get harder later on.

44
176
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,400
Look here, Min Hyun Woo.

45
180
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,083
Never mind. It's pointless, anyway.

46
184
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,400
I saw this on a business trip to Spain and thought you might like it.

47
188
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:32,286
What do you think? Don't you think it matches her?

48
192
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,000
What the heck are you doing?!

49
196
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,795
I told you I wouldn't let it go if you came near her again.

50
200
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,300
What right do you have? Stop playing around with her!

51
204
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:09,550
Hey, hey! Have you seen Jin Hyun? He was here a minute ago.

52
208
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,885
He was here a second ago...

53
212
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:12,486
Just look over there.

54
216
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,900
Stop! You bastard, who do you think you're hitting!

55
220
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,860
What are they doing?!

56
224
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,800
They must be crazy.

57
228
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,436
Ah! Let go!

58
232
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Kim Sam Soon!

59
236
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,100
Not going to let go?

60
240
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,810
Where do you think you're biting!

61
244
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,978
I bit a dog, so what?

62
248
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,581
What?

63
252
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,149
This bitch! Hey!

64
256
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,518
Let go.

65
260
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,787
No! Who told you to mess with him?

66
264
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,654
Let go while I'm asking nicely.

67
268
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,355
I won't!

68
272
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,500
This girl is...

69
276
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,465
Let go!

70
280
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,200
Shut up,  you bitch!

71
284
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:11,851
-Shut up you bitch! 
-Ow!

72
289
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,000
I told you to let go when I asked nicely!

73
293
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,786
Let go! Let go! Let go of me!

74
297
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,389
Let me go!

75
301
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:31,698
You must have forgotten I played basketball in high school!

76
305
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,968
And as for you

77
309
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:36,971
I meant to keep it secret forever, but

78
313
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,800
you're the one who provoked this.

79
317
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,700
Got it?

80
321
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,200
What is she saying? Secret?

81
325
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Let's go.

82
329
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,900
Hey, bug!

83
333
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,911
I guess you don't know yet, but...

84
337
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,914
I'm Sam Soon's first man.

85
341
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,317
Do you know what that means? You  bastard bug!

86
345
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:29,090
Come on.

87
349
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:56,082
Let go of me already.

88
353
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,718
Come on. Let go of me.

89
357
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,987
Ow, it hurts...

90
361
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,955
Did you forget the terms of our contract?

91
365
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,157
Why do you keep cheating on me?

92
369
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,393
Who says I'm cheating on you?

93
373
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:07,528
You keep meeting up with that bastard.

94
377
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,163
What do you mean? Did I meet him on purpose?

95
381
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,165
Who was it that brought me here?

96
385
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:16,720
Even if you met by chance, you should have run away.

97
389
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,507
Huh. I can't even..

98
393
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:22,743
When I'm being used for your own childish revenge,

99
397
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,478
is it right for you to scold me so harshly

100
401
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,913
for talking  a short while?

101
405
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,915
Don't you have any pride? Why do you keep talking back?

102
409
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,985
Whether I do, what does it matter to you?

103
413
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,300
If I tell you not to do it, then don't!

104
417
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,491
From now on, whether it's that guy or another, don't talk to them.

105
421
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,800
Don't talk to them or listen.  Only listen to me!

106
425
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,900
Wow, this is totally like Africa.

107
429
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,925
You did well.

108
433
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,527
What?

109
437
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,763
When you bit that guy earlier.

110
441
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,500
Huh. That guy... just say you like me if you do!

111
445
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,500
"Only listen to me. Listen only to me."

112
449
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,100
It seems you have finally fallen for Sam Soon's charms.

113
453
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,787
Wait... Is this guy normal?

114
457
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,700
If he does it again, perhaps he will do the same thing again.

115
461
00:09:25,796 --> 00:09:27,437
I don't even know...

116
465
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:31,972
Why, of all people, was it Sam Soon?

117
469
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,537
There's too much difference in quality!

118
473
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:37,944
Oh, calm down! How many times do I need to tell you?

119
477
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,415
You dated that low class woman, and you expect to marry me?

120
481
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,450
Ha! What do I look like to you?

121
485
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,252
Sam Soon clung onto me and followed me around. That's it!

122
489
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,222
She was the one coming on to me when Jin Hyun went overboard.

123
493
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,791
What was that about being her first man?

124
497
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,828
I was so drunk I don't even remember!

125
501
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,130
But she was the one saying it was her first that took responsibility.

126
505
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,733
I'm not that reckless. I am responsible for my actions.

127
509
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,002
That's why I just endured it till now.

128
513
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,271
I don't care.

129
517
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,841
I'm calling off the engagement!  Right now.

130
521
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,420
Fine. Call it off.

131
525
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,178
Why is that bastard 'oppa', and I'm just a 'mister'?

132
529
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,679
There's only 3 years difference between us!

133
533
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
It's only a minor difference.

134
537
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,500
If you won't call me 'oppa', call it off.

135
541
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:27,628
Turn this way.

136
545
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:35,035
How could the hotel owner hit a customer and do this damage?

137
549
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:39,406
You should have endured it. No need to show off your strength.

138
553
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,300
Your mom will be so disappointed to hear about this.

139
557
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,314
What?

140
561
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,315
Did I say something wrong again?

141
565
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,521
You think I'll misunderstand what you did earlier?

142
569
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,300
Don't worry.  Because I won't misunderstand.

143
573
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,830
Because someone shows a little kindness, that I would misunderstand,

144
577
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,032
I know too much now for that.

145
581
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,300
It was just a simple favor, right?

146
585
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:14,341
Well, you could have lost your temper.

147
589
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,200
We are  officially dating, after all.

148
593
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,400
But, I must ask you this...

149
597
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,800
When you told me to only listen to you...

150
601
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,200
was that a mistake as well?

151
605
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,706
I guess it was a mistake.

152
609
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,300
But you've been making a lot of 'mistakes' lately.

153
613
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,200
It wasn't a mistake.

154
617
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm saying it wasn't a mistake.

155
621
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,125
Seeing you talk with other men,

156
625
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,700
I don't like it.

157
629
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:10,630
I don't like you listening to other men either.

158
633
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,868
I don't know why.

159
637
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,902
I just...

160
641
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,700
dislike it.

161
645
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,348
Sorry, but...

162
649
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,600
we can't like each other.

163
653
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,700
The sixth clause says so.

164
657
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,900
We won't ever truly date.

165
661
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:52,338
Who says I like you?

166
665
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,107
Who says I want to date you?

167
669
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,045
I'm just saying that it's like that. Don't misunderstand.

168
673
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,300
You're messing with me right now, aren't you?

169
677
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,600
Why?

170
681
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Would you like it if I did love you?

171
685
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,328
No.

172
689
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,364
You were the one talking nonsense!

173
693
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:21,801
Saying not to look at other men or talk to them.
 What should one think that means?

174
698
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,637
There's nothing along those lines in the contract!

175
702
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,400
We can just write it in!

176
706
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:27,875
Hey!

177
710
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,600
Did you just speak informally again?

178
714
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,979
You're laughing?

179
718
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,481
I told you not to smirk like that in front of me.

180
722
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,116
Do you have any idea how bad it makes people feel?

181
726
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,560
You're the one always making me laugh.

182
730
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,000
When did I ever?

183
734
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,656
Do you not look in the mirror?

184
738
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,900
You're just a funny human being.

185
742
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:48,762
This little...

186
746
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:51,131
Where are the plane tickets? I'm going back to Seoul.

187
750
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,366
In my suit pocket.

188
754
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,600
Where's your suit?

189
758
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh my.

190
762
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:03,743
I'm tired. Be my pillow for a bit.

191
766
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,600
Just for a short while.

192
770
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,849
Go away. There's pillows right here!

193
774
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,418
This pillow is good.

194
778
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,153
Then use my lap. Why do you need to use my stomach?!

195
782
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,121
I said I like this pillow.

196
786
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,990
I'm insecure about it. Get off!

197
790
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,358
That's why.

198
794
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,628
The perfect pillow three ways... tension and heat settings, too!

199
798
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:31,504
Stop sucking it in. It's stiff.

200
802
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,573
They're muscles.

201
806
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:34,140
Stop sucking in.

202
810
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,677
It's my tummy and my choice.

203
814
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,880
Can you just sell this tummy to me for 50,000 dollars?

204
818
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,800
There you go, calling your dogs name again.

205
822
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,586
Whenever I see you, I can't help but laugh,

206
826
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,321
though I shouldn't.

207
830
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,556
Why shouldn't you laugh?

208
834
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,026
I don't have the right.

209
838
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,400
What right do you need to laugh?

210
842
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,500
It's something I haven't told anyone, but what will you give me if I tell?

211
846
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Very funny. Who wants to hear it?

212
850
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:14,414
What's the big mystery.  Get off of me.

213
854
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
I lent you my stomach, so hurry up and tell me.

214
858
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:29,729
I killed my older brother.

215
862
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:35,720
I killed him.

216
866
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,238
My brother,

217
870
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,373
his wife,

218
874
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,300
those I loved.

219
878
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:54,887
That day... the weather was so nice.

220
882
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,224
It was the bluest sky I had ever seen.

221
886
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:03,028
We went on a random picnic

222
890
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,998
My brother, his wife, me,

223
894
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,234
and Mi Joo

224
898
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,371
Hee Jin couldn't come because of an anatomy class.

225
902
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,040
On our way back,

226
906
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,209
my brother seemed tired.

227
910
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,112
It hadn't been long since he'd started the hotel work,

228
914
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,713
so,

229
918
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,507
I drove.

230
922
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,400
It looks like my mom's hometown is this road now.

231
926
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,800
So, are you sad?

232
930
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,300
I guess a road is just a road to be traveled on, huh?

233
934
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,000
Actually, that sounds really poetic.

234
938
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:39,306
Think so?

235
942
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,715
What? Jeju Island?

236
946
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,650
Why Jeju Island?

237
950
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,287
The boss took her for some business meeting there.

238
954
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,800
Family business getaway?

239
958
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,225
Are they coming back today?

240
962
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,260
Shouldn't they, of course?

241
966
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:07,901
Should have let me know before hand if she was going to go.

242
970
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:11,837
What does that Sam Shik think he's doing?

243
974
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,100
Ow!

244
978
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,209
Who threw that?

245
982
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,377
Oh, it hurts.

246
986
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:20,513
Oh, are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere?

247
990
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,515
Oh, hello.

248
994
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,417
I guess you came to see Sam Soon?

249
998
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,219
Did you hit me on purpose?

250
1002
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:28,188
Why would I aim for you?

251
1006
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:30,457
I should be the one getting hit.

252
1010
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,800
Well, that's a relief.

253
1014
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:36,363
Are you alright?

254
1018
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,030
Whatever, I'm fine.

255
1022
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,400
Ooh that hurts...

256
1026
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,483
Oh my.

257
1030
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:45,091
-Look here.
-What am I going to do?

258
1035
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:47,421
Put some ointment on your knee before you go.

259
1039
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:49,712
Did you dig a hole here on purpose?!

260
1043
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:52,595
You're having a fit and growing horns.

261
1047
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:53,701
The horns are coming out.

262
1051
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,941
You're so not funny.

263
1055
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I really didn't know.

264
1059
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:02,256
I can see all of your butt right now.

265
1063
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,700
See, this is worth it.

266
1067
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:32,891
So, what do you think?

267
1071
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:35,408
I think it's so tragic.

268
1075
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:37,068
What is?

269
1079
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:40,808
It's so beautiful here, you know, and she's never going  to see it.

270
1083
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:44,287
Oma   - Oma?

271
1087
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:48,080
It's funny, 'cause I...

272
1091
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,031
I know another girl who has something amazing right in front of her,

273
1095
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,200
but she can't see it either.

274
1099
00:22:56,656 --> 00:23:01,881
So what are you going to do if another girl comes along and takes him away from you?

275
1103
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,220
Huh?

276
1107
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,736
Why don't you just tell him the truth?

277
1111
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:08,054
No.   I'm not going to tell him the truth.

278
1115
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,836
Never?

279
1119
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:13,659
See you're not going to find a solution that way.  
This is a big deal.

280
1124
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:16,105
I mean, even I couldn't forgive you for that.

281
1128
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:17,584
I'm a really nice guy.

282
1132
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:21,040
So what?  I tell him that I love him,

283
1136
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,644
and if he comes back, would that be because of love?

284
1140
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:28,392
I don't know.

285
1144
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:31,543
I don't want him coming back out of sympathy.

286
1148
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,493
So what if he never comes back?

287
1152
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:36,515
Then will you take me?

288
1156
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:41,136
I'll think about it.

289
1160
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:42,907
-That's no fun. 
  - What?

290
1165
00:23:42,907 --> 00:23:47,527
In situations like this you say, "Am I your toy?"

291
1169
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:51,268
"Am I your toy?"

292
1173
00:23:51,268 --> 00:23:52,398
What's it mean?

293
1177
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:56,235
It means, don't take me for granted. I'm not for sale.

294
1181
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:57,947
Don't take me for granted.

295
1185
00:23:57,947 --> 00:24:00,144
"Am I your toy?"

296
1189
00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:02,036
"Am I your toy?"

297
1193
00:24:02,036 --> 00:24:03,835
"Am I your toy?"

298
1197
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:06,032
"Am I your toy?"

299
1201
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:09,947
"Am I your toy?"

300
1205
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,900
"Am I your toy?"

301
1209
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:21,141
And in a few weeks, she left

302
1213
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:24,421
saying that she would be back in 5 years. For sure.

303
1217
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:29,869
Like someone who'd come back from some trip.

304
1221
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:35,212
Anyway, you've been waiting for her then. With me the phony lover.

305
1225
00:24:35,212 --> 00:24:41,079
No, it's just that time has continued to flow on.

306
1229
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,695
But you didn't date other women.

307
1233
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:45,008
It was just too much trouble.

308
1237
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:47,886
You did wait for her.

309
1241
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:54,495
You did wait for her. Whether it was feelings or just time.

310
1245
00:24:54,495 --> 00:25:00,731
If one side stops loving and I quit, what does my love become?

311
1249
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:06,539
Will you start again?

312
1253
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:13,207
Even stil you love her, don't you?

313
1257
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,500
I see everything.

314
1261
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,000
You guys are very alike.

315
1265
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:23,922
Us both?

316
1269
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,900
You and Hee Jin.

317
1273
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,665
You both make me laugh.

318
1277
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,700
Have you been to Mount Halla here?

319
1281
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,588
Nope.

320
1285
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:51,909
I haven't even gone up a little mountain.

321
1289
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:56,655
I've gone twice...

322
1293
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,505
once with my brother, and

323
1297
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:01,424
once after I finished my rehabilitation.

324
1301
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,370
When I went with my brother, there was so much snow.

325
1305
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,073
My brother cleared a path through the waist-high snow.

326
1309
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:16,242
The other hikers just straggled along behind us.

327
1313
00:26:18,528 --> 00:26:22,421
When I went after finishing rehabilitation,

328
1317
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:24,283
I went on an impulse.

329
1321
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,528
"If I can just go up this mountain to the top,

330
1325
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:33,416
there won't be any problems with these battered legs in the future."

331
1329
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,200
Did you make it all the way up?

332
1333
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,384
Yeah.

333
1337
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:44,015
I cut through the clouds,

334
1341
00:26:44,015 --> 00:26:46,843
and standing at the summit,

335
1345
00:26:46,843 --> 00:26:50,603
it felt like I was standing on the clouds.

336
1349
00:26:50,603 --> 00:26:52,805
I said at that time,

337
1353
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:55,876
Now let's stop it.

338
1357
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:58,009
Both the self reproach and the resentment.

339
1361
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:04,327
I decided then

340
1365
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:10,800
to at least not show Hee Jin a pitiful state when she came back.

341
1369
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:19,599
When I came down, I made ramen

342
1373
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,989
because my brother had made ramen for me there before as well.

343
1377
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:27,352
But it wasn't the same taste.

344
1381
00:27:27,352 --> 00:27:33,200
I probably won't ever be able to eat such delicious ramen ever again.

345
1385
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:46,532
See, you make me laugh.

346
1389
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,000
I stopped eating halfway earlier.

347
1393
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:53,039
Let's go.

348
1397
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,940
Where?

349
1401
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,480
To eat ramen.

350
1405
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:02,256
Next time, if possible, lets go to Mount Halla together.

351
1409
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:19,031
Kim Sam Soon.

352
1413
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,300
Yeah?

353
1417
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,037
I mean... yes?

354
1421
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:30,280
I'm just telling you again. It's not like I've come to like you, ok?

355
1425
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,145
Don't you get what I'm saying?

356
1429
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:37,416
I told you earlier I wouldn't be confused.

357
1433
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,884
That's fine then.

358
1437
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,981
Yeah, sis?

359
1441
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,167
<i>Are you still in Jeju Island?<i></i></i>

360
1445
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,769
How'd you know?

361
1449
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,104
<i>Is Sam Shik next to you?</i>

362
1453
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,506
No, he's not, just talk. What's up?

363
1457
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,224
<i>You're coming back today, right?</i>

364
1461
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:03,841
Yeah...

365
1465
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,345
<i>You <i>definitely</i> cannot spend the night there.</i>

366
1469
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,380
Why?

367
1473
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,617
<i>What do you mean why?! Something can't happen with that guy, that's why!</i>

368
1477
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,453
What could happen?

369
1481
00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:16,987
<i>At any rate, just come back right now.</i>

370
1485
00:29:16,987 --> 00:29:19,080
Fine, got it.

371
1489
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,927
Oh, and

372
1493
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:24,697
you don't have any extra clothes at your workplace right?

373
1497
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:26,232
What workplace?

374
1501
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:27,900
Are you at the restaurant right now, sis?

375
1505
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,172
Uh... whatever, just let me know if you have any clothes at the restaurant.

376
1509
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:34,640
I didn't leave any there.

377
1513
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,177
Aw jeez.  Alright then, bye.

378
1517
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,280
Yes?

379
1521
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,782
May I come in?

380
1525
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,000
Not yet, please wait.

381
1529
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:48,221
Yes?

382
1533
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:50,556
Please open the...are you taking off your clothes?

383
1537
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:53,559
Then let me get my arm in, at least.

384
1541
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,360
Whose are these?

385
1545
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,162
They're mine, so what?

386
1549
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,699
There aren't any from other people? There are female employees too.

387
1553
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:04,236
I asked, but no one has any. 
 Are you going to wear it or not?

388
1558
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,305
And you need to return that! I've had those for ten years.

389
1562
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,817
I don't want to eat ramen.

390
1566
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,519
I thought you said you were hungry?

391
1570
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,621
Let's just head to the airport.

392
1574
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,223
Well, I'm hungry. Let's eat before we go.

393
1578
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:28,060
Then eat on your own. I'm going to go first.

394
1582
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:49,855
How'd you come all the way here?

395
1586
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:52,351
Yes... because I received an invitation.

396
1590
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,000
Is that Mr. Right?

397
1594
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,738
We need to talk.

398
1598
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:13,806
I have nothing to say to you.

399
1602
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:14,607
It'll only be a moment.

400
1606
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:16,509
Your boyfriend might not like that.

401
1610
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:17,610
He's just a friend.

402
1614
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,300
I don't care.

403
1618
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,082
How can you do this to me?

404
1622
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,800
Come.

405
1626
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,600
Please don't go.

406
1630
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:34,426
Let go of him.

407
1634
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,229
I can't. You let go.

408
1638
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
--You let go. 
 --YOU let go.

409
1643
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,867
And as for you,

410
1647
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,204
Don't look at other women.

411
1651
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:49,142
Listen only to me, only look at me.

412
1655
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:54,646
Let's go.

413
1659
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,515
It'll only be a moment.

414
1663
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,717
Do you really want to get hit?

415
1667
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,252
Let go when I'm asking nicely.

416
1671
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,003
Just for a bit. It won't take long.

417
1675
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:06,758
No. I don't want him to even for a minute or second.

418
1679
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,744
If you go now, it's over between us.

419
1683
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,300
Jin Hyun!

420
1687
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,500
Come on.

421
1691
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:51,637
Where do you want to go?

422
1695
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,339
To the airport.

423
1699
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:55,248
I thought you said you wanted ramen.

424
1703
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,770
Driver, please stop here.

425
1707
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,517
You leave first.

426
1711
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:42,287
Driver, please take her to the airport.

427
1715
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,757
Hey, Jin Hyun!

428
1719
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,471
Ahjussi, please let me off here as well.

429
1723
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,203
Just a second!

430
1727
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:33,806
Don't go.

431
1731
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:41,013
What are you doing right now?

432
1735
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:42,949
Don't go. I have something to tell you!

433
1739
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,684
Tell me later.

434
1743
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:51,924
I'm saying I've come to like you.

435
1747

Hello.

454
1826
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:26,879
Hee Jin, I know she's inside.

455
1830
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:29,882
Yeah.  She's inside.  Go ahead.

456
1834
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:55,774
That's my friend Henry.  You should greet him.

457
1838
00:37:55,774 --> 00:38:00,512
Hi.  I'm Henry. Nice to meet you.

458
1842
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:04,083
She and I have to talk. In private.

459
1846
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,652
Okay. I'll leave you guys.

460
1850
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:10,088
No.  You shouldn't have to go.

461
1854
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:14,427
Henry is like my other half. No need to send him out.

462
1858
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:24,704
You went to study... and you come back with that guy?

463
1862
00:38:24,704 --> 00:38:28,574
Is that as far as your imagination goes?
Try to write more interesting fiction.

464
1867
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:29,709
Send that guy out first.

465
1871
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:32,077
You talk first. Why are you here?

466
1875
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:35,446
The real reason you left. Tell me.

467
1879
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,183
'Studying' abroad was just an excuse, wasn't it?

468
1883
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:38,518
Yes.

469
1887
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:40,619
Did my mom do something?

470
1891
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:41,520
That's not it.

471
1895
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,022
Then what is it!

472
1899
00:38:43,022 --> 00:38:47,427
Why are you so curious?
You have a girlfriend to bring to official places.

473
1904
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:52,064
If I'd known you brought her here, 
I wouldn't have come.

474
1909
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:56,535
But, now it really seems like the end.

475
1913
00:38:56,535 --> 00:39:00,473
That's all I wanted to say earlier. 
To tell you guys to be happy.

476
1918
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:01,499
Tell me why you left.

477
1922
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:03,709
No, I won't tell you.

478
1926
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:07,346
I'm going to make you wonder forever,
make you regret it forever!

479
1931
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,615
That's my revenge for your distrust in me.

480
1935
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,652
Calm down.

481
1939
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,988
You need to calm down.

482
1943
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:17,090
Hee Jin was very sick.

483
1947
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,091
Henry stop!

484
1951
00:39:18,091 --> 00:39:19,592
I am her doctor.

485
1955
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:20,361
Stop it!

486
1959
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:27,932
Don't tell him! That's not helping me out any.

487
1963
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,301
Get out.

488
1967
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:32,070
Hurry up and get out.

489
1971
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,708
Get out!

490
1975
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,509
Get out!

491
1979
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:42,314
She has AGC.  Advanced Gastric Cancer.

492
1983
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:49,954
I removed almost all of her stomach.

493
1987
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:54,827
So she should not be stressed, and you should not be yelling at her, okay?

494
1991
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,500
Is it true?

495
1995
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,900
Answer me.

496
1999
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,790
Why?

497
2003
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,580
Why didn't you tell me?

498
2007
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,141
Why didn't? Why?!

499
2011
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:46,010
How could I tell you?
 How?

500
2016
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:50,882
Why not? You could have said you would be back after getting a surgery.

501
2020
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:53,252
How could I do so, when you're going through such a hard time?

502
2024
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,800
You're tied up with your situation. Then, how could I tell you?

503
2028
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,896
I'm sorry I thought...

504
2032
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:07,467
It would be okay.

505
2036
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:10,520
I thought everything is going to be fine.

506
2040
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,572
I'm sorry.

507
2044
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,800
I'm so sorry...

508
2048
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,272
Gee, those pigs smell really bad.

509
2052
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:51,378
Who is this?

510
2056
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:52,178
Hello?

511
2060
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:54,212
Where's Jin Hyun?

512
2064
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,482
Yes, Mother.

513
2068
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:59,752
I'm not your mother yet. Don't call me like that. I asked you. Where is Jin Hyun?

514
2072
00:41:59,752 --> 00:42:02,455
He's out on business.

515
2076
00:42:02,455 --> 00:42:06,623
The flight time is almost up. Where is he? He didn't even answer the phone!

516
2080
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:13,266
I think you'd better go first, I think it's going to take longer than I expected. He's going to be late.

517
2084
00:42:13,266 --> 00:42:16,368
Late? Why?  What is he doing?

518
2088
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:21,307
I'm afraid I don't know exactly.

519
2092
00:42:21,307 --> 00:42:24,176
I heard that you got into a fight with Chae Ri's fiancee earlier. Is that true?

520
2096
00:42:24,176 --> 00:42:26,044
What?

521
2100
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,881
No, it's not that…

522
2104
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:31,751
But, why is it so noisy over there? Are you catching pigs or something?

523
2108
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:35,121
Um... it's a...

524
2112
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:38,891
Why are you hesitating? Just spit it out!

525
2116
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:43,963
Sorry.

526
2120
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,800
That's enough!

527
2124
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:56,876
Excuse me, Sir, but since you're already giving me a ride, could you please drop me off in front of the hotel? Please?

528
2128
00:42:56,876 --> 00:43:01,581
My toes are all swollen, and I can't run with these heels.

529
2132
00:43:02,815 --> 00:43:09,454
I'm sorry that I didn't talk to them much. I thought I would see them again.

530
2136
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:11,591
What's the difference? We wouldn't talk to them for long, anyway.

531
2140
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:13,759
Why are you so grumpy?

532
2144
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:16,628
I don't like anything about her.

533
2148
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:19,999
She's old. Her family is not well off…
Where on earth did he find such a girl?

534
2153
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:24,603
I thought you've matured. You should get up earlier in the morning.

535
2157
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,342
Yes, yes.

536
2161
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:35,848
I want to postpone my scheduled flight. 
 I'd like to change it to the last flight.

537
2166
00:43:37,183 --> 00:43:41,154
Okay, well yes.

538
2170
00:43:41,154 --> 00:43:42,588
Thank you very much.

539
2174
00:44:24,797 --> 00:44:26,798
Hello.

540
2178
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:30,280
Can you speak Korean?

541
2182
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:31,904
Korean?

542
2186
00:44:31,904 --> 00:44:33,706
Oh, you can!

543
2190
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:37,910
Do you happen to know where my boss is.  
The man I was with.

544
2195
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,300
The man who came with me! My boyfriend.

545
2199
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,500
You can't speak Korean?

546
2203
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:53,092
You should have learned some...

547
2207
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:59,197
What's your name?

548
2211
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,266
I'm Henry Kim.

549
2215
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:05,137
Oh, Henry! My name is Sa––

550
2219
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:07,740
My name is Sophie!

551
2223
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,174
Sophie?

552
2227
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:12,778
Can you speak French?

553
2231
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:14,046
No.

554
2235
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:17,616
My name is Sophie.

555
2239
00:45:17,616 --> 00:45:21,387
I can't speak English.

556
2243
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:25,524
And you can't speak French.

557
2247
00:45:25,524 --> 00:45:27,927
We're the same, aren't we?

558
2251
00:45:30,629 --> 00:45:34,098
You don't understand, right?

559
2255
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:37,036
You... boyfriend?

560
2259
00:45:40,706 --> 00:45:45,511
You, ah... Hee Jin, Hee Jin is your girlfriend?

561
2263
00:45:45,511 --> 00:45:47,680
No, just friends.

562
2267
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,081
Ah, no girlfriend?

563
2271
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:50,716
No, just friends.

564
2275
00:45:50,716 --> 00:45:52,119
Ah, just friend...

565
2279
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:53,390
Yeah!

566
2283
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,920
Yeah.

567
2287
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,824
You know my boyfriend?

568
2291
00:45:57,824 --> 00:46:00,460
Your boyfriend, Mr. Hyun?

569
2295
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,095
Yes, Mr. Hyun!

570
2299
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,663
Yes, he's in the room.

571
2303
00:46:03,663 --> 00:46:06,837
Room? Yeah.

572
2307
00:46:06,837 --> 00:46:09,235
Same room... together?

573
2311
00:46:09,235 --> 00:46:11,804
Hee Jin's room, together?

574
2315
00:46:12,972 --> 00:46:15,307
Oh my god!

575
2319
00:46:15,307 --> 00:46:18,845
No! Oh, no no no...

576
2323
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,200
What's the room number?

577
2327
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,200
What are you pulling? Quickly tell me. 
Tell me the room number!

578
2332
00:46:30,256 --> 00:46:34,827
Now, your girlfriend and my boyfriend are together! We should take them apart!

579
2336
00:46:34,827 --> 00:46:35,862
Are you crazy?

580
2340
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:37,530
Crazy?

581
2344
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,099
Yes, I'm crazy.

582
2348
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,700
I'm about to lose my boyfriend. How can I stay calm?!

583
2352
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:48,374
Okay, I can figure it out on my own!

584
2356
00:46:48,374 --> 00:46:51,575
Wait, wait!

585
2360
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:52,945
Sit, come one, sit.

586
2364
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:54,647
Are you going to tell me the number?

587
2368
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,200
If I sit down, will you tell me the room number?

588
2372
00:47:02,922 --> 00:47:04,757
This is just vitamin pills.

589
2376
00:47:04,757 --> 00:47:07,759
Don't worry.

590
2380
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:11,596
One is for iron, the other is for digestion.

591
2384
00:47:11,596 --> 00:47:14,733
Now, I don't need digestive medicine anymore.

592
2388
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,500
I bring them with me just in case.

593
2392
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:23,841
What is that scar on your face?

594
2396
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,445
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

595
2400
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,700
This won't do. I shall put medicine on it.

596
2404
00:47:34,086 --> 00:47:37,222
I'm okay. I applied it already.

597
2408
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:40,560
I've got a magical medicine.

598
2412
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,629
that will heal your bruise immediately.

599
2416
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,100
Here's another one.

600
2420
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,800
You're embarrassing me. Please, smile.

601
2424
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,000
Any other bruises?

602
2428
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,339
You seem to have lost a lot of weight.

603
2432
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:35,347
Actually, I've regained it a lot.

604
2436
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:40,719
I lost 10 killograms when I was going through chemo theraphy after the surgery.

605
2440
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:43,121
I was like a kangaroo.

606
2444
00:48:48,691 --> 00:48:53,065
When did you find out?

607
2448
00:48:53,065 --> 00:48:58,904
Remember I used to tell you I kept on getting indigestion?

608
2452
00:48:58,904 --> 00:49:02,506
Yes, you said you felt nauseated.

609
2456
00:49:04,576 --> 00:49:10,948
I thought I got pregnant, so I bought a pregnancy tester.

610
2460
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,885
The day you had an accident I received a diagnosis.

611
2464
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,927
I lied to you that I had an autopsy class.

612
2468
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:26,332
While waiting for you to wake up in the ward,

613
2472
00:49:26,332 --> 00:49:31,602
I worried so much.

614
2476
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:35,006
I wasn't sure if I should tell you the truth.

615
2480
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:38,243
I thought how you'd react, if I told you?

616
2484
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:42,915
And when you would recover?

617
2488
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:49,856
Who's more miserable, you or me?

618
2492
00:49:54,293 --> 00:49:57,363
Then, I decided not to tell.

619
2496
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:02,368
Never do that again.

620
2500
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:10,109
Survival rate was only 35%.

621
2504
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:14,479
I cried so hard on the airplane.

622
2508
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:18,251
The chance I could come back was 35%.

623
2512
00:50:20,653 --> 00:50:24,355
The chance I would never see you again was

624
2516
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,592
65%.

625
2520
00:50:32,131 --> 00:50:33,900
Am I great?

626
2524
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,103
I survived the slim chance.

627
2528
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,783
Thank you for surviving.

628
2532
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,492
For my entire life

629
2536
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,700
you just said the most touching words.

630
2540
00:51:11,466 --> 00:51:18,343
You're so good. What can I do?

631
2544
00:51:18,343 --> 00:51:21,413
I give up.

632
2548
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,800
You win!

633
2552
00:51:31,851 --> 00:51:33,859
Do you like tea?

634
2556
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,700
I do.

635
2560
00:51:36,562 --> 00:51:38,964
Do you like Madeleine?

636
2564
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,900
Madeleine?

637
2568
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,140
This is Madeleine.

638
2572
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,575
Madeleine.

639
2576
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:51,443
French cookie.

640
2580
00:51:56,913 --> 00:52:00,019
Madeleine, this...

641
2584
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:05,958
Dip it in the tea like this. Watch.

642
2588
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:09,695
Dip it, and bite into it.

643
2592
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,800
Bite.

644
2596
00:52:15,568 --> 00:52:18,637
My job is a patissier.

645
2600
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:20,873
Patissier?

646
2604
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,300
No, patissier.

647
2608
00:52:24,944 --> 00:52:28,725
How can I say in English?

648
2612
00:52:28,725 --> 00:52:29,815
Ah, baker.

649
2616
00:52:29,815 --> 00:52:31,217
Baker? You're a baker?

650
2620
00:52:31,217 --> 00:52:34,120
I'm a baker, great! You're right.

651
2624
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,988
I love bakers.

652
2628
00:52:35,988 --> 00:52:37,456
Thank you.

653
2632
00:52:37,456 --> 00:52:42,161
This madeleine is

654
2636
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:47,333
the most famous cookie in France.

655
2640
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,737
Wow, my English is good today.

656
2644
00:52:51,737 --> 00:52:53,838
Hmm...

657
2648
00:52:53,900 --> 00:53:00,200
You know "À la recherche du temps perdu?"

658
2652
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,300
You don't?

659
2656
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:09,400
In English, the title is:
What is it called?

660
2661
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,700
"Looking for time."

661
2665
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,961
French book.

662
2669
00:53:15,961 --> 00:53:18,630
Marcel Proust.

663
2673
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:22,501
Marcel Proust, "In Search of Lost Time."

664
2677
00:53:22,501 --> 00:53:27,840
Yes, that's right, "In Search of Lost Time."

665
2681
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,943
I heard about it, but I haven't read it yet.

666
2685
00:53:30,943 --> 00:53:33,546
I have no idea what you're talking about.

667
2689
00:53:33,546 --> 00:53:38,584
Anyway, Madeleine appears in the book.

668
2693
00:53:38,584 --> 00:53:43,889
The main character of the book eats Madeleine with tea and remembers the past.

669
2697
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:48,493
The main character describes this Madeleine like this,

670
2701
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:54,831
"Chubby, sexy, but a little wrinkled."

671
2705
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,836
I don't know how to say...

672
2709
00:54:00,439 --> 00:54:01,974
Um, okay, like this.

673
2713
00:54:01,974 --> 00:54:06,144
He said,

674
2717
00:54:06,144 --> 00:54:08,513
This is

675
2721
00:54:08,513 --> 00:54:10,549
sexy cookie.

676
2725
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,886
Sexy cookie?

677
2729
00:54:13,886 --> 00:54:17,021
Right.

678
2733
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:18,658
My French lecturer told me

679
2737
00:54:18,658 --> 00:54:23,098
instead of the madeleine, I should have a brioche and French pastry made with choux.

680
2741
00:54:23,098 --> 00:54:29,635
Because I was in France, I bought the book, but It's so difficult that I got frustrated after a few chapters.

681
2745
00:54:29,635 --> 00:54:30,436
Hmm...

682
2749
00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:37,376
Well, Henry.

683
2753
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:44,850
Now, the two are

684
2757
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:50,057
searching their lost time as in the book?

685
2761
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:52,759
Right? Right?

686
2765
00:55:00,562 --> 00:55:02,601
I...

687
2769
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:06,338
I did many bad things to Henry.

688
2773
00:55:06,338 --> 00:55:10,942
I cried, yelled at him, and even hit him,

689
2777
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:14,946
While seeing my ugly side,

690
2781
00:55:14,946 --> 00:55:19,750
he didn't even make a face.

691
2785
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:26,959
I did everything to get him to leave and come back to you.

692
2789
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:36,335
Don't worry. Now, I'm with you.

693
2793
00:55:39,572 --> 00:55:44,575
Hello, go straight, please.

694
2797
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:46,478
Hello.

695
2801
00:55:46,478 --> 00:55:49,981
Go straight, please.

696
2805
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:52,684
Go straight, please.

697
2809
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:55,519
Hello?

698
2813
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,990
Hello?

699
2817
00:56:23,148 --> 00:56:28,853
Thank you for telling me earlier about your brother.

700
2821
00:56:28,853 --> 00:56:33,691
I was going to tell you about my father.

701
2825
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:39,097
My father was a miller.

702
2829
00:56:39,097 --> 00:56:42,867
I couldn't go to his funeral.

703
2833
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:48,839
It was so sudden that I couldn't get a flight ticket

704
2837
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,877
I saw him last,

705
2841
00:56:51,877 --> 00:56:58,415
at the Kimpo Airport. That time, the Incheon Airport wasn't opened yet.

706
2845
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:03,856
He brought a big bunch of rice cakes for me.

707
2849
00:57:03,856 --> 00:57:08,427
But, I got angry with him.

708
2853
00:57:08,427 --> 00:57:11,997
I told him no one eats rice cake these days.

709
2857
00:57:13,732 --> 00:57:15,100
But,

710
2861
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:19,530
If I'd known it was the last time,

711
2865
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,080
I would have told him, "Thank you!"

712
2869
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,900
"Good bye, take care."

713
2873
00:57:30,048 --> 00:57:35,354
I should have said that.

714
2877
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,232
Thanks again for telling me about your brother.

715
2881
00:57:47,232 --> 00:57:50,702
I really appreciate it.

716
2885
00:57:50,702 --> 00:57:53,272
Thank you.

717
2889
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:18,531
Excuse me?

718
2893
00:58:18,531 --> 00:58:21,300
Which way is to Mt. Halla from here?

719
2897
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,903
This way.

720
2901
00:58:23,903 --> 00:58:25,204
Thank you.

721
2905
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:46,758
Father,

722
2909
00:58:46,758 --> 00:58:49,862
why is love always so tough for me?

723
2913
00:58:49,862 --> 00:58:52,264
Father, tell me why.

724
2917
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,300
