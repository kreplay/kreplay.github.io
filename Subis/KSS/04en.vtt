Love is Supposed to be Childish</i>

00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:14,624
Foot.

3
12
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:16,597
Foot... foot.

4
16
00:00:16,597 --> 00:00:17,899
I got you today.

5
20
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:21,668
You made fun of me for getting drunk all the time? 
You'll get it now.

6
25
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:23,476
Scared me.

7
29
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,796
Give me your foot.
Why does this punk keep moving?

8
34
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:50,633
This punk!  Hey!

9
38
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:56,628
I got hurt.  You'll get it from me when you wake up.

10
42
00:00:56,628 --> 00:00:59,789
I'm letting you off this time cause you're drunk.

11
46
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:03,501
Oh, my back, oh, my back.

12
50
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:09,895
Here ... this way ... this way.
Oh my!

13
55
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,880
Are you asleep? Are you?

14
59
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:36,847
You sure  have weird drinking habits.

15
63
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,365
Dear God!

16
67
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:02,657
Please don't let me fall into temptation.

17
71
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:06,167
How can there be sexual assault in Sam Soon's life?

18
75
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,400
I beg of you.  Please.

19
79
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:12,683
Hee Jin.

20
83
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,680
Hee Jin.

21
87
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:26,100
Hee Jin? Which Hee Jin?

22
91
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,252
Kim Hee Jin or Yoo Hee Jin?

23
95
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,400
Don't confuse me and say it clearly.

24
99
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,980
Why won't you answer me?

25
103
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:11,723
Locking yourself in here, are you waiting for her?

26
107
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:39,280
I've hungered for a long time.

27
111
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,340
If you do this, it scares me.

28
115
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,360
<i>These chocolates look delicious. Why don't we buy some?</i>

29
119
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,830
<i>Ya. Let's buy some for the kids.</i>

30
123
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,010
<i>They're even on sale today.</i>

31
127
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,300
<i>Only 99 cents per pound. 
 That's a very good price.</i>

32
132
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,490
<i>Let's buy three pounds.
 Good idea.</i>

33
137
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,500
<i>Oh, let's save some.
 Who said we are almost out of it?</i>

34
142
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:22,843
<i>You're acting crazy, totally crazy.</i>

35
146
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:28,267
<i>What do you think you're doing?
The ink on your licenses aren't even dried yet! </i>

36
151
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,500
<i>You wretch! You didn't hear me?</i>

37
155
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,400
Are you awake?

38
159
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:53,205
Get up now.  We have to eat before going to work.

39
163
00:05:56,742 --> 00:06:00,440
Drop the innocent act.
Why are you looking so shocked?

40
168
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,759
I found rice so I made rice and egg soup.

41
172
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,232
There are only eggs in your fridge.

42
176
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:09,933
What happened?

43
180
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:15,023
Your drunk habits are pretty bad too.
Hurry up!

44
185
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:20,840
Gosh, it's tiring.

45
189
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,472
I don't have much of an appetite.

46
193
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:32,379
Imagine your mouth as a trash bag and dump it in.

47
197
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:36,375
How ... did you bring me back here?

48
201
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,054
At the restaurant, the cab driver helped me.

49
205
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:41,485
Over here, the security ahjussi carried you up.

50
209
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:45,253
The security ahjussi  has a spare key to your apartment.

51
213
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:54,415
You're going to lose your blessing.  Stuff it in!

52
217
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:07,374
Does it taste good?

53
221
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:10,195
It's too bland.

54
225
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:14,354
There's no salt, so I boiled the water
 that I washed my face with.

55
230
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:24,586
Maybe I should've washed my feet too.
Then, the flavor would have been perfect.

56
235
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:31,673
Did you really spend the night here?

57
239
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:35,237
Then did you think I went  home and came back 
in the morning to make this egg soup?

58
244
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,797
Why should I?

59
248
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:42,173
And you were clinging onto me so I wouldn't leave.

60
252
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:43,189
You don't remember?

61
256
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:46,144
Me? Why?

62
260
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:48,070
Why?

63
264
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,806
That's something I want to ask.
Why did you do that?

64
269
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:56,488
You really don't remember?

65
273
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:05,784
Getting drunk and blacking out is ... fine.

66
277
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:09,654
But how could you be so into girls?

67
281
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:13,166
You were bothering me all night.

68
285
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:16,863
I couldn't even sleep a wink.

69
289
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:20,353
I'm so tired now.  My neck is sore.

70
293
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:29,100
What should we do?  What do we do?

71
297
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,198
Isn't it your mother?

72
301
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:34,665
What should we do?

73
305
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:42,178
Isn't it your mum? It is right?

74
309
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:01,209
I have something to tell you.

75
313
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:04,362
There's something you don't know.

76
317
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:06,653
I'll explain why I did what I did.

77
321
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:10,131
You weren't the only one in pain.
I was too...

78
326
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,443
Cake...?

79
330
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:35,499
Say it. What you came to say.

80
334
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,990
What is it you have to say?

81
338
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,763
Sorry, there's something the two of us need to talk about.
What?

82
343
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:06,731
Then, go ahead and talk.

83
347
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,288
Don't go.

84
351
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:14,817
She's my girlfriend.

85
355
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:21,632
Go ahead and say it when we're together.

86
359
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:25,684
I don't want to see other women
behind my girlfriend's back

You like her, don't you?

92
384
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:10,633
Aren't you pretending to date me,
so you can wait for her to come back?

93
389
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:12,912
It's none of your business.

94
393
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:15,575
I don't want to care either.

95
397
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,214
But what is this? You made me into a fool!

96
401
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:21,032
I told you not to butt in!

97
405
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,368
Doing that is so cruel to a woman!

98
409
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:30,241
Do you know how hurt she'll be?

99
413
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:32,634
Hey! Go after her!

100
417
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:34,615
She said she has something to tell you!

101
421
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,781
Shut up!

102
425
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:40,290
Do you know how cruel that woman was?!

437
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,076
Then let's break the contract.

106
441
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:04,005
There's nothing in the contract
that says you can use me for your love-problem!

107
446
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:06,167
Whatever!

108
450
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:10,128
What a Jerk!

117

00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:28,433
It's a passing thing.  It'll pass soon.

118
492
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:00,376
Don't move that.

119
496
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:02,406
You, come with me.

120
500
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:27,017
Try some of this. It's too good.

121
504
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:31,055
Which table is this?

122
508
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:33,265
Table B3.

123
512
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:14,454
Move over.

124
516
00:15:20,826 --> 00:15:22,710
Watch me.

125
520
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,379
When the batter doubles in size, brush on the 
egg wash, and put it in the oven.

126
525
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:41,485
What's the oven temperature?

127
529
00:15:41,485 --> 00:15:42,574
230 degrees.

128
533
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,785
-For how long?
-15 minutes.

129
538
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:49,658
And when you're cutting it, you have to do it  in one stroke.
If not, the shape will change.

130
543
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,148
I know, but I just can't do it right.

131
547
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:56,922
Practice and you'll get better.
 I'll check up on you next week.

132
552
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,477
Don't burn it.

133
556
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:06,317
-Who's in charge of soup today?
-That's me.

134
561
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:11,390
Look at this. The water is boiling, isn't it?
Do it again.  And put in the beef.

135
566
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:14,865
Hurry up with it.

136
570
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,724
What are you doing?

137
574
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:23,447
See that? Now do right.  Do it right!

138
578
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,487
What?

139
582
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,121
Let's have lunch.

140
586
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:32,690
Put this away!

141
590
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:38,368
I was right.  I told you that his dark circles
 are getting worse so we should be careful.

142
595
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:41,699
Hey fool.  Do you think just being careful will work?

143
599
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,802
The atmosphere is really bad.
It should blow up or something.

144
604
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:48,234
-Please clear this.
-Yes.

145
609
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:57,019
She didn't come home last night,
and her phone is still turned off.

146
614
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:01,533
So where's Sam Shik?

147
618
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,454
Hey... Hey.

148
622
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,974
Is this from Table B3?

149
626
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:14,554
What a strange woman. Why come to
a restaurant when you're not eating?

150
631
00:17:23,782 --> 00:17:26,527
This is really good.

151
635
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,022
-I didn't order this.
-I know.

152
640
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:48,099
I noticed that you didn't touch your
dessert, so I made you something special.

153
645
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:49,999
Are you the chef?

154
649
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:52,543
Yes, excuse me.

155
653
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:58,278
I'm the head chef, Lee Hyung Woo.

156
657
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:03,275
I check if the customer leaves more than half on their plate.

157
661
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,517
I don't like crepes.

158
665
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:14,325
You barely touched the steak you ordered.

159
669
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:16,913
That...

160
673
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:19,741
Do I have to explain that?

161
677
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:20,979
No.

162
681
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:26,005
But if you don't mind, we'd love
your feedback, so we can improve...

163
686
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,413
Anyway, I didn't eat it all because I'm on a diet.
And take this too.

164
691
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:33,703
I don't eat flour products while I'm dieting.

165
695
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,417
I've just said it.

166
699
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:46,116
This is not just any crepe. It's done according to how crepes were made when it was first introduced.

167
703
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:47,977
It's something that's hard to taste now days?

168
707
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:51,704
But I don't like crepes.

169
711
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,761
How can you not like crepes?

170
715
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:17,803
What?

171
719
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:23,129
How can you not like such
sweet, fragrant, and soft crepes?

172
724
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,148
Hey, mister...

173
728
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:29,001
So because of dieting, you're giving up
the chance to taste a crepe of this caliber?

174
733
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,087
Miss, is there something wrong with your head?

175
737
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,577
-What did you say?
-Oh yes, diet!  Diet!

176
742
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:37,219
So you can flaunt your body.

177
746
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:41,062
Does it make sense to give up on the chance to try a crepe 
that you can taste maybe once in your lifetime?

178
751
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:43,655
Mister, you're really...

179
755
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:45,612
Eat it.

180
759
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,193
-First, eat it.

181
763
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:52,493
I won't eat this.
You eat it yourself

182
768
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:56,626
Eat it!

183
772
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:59,562
-He finally exploded.
-It's better this way.

184
777
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:03,826
I knew something was going to happen
when he said he was going to make a special crepe.

185
782
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:06,626
She's not backing down either.

186
786
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:12,307
Are you President Bush, or something?

187
790
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:14,416
I'm going to avoid it today.

188
794
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:18,791
Where are you going? Eat it. Eat it before you go.

189
798
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:22,781
I'm trying to live peacefully, 
but you're not cooperating!

190
803
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:25,595
-Let go of my hand
-Okay, okay.

191
808
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:31,478
I'm letting go, but first you have to eat this.

192
812
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:33,813
Director Lee, what is going on?

193
816
00:20:33,813 --> 00:20:38,485
Supervisor Lee, come to your senses.  It's business hours.
And this is the front hall!

194
821
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,524
Where's Head Chef Lee?

195
825
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:54,776
Our Head Chef Lee? He's having a fight

196
829
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,280
What's this?

197
833
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:04,311
Sam Soon, you be careful too.

198
837
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:06,804
Mister, you're really... I won't eat it.

199
841
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:10,679
-Eat it! I said eat it!
-I'm not eating!

200
846
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:23,278
Unnie!

201
850
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:27,563
Unnie! What are you doing here?

202
854
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:34,979
Boss, what are you doing there?

203
858
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:41,014
Hold it! I haven't taken a good look at him yet.

204
862
00:21:41,014 --> 00:21:43,467
He's good looking.
Good looking.

205
867
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:46,358
What kind of embarrassment is this at someone else's workplace?  You didn't even call first!

206
871
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:48,042
It wasn't my fault.

207
875
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:51,415
That flat face chef couldn't hold his own temper.

208
879
00:21:51,415 --> 00:21:54,764
I can see how it went down. 
You must've really provoked him.

209
884
00:21:54,764 --> 00:21:57,942
What about you? 
Why did you turn off your handphone?

210
889
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,278
Why didn't you come home last night?

211
893
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,238
Where were you last night?

212
897
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,239
Is Mom angry?

213
901
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,079
What did you do?

214
905
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,170
-Don't ask.
-You were with a guy?

215
910
00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:11,018
-No
-Your expression says it all

216
915
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:14,494
Who is it? Do you really have a boyfriend?

217
919
00:22:14,494 --> 00:22:17,296
No!  Just go.

218
923
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:23,229
Is it Sam Shik?  
You were with Sam Shik, right?

219
928
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:28,162
Gosh! You are something.

220
932
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:30,266
Come on, tell me. What did you guys do?

221
936
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,652
Do what?

222
940
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,178
We just slept.

223
944
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:41,277
Not that kind! 
Just sleeping, this kind of sleeping.

224
949
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,430
Are you guys really dating?

225
953
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,308
It's not like that.

226
957
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:47,579
Anyway, our boss has a girlfriend.

227
961
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,378
Girlfriend?

228
965
00:22:49,378 --> 00:22:52,701
If he has a girlfriend, why is he pretending to date you?

229
969
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:55,798
How would I know?
Whatever!

230
974
00:22:57,682 --> 00:23:01,533
The two of them...
they're really dating?

231
979
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:07,529
Gosh, don't be like this. I was wrong.

232
983
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:10,084
I don't care what you do in the kitchen.

233
987
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:12,961
But I'm responsible for the front hall.

234
991
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:14,259
Never seen a mob movie?

235
995
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,930
How could you mess with someone else's territory?

236
999
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,994
As an elder, but I failed to teach you well.

237
1003
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:23,082
I should take the blame. I'll do the dishes for a week.

238
1007
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:27,967
I beg you, please. I won't do it again

239
1011
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,668
You said the same thing last time.

240
1015
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:33,159
No... I'm sincere this time.

241
1019
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,934
If I get even near the hall again,
then I'm a son of a b***h.

242
1024
00:23:39,408 --> 00:23:42,827
Why are you guys standing there? Come on and help.

243
1028
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:44,949
Manager Lee, let's get out.

244
1032
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:49,195
Let go of me.

245
1036
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,379
<i>You guys!</i>

246
1040
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:59,751
I really need to calm my temper down.

247
1044
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:03,098
What are you looking at?
Get over here and do the dishes.

248
1049
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:25,398
Did you go see Hee Jin?

249
1053
00:24:27,443 --> 00:24:31,636
Go meet her. When you meet her, 
apologize for  what happened in the morning.

250
1058
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,661
Explain to her that there's nothing between us.

251
1062
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:36,681
Being in the middle puts me in an awkward position.

252
1066
00:24:37,714 --> 00:24:40,004
You were too much this morning.

253
1070
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:47,360
You were being a coward, crude, ... and cruel.

254
1074
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:51,338
What kind of a woman are you?

255
1078
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,781
What? You?

256
1082
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:55,680
Don't you have anything better to do?

257
1086
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,113
How dare you talk down on me?

258
1090
00:24:58,113 --> 00:24:59,443
I told you not to meddle in this.

259
1094
00:24:59,443 --> 00:25:01,293
Then don't use me like that.

260
1098
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:02,794
Who's the one that made me into a fool?

261
1102
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,824
I will cooperate in all matters.
Don't you remember Clause 2?

262
1107
00:25:05,824 --> 00:25:07,953
I said I'd cooperate, but did I say you can use me?

263
1111
00:25:07,953 --> 00:25:10,549
-You should have said so earlier.
-Are you really going to act like this?

264
1116
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:13,890
-So, I told you not to provoke me!
-Who started the provoking?

265
1121
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:18,077
If you're going to be in a relationship, then
do it quietly.
Why are you dragging me into this?

266
1127
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:19,940
Are you wielding power because you're in a relationship?

267
1131
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,917
Do you want to brag that you're in a lover's quarrel?

268
1135
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:25,050
It's not even funny.

269
1139
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,020
Who hasn't been in love?

270
1143
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,308
Love is love. 
Why are you being so peculiar?

271
1148
00:25:31,308 --> 00:25:34,199
It's so disgusting. I can't even watch this.

272
1152
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,512
If you're going to be like this let's just terminate the contract!

273
1156
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,731
Sure, terminate it.

274
1160
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:38,911
Fine, terminate it.

275
1164
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:41,835
From now on, we've never signed any contract, but...

276
1168
00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:44,527
Pay back $50,000 right now.

277
1172
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:03,470
You have a dog for a pet?

278
1176
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,718
Your dog's named 50 grand?

279
1180
00:26:05,718 --> 00:26:09,149
To you, 50 grand might be nothing, but it's not for me.

280
1184
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:13,265
My dad worked his entire life for that house. 
But it may disappear because of the money.

281
1189
00:26:13,265 --> 00:26:14,533
Forget $50,000,

282
1193
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,908
Some people kill themselves over $5000.

283
1197
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,460
But what about you? Did you make that money?

284
1201
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,551
You're living in luxury because of your rich parents.
There's nothing great about you!

285
1206
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:30,018
I'm penniless. Do whatever you want!

286
1210
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:34,955
I don't have the money now.
You can terminate it when I have money.

287
1215
00:26:34,955 --> 00:26:38,230
So, don't use me the way you did this morning.

288
1219
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,974
But instead, I won't butt in your affairs.

289
1223
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,816
According to the contract, I can cooperate.

290
1227
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,471
If I feel like crap, I'll call it, 'use,' 
and if not, I'll call it, 'cooperation'.

291
1232
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,340
Do you understand?

292
1236
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,969
And you...

293
1240
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:53,935
Don't dare get informal with men once more.

294
1244
00:26:53,935 --> 00:26:57,811
Then I might kill you.  Got that?

295
1248
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:00,428
We're not done.

296
1252
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,231
You have to pay for the vase.

297
1256
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:07,571
Don't worry.  I'll buy you the exact same one.

298
1260
00:27:07,571 --> 00:27:09,460
Flowers too.

299
1264
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:12,465
Okay!!

300
1268
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,722
Do you even know flowers?

301
1272
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,756
What are you guys looking at? Eat your food.

302
1276
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,720
Sorry about it.

303
1280
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,945
I was rude to your sister.

304
1284
00:27:41,945 --> 00:27:45,026
That's okay. 
My sister didn't do anything right either.

305
1289
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:49,563
How can leave so much food when there are people starving everywhere at an expensive restaurant like this.

306
1293
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:51,848
Does that even make sense?

307
1297
00:27:51,848 --> 00:27:53,922
True.

308
1301
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:56,921
Thank you.

309
1305
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:03,362
Here you go.

310
1309
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:08,911
Aren't you a formal employee now?
 Give that to the newbie.

311
1314
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:10,916
Thank you.

312
1318
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:20,566
-Miss Kim Sam Soon.
-Yes.

313
1323
00:28:22,874 --> 00:28:26,509
You responded to "Sam Soon".

314
1327
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,569
I hereby announce Kim Hee Jin's real name.

315
1331
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:35,609
Kim Sam Soon is Kim Hee Jin's real name.

316
1335
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:41,705
She's not Kim Hee Jin but her name is Kim Sam Soon.  
Sam Soon!

317
1340
00:28:41,705 --> 00:28:44,940
Manager Oh told us already.

318
1344
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,648
I thought everyone knew. 
Miss Yang Ja, maybe you're the only one who didn't know?

319
1349
00:28:47,648 --> 00:28:49,693
It's Captain Jang!

320
1353
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,006
Sorry.

321
1357
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:55,298
Captain Jang.  If you don't like your name,
you should change it, too.

322
1362
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:59,268
Young Hee, Young Soon...
Young Soon's pretty good

323
1367
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:02,191
You can name your daughter Young Soon.

324
1371
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:04,684
Stop it already, Captain Jang.

325
1375
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:13,863
I was planning to change my name,
but I'll use my real name.

326
1380
00:29:13,863 --> 00:29:17,373
Sorry I kept this from everyone.

327
1384
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:19,880
Is this okay now?

328
1388
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,177
Why would you change your name?
What's wrong with Sam Soon?

329
1393
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:24,856
Sam Soon is way better than Hee Jin.

330
1397
00:29:24,856 --> 00:29:27,380
What kind of name is Hee Jin?
It's neither this or that.

331
1402
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,021
Sam Soon is better, right everyone?

332
1406
00:29:30,021 --> 00:29:32,078
Miss Sam Soon. I like Sam Soon better.

333
1410
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:33,772
Me too!  Sam Soon noona.

334
1414
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:37,140
-Me too, Sam Soon noona.
-Me three, Sam Soon noona.

335
1419
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:43,408
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Bye

336
1424
00:29:49,425 --> 00:29:52,128
See you tomorrow, Sam Soon.

337
1428
00:30:00,235 --> 00:30:01,903
What?

338
1432
00:30:03,576 --> 00:30:05,510
Your eyes don't hurt?

339
1436
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,570
None of your business.

340
1440
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:12,982
I think you are two years my junior.

341
1444
00:30:12,982 --> 00:30:15,559
Shouldn't you be calling me, Unnie.
 Young Ja?

342
1449
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,991
You lied to me, didn't you, Young Ja?

343
1453
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:25,362
Says who?

344
1457
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:28,075
It's fine if you didn't.

345
1461
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:31,191
It'll be nice if you called me Unnie.  
Young Ja.

346
1466
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,325
What the heck.

347
1470
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:41,103
Wench.  She's so cute.
What's the difference between her name and mine?

348
1475
00:31:00,184 --> 00:31:03,879
I know this seems abrupt, but can we talk?

349
1479
00:31:17,616 --> 00:31:20,856
Coincidentally, we share the same name.

350
1483
00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:27,454
That's... Yeah, that's right.

351
1487
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:31,228
The cake was really good.

352
1491
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:40,013
Asking to see me like this ... I'm sorry.

353
1495
00:31:40,013 --> 00:31:42,009
That's okay.

354
1499
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,930
When did you guys start seeing each other?

355
1503
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,275
Not long ago.

356
1507
00:31:53,502 --> 00:31:55,817
Just passed 100 days.

357
1511
00:31:55,817 --> 00:31:58,453
Since you've been at the restaurant?

358
1515
00:31:58,453 --> 00:31:59,964
Yes.

359
1519
00:31:59,964 --> 00:32:03,861
How much do you know about Jin Hyun?

360
1523
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:05,873
Not much.

361
1527
00:32:05,873 --> 00:32:11,292
I've been to his home and he has a mom and a niece.

362
1531
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:14,732
He has a lousy temper...

363
1535
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:19,972
He was in a bad car accident few years ago,
and he must have hurt his legs a lot.

364
1540
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,705
That's why he's afraid of driving.

365
1544
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:24,169
-You've been to his house?
-Yes, to introduce myself.

366
1549
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:26,381
They approved of you dating each other?

367
1553
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:29,420
Yes, they said to first try dating.

368
1557
00:32:42,818 --> 00:32:45,120
Is Mi Joo doing okay?

369
1561
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,996
Yes.

370
1565
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:02,899
Can I ask you few questions now?

371
1569
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:03,784
Yes.

372
1573
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:05,561
How long have has it been since you last met?

373
1577
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:06,997
3 years.

374
1581
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:09,044
You were far away?

375
1585
00:33:09,044 --> 00:33:10,897
Yes, I went to California.

376
1589
00:33:10,897 --> 00:33:13,406
Why did you go there?

377
1593
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,380
Sorry about that.

378
1597
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:22,176
But, you want to start again?

379
1601
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,768
We never ended our relationship.

380
1605
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:26,974
We didn't break up.

381
1609
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:32,016
I was in an unavoidable situation, 
so we were apart for 3 years.

382
1614
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:34,800
Jin Hyun has a misunderstanding.

383
1618
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:38,240
Has Jin Hyun ever mention me?

384
1622
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,319
I guessed he must have had a girlfriend.

385
1626
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,857
But he never personally mentioned it.

386
1630
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,920
-Miss Kim Hee Jin.
-Yes.

387
1635
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,760
Do you love Jin Hyun?

388
1639
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,153
<i>If you're going to be like this, we might as well terminate the contract.</i>

389
1643
00:33:59,153 --> 00:34:00,205
<i>Then, terminate it.</i>

390
1647
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,516
<i>Fine, terminate it.</i>

391
1651
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:04,492
<i>From now on, we never signed any contract, but...</i>

392
1655
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:07,115
<i>pay back $50,000 right now.</i>

393
1659
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:08,979
Kim Hee Jin

394
1663
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,640
Yes?

395
1667
00:34:10,642 --> 00:34:13,026
Keep on speaking.

396
1671
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:17,790
So..., actually...

397
1675
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:22,700
Actually, ...  I love him.

398
1679
00:34:23,776 --> 00:34:28,319
I ... the boss.  No...
I really love Jin Hyun.

399
1684
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:30,440
So please don't come between us.

400
1688
00:34:32,073 --> 00:34:35,164
I understand how you feel.

401
1692
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:37,016
But it's over now.

402
1696
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:40,412
-It's not over.
-If it was 3 years ago, then it's been over.

403
1701
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,859
I said we didn't break up.

404
1705
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:46,352
That's just you want to believe. 
Jin Hyun said he doesn't like you anymore.

405
1710
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:48,471
He's just mad.

406
1714
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:50,720
-Yoo Hee Jin.
-Yes, Kim Hee Jin.

407
1719
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,339
You're pretty thick-skinned.

408
1723
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:58,186
You don't call for 3 years. 
And suddenly you appear and say you want him back.

409
1728
00:34:58,186 --> 00:35:00,552
What kind of situation is this?

410
1732
00:35:00,552 --> 00:35:03,594
-He was originally my man.
-Now, he is my man.

411
1737
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:07,256
-We never broke up.
-But we are dating now.

412
1742
00:35:07,256 --> 00:35:09,205
It's just been 100 days.

413
1746
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:10,549
But we've been together for more than 8 years.

414
1750
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:13,266
You must not know because you're too young.

415
1754
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:16,032
Memories are memories.

416
1758
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:19,008
There's no strength in memories.

417
1762
00:35:19,008 --> 00:35:23,505
I don't have ill feelings towards you.

418
1766
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:26,690
So just leave us alone.

419
1770
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:30,690
I don't want to.
You leave.

420
1775
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:33,821
You don't look like it but you're stubborn.

421
1779
00:35:33,821 --> 00:35:37,310
What should we do then? Split him in half?

422
1783
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,559
Don't be childish.

423
1787
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,650
Should I teach you one more thing?

424
1791
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:47,381
Love is supposed to be childish.

425
1795
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,686
I should be talking to him personally.

426
1799
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:57,159
I made a mistake.

427
1803
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:59,240
Sorry for taking up your time.

428
1807
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:01,942
I'll go now.

429
1811
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:04,381
I'll get it.

430
1815
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:06,884
No, I asked you out, so I'll get it.

431
1819
00:36:06,884 --> 00:36:08,285
No.

432
1823
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:11,413
I'm older so I got it.

433
1827
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:13,270
I'll pay for it.

434
1831
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,635
I'll pay for it.

435
1835
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:17,928
Let's split the bill.

436
1839
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:22,253
Okay, I'll get yours, and you pay for mine.

437
1843
00:36:22,253 --> 00:36:23,554
Why?

438
1847
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:25,800
This is what you call memories.

439
1851
00:37:09,533 --> 00:37:13,211
<i>You wretch! Get out of the car!</i>

440
1855
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:42,861
What was I thinking?

441
1859
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,819
What do you mean?
You put on a show.

442
1864
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:48,908
You should have just made some excuses and left.

443
1868
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:55,288
That's what I was going to to in the beginning. But what am I suppose to do when she keeps asking me questions?

444
1872
00:37:56,514 --> 00:37:58,700
-It's not a lie, right?
-About what?

445
1877
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,813
You like Sam Shik?

446
1881
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:04,714
What?

447
1885
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,394
About that...

448
1889
00:38:08,394 --> 00:38:11,735
The chances of that happening is equivalent to 
me attaining a road that I dig up.

449
1894
00:38:11,735 --> 00:38:13,235
You never know.

450
1898
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:14,938
You might win it.

451
1902
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:16,770
You think I'm LK?

452
1906
00:38:17,516 --> 00:38:20,505
You don't like him just a teeny bit?

453
1910
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:26,224
-No.
-Why did you hesitate a bit?

454
1915
00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:29,373
I don't know.  The mask is getting all dried up.

455
1919
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,388
Okay, so you don't.

456
1923
00:38:31,388 --> 00:38:34,992
But what's between them?
 I'm getting curious.

457
1928
00:38:34,992 --> 00:38:37,258
Should we ask Young Suk?

458
1932
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:38,948
Will Young Suk know?

459
1936
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:41,184
They have things in common.

460
1940
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:43,718
What field is Sam Shik's mom in?

461
1944
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:48,952
Don't know. They are in some motel business.

462
1948
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,140
What? Motel?

463
1952
00:38:52,095 --> 00:38:54,210
It doesn't suit him.

464
1956
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,574
Don't ask. I'm not interested.

465
1960
00:38:57,574 --> 00:38:59,944
Then try to be interested from now on.

466
1964
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:02,407
You never know. You might end up dating him for real.

467
1968
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,536
I said I'm not!

468
1972
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:32,490
Hello.

469
1976
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,560
<i>Are you okay?</i>

470
1980
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,950
Oh, no.  I was just trying to sleep.

471
1984
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:42,930
<i>Oh, sure. Okay, I have good news and bad news 
so which one do you want to hear first?</i>

472
1989
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,610
Just the good news, please.

473
1993
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:49,070
<i>All right. The good news is
 that I got six months off from work, finally.</i>

474
1998
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,030
Six months?

475
2002
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:55,660
<i>Yes, six months.It's like a sabbatical or something.</i>

476
2006
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:01,040
Well, congratulations. You really wanted that break.
 I'm happy for you.

477
2011
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,680
<i>The bad news is that ...</i>

478
2015
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,480
<i>I'm coming to Korea next week.</i>

479
2019
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:27,093
Not...

480
2023
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:31,771
Like him..., not.

481
2027
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:37,413
Like him..., not.

482
2031
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,247
Not.

483
2035
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:45,940
Not..., ever.

484
2039
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,576
<i>Yes, I wasn't jealous of her.
And it's not because I'm interested in crazy prince.</i>

485
2044
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:56,091
<i>I'm just envious of their love.</i>

486
2048
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:58,731
<i>I've been in love before.</i>

487
2052
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:02,653
<i>But we don't have a song.</i>

488
2056
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:06,601
<i>I don't even hate him now.</i>

489
2060
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:10,393
<i>I'm just angry with them,
flaunting their love in front of me</i>.

490
2065
00:41:24,419 --> 00:41:28,274
Are you that desperate to get married? 
 What are you doing in the moonlight?

491
2070
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:34,280
You really startled me!
What are you doing here, like a ghost?

492
2075
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,640
You're more like the ghost, an "old-maid" ghost.

493
2079
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:42,777
Anyway, what are you doing out here at night?

494
2083
00:41:42,777 --> 00:41:44,810
I couldn't sleep.

495
2087
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:59,030
-Give it to me, I'll do it.
-You don't know how to do it.

496
2092
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,799
So, why didn't you marry a man 
who would live with you for a long time.

497
2097
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:04,989
Worry about yourself.

498
2101
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,330
At least I was married once.
You're going to die before  getting married even once.

499
2106
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,400
-You're stepping on my chili plants.
-Stop!  You startled me!

500
2111
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:14,234
Why are there so many chilies?

501
2115
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:17,149
It's everywhere.
Are you selling them or what?

502
2120
00:42:17,149 --> 00:42:20,831
Why would I do that?
I'll eat them all

503
2125
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:22,761
So sneaky!

504
2129
00:42:23,862 --> 00:42:25,822
You're the sneaky one.

505
2133
00:42:25,822 --> 00:42:29,182
Do you know how good chilies taste in middle of the summer?

506
2137
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:02,492
There ... we're done tying it up.

507
2141
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:07,715
It's so pretty.

508
2145
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:11,784
Now let's check Mi Joo's nails.

509
2149
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:13,565
It looks good.

510
2153
00:43:13,565 --> 00:43:17,615
Today, we'll make checkered cookies,

511
2157
00:43:17,615 --> 00:43:22,000
and butterfly and rabbit shaped cookes.

512
2161
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,691
It's me.

513
2165
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:33,830
Did you find out about the girl that was here?

514
2169
00:43:34,484 --> 00:43:37,490
This is the guest list and seating plan
for Jang Chae Ri's engagement party.

515
2174
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,004
Please be careful with the seating arrangement.

516
2178
00:43:40,004 --> 00:43:42,715
There are quite a few people who aren't on good terms.

517
2182
00:43:42,715 --> 00:43:44,220
I understand.

518
2186
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:46,670
But,

519
2190
00:43:47,674 --> 00:43:52,660
The young lady who was here the other day.
She's the lady from a while ago, right?

520
2195
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:55,904
How do you know that?

521
2199
00:43:55,904 --> 00:43:59,120
You don't know? 
She came to see me several times.

522
2204
00:43:59,976 --> 00:44:05,893
For the first few days, she went on her knees, 
begging me to forgive her.

523
2209
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:10,073
Next few days, when I was sick and couldn't eat anything,

524
2213
00:44:10,073 --> 00:44:12,907
she came over, cooked porridge for me, and clean my house.

525
2217
00:44:12,907 --> 00:44:16,164
She sat next to me and cried.

526
2221
00:44:16,164 --> 00:44:20,030
I'm getting muddle-headed.
Don't worry about it. Get back to work.

527
2226
00:44:27,988 --> 00:44:33,861
Wrap this with cellophane and
put it in the fridge for 10 minutes.

528
2231
00:44:33,861 --> 00:44:37,163
This is tissue paper, tissue.

529
2235
00:44:37,163 --> 00:44:41,191
But it's not the one used in the washroom.

530
2239
00:44:41,191 --> 00:44:44,949
We're letting the breathe for a while.

531
2243
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:50,094
That way, the cookies will be crispy and taste better.

532
2247
00:44:51,813 --> 00:44:56,046
What shall we do for the next 10 minutes?  Huh?

533
2251
00:44:56,046 --> 00:44:57,800
Mi Joo.

534
2255
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:04,272
Is it fun baking cookies?

535
2259
00:45:04,272 --> 00:45:06,882
I'm curious to see the cookies Mi Joo will make.

536
2263
00:45:06,882 --> 00:45:10,016
-If you're curious, you can bake with us.
-What?

537
2268
00:45:10,016 --> 00:45:13,757
Mi Joo, shall we make cookies with uncle?

538
2272
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:36,574
Put it down straight, it's all out of place.

539
2276
00:45:36,574 --> 00:45:38,735
What's that? It's all out of line.

540
2280
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:42,292
Straight, in a neat way.

541
2284
00:45:43,987 --> 00:45:46,838
Come over and do this.

542
2288
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:48,588
Go over.

543
2292
00:45:58,478 --> 00:46:01,350
Mi Joo, let me have a look.

544
2296
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:08,227
Mi Joo. You have curly hair,  just like Momo.

545
2300
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:10,992
Do you know who's Momo?

546
2304
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:14,888
Momo is as tall as you are.

547
2308
00:46:14,888 --> 00:46:19,590
Momo has no house, and no mom and dad either.

548
2312
00:46:21,272 --> 00:46:24,212
Where's your mom and dad?

549
2316
00:46:26,379 --> 00:46:28,680
Kim Sam Soon.

550
2320
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:32,234
I understand.

551
2324
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:34,726
Let's start over.

552
2328
00:46:34,726 --> 00:46:40,328
Momo has no house, no grandmother or uncle.

553
2332
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:42,486
Momo is a pitiful child.

554
2336
00:46:42,486 --> 00:46:46,755
But everyone loves Momo.

555
2340
00:46:46,755 --> 00:46:51,404
Because Momo is a good listener.

556
2344
00:46:51,404 --> 00:46:56,474
Not like this ... gently.

557
2348
00:46:56,474 --> 00:46:59,547
Momo doesn't talk.

558
2352
00:46:59,547 --> 00:47:01,794
Not because she doesn't know how to,

559
2356
00:47:01,794 --> 00:47:04,548
but because she really likes to listen to other people.

560
2360
00:47:04,548 --> 00:47:07,639
If anyone in her town has a problem,

561
2364
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:11,297
she'll listen to them, all ears.

562
2368
00:47:11,297 --> 00:47:13,923
It's important to know how to be a good listener.

563
2372
00:47:13,923 --> 00:47:18,093
Then the town people,
 no matter how difficult their problem is,

564
2377
00:47:18,093 --> 00:47:21,375
they go away feeling happier 
as if the problem has been solved.

565
2382
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:25,062
I wanted to be a person like that.  But,

566
2386
00:47:25,062 --> 00:47:30,098
I ended up becoming an adult, who only talks about herself.

567
2390
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:32,716
You are like Momo sometimes

568
2394
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:33,630
Really?

569
2398
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,760
Momo must have been a brat.

570
2402
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,866
What'd you say?

571
2406
00:47:40,593 --> 00:47:42,348
This ahjumma, really ...

572
2410
00:47:42,348 --> 00:47:44,780
Jerk, calling me Ahjumma.

573
2414
00:47:52,054 --> 00:47:55,092
You really look like Sam Shik now.

574
2418
00:48:03,415 --> 00:48:05,729
Isn't that our boss's laughter?

575
2422
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:08,922
It sounds like Supervisor Lee's voice.

576
2426
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:15,170
Can't you differentiate between the sounds of 
a melting butter and a jade marble sliding down a silver plate?

577
2431
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,409
-This is the first time I've heard the boss laugh..
-Me too.

578
2436
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:22,081
Sometimes, he's like this when he's with his niece.

579
2440
00:48:25,231 --> 00:48:27,191
That old maid!

580
2444
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:45,926
You know how to laugh?

581
2448
00:48:45,926 --> 00:48:48,790
This is the first time I'm seeing you laugh like that.

582
2452
00:48:51,226 --> 00:48:56,464
If you laugh like that, will they come to audit you?

583
2456
00:48:56,464 --> 00:48:59,176
I am an honest person.

584
2460
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:11,439
Mi Joo made these?

585
2464
00:49:11,439 --> 00:49:17,052
Goodness, our Mi Joo knows how to make cookies well.

586
2468
00:49:17,052 --> 00:49:18,779
Did you find out?

587
2472
00:49:18,779 --> 00:49:20,897
It's Hee Jin.

588
2476
00:49:20,897 --> 00:49:25,025
Hee Jin? She's back?

589
2480
00:49:25,025 --> 00:49:26,934
-Yes.
-Then what happened?

590
2485
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:31,430
I'm not sure.
We don't know what happened after they left together.

591
2490
00:49:32,305 --> 00:49:37,040
I told her so many times.
If she came back, she should've called me first.

592
2495
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:41,589
-Does Jin Hyun know about that incident?
-No.

593
2500
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:44,012
Hyun Suk, go find out Hee Jin's number.

594
2504
00:49:44,012 --> 00:49:46,369
-You want to see her?
-Of course.

595
2509
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:48,905
I need to see her make sure she doesn't say anything.

596
2513
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,616
Hello.

597
2517
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:10,647
I'd like to rent a cellphone from you.

608
2565
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:08,580
Sorry.  Waiting outside was tiring.

609
2569
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,473
How did you get in?

610
2573
00:52:11,473 --> 00:52:14,798
Our cellphone pin numbers were the same.

611
2577
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,834
I took a chance and I tried those numbers.

612
2581
00:52:25,046 --> 00:52:27,537
Why didn't you change it?

613
2585
00:52:29,891 --> 00:52:32,203
Troublesome.

614
2589
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:37,562
Is it only because of that?

615
2593
00:52:40,919 --> 00:52:44,384
Yes. Should there be anything else?

616
2597
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,753
I saw Kim Hee Jin a few days ago.

617
2601
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:57,796
Your mom approved?

618
2605
00:53:00,874 --> 00:53:02,803
Do you love her?

619
2609
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,985
Will you marry her?

620
2613
00:53:14,594 --> 00:53:17,125
It has nothing to do with you.

621
2617
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:29,440
What are you doing?

622
2621
00:53:30,384 --> 00:53:35,344
I didn't look at you properly the other day.

623
2625
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:44,250
What did you want to say that day?

624
2629
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,130
You said you had something to tell me.
About why you left me?

625
2634
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:51,200
Did you have someone else?

626
2638
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,800
Is that it?

627
2642
00:53:54,677 --> 00:53:57,450
You are just like the rest.

628
2646
00:54:23,979 --> 00:54:27,380
That's right! I'm just like anyone else.

629
2650
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:32,030
A week after the accident,
you left without a word for studies that wren't even planned!

630
2655
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,889
What kind of guy wouldn't think that.

631
2659
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:37,810
I searched every colleges in US.

632
2663
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,811
None had your name on the register.

633
2667
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:46,450
I thought of you a hundred times,
a thousand times everyday.

634
2672
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:51,030
Whether you left because you didn't want to 
see a crippled man or if you had someone else?

635
2677
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:54,484
In order to stop thinking of you,

636
2681
00:54:54,484 --> 00:54:58,278
I took sleeping pills and slept for a week.

637
2685
00:54:58,278 --> 00:55:02,362
I hated you even in my dreams, 
and I came this far with that strength.

638
2690
00:55:02,362 --> 00:55:05,953
So tell me. What was  your reason?

639
2694
00:55:08,507 --> 00:55:13,272
I know, I know how difficult it was for you.

640
2698
00:55:13,272 --> 00:55:16,116
I know it too.

641
2702
00:55:17,238 --> 00:55:20,288
Don't put on a act, it disgusts me.

642
2706
00:56:02,335 --> 00:56:04,634
Get off.

643
2710
00:56:04,634 --> 00:56:07,053
Hurry up and get off.

644
2714
00:56:08,195 --> 00:56:11,938
Will you get off, will you break up with that woman?

645
2718
00:56:11,938 --> 00:56:13,304
-Get off.
-Are you going to break up?
-Get OFF!

646
2724
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:14,640
-Get off!
-Say it first.

647
2729
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,181
You get off first.
