00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:08,376
<i>Episode 9  
  Are my honest feelings for you a joke?</i>

2
8
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:13,766
Don't see Jin Hyun again

3
12
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:19,569
But I've recovered.

4
16
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:22,660
I have no more feelings for you.

5
20
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,826
Dad.

6
24
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:39,500
I actually fell for a guy again.

7
28
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,740
I am, I am terribly disgusted with myself. 
So much to the point of death.

8
33
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:51,490
My heart...

9
37
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:56,323
If only it was harder, Dad.

10
41
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,548
Sam Soon.

11
45
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:04,854
Dad died from heart attack because my heart was hard.

12
49
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:08,541
Your heart must race and should beat hard.

13
53
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:12,805
You must feel pain because of him.

14
57
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:18,140
I'm happy that my third daughter
has a normal heart.

15
62
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:27,895
Do you like that guy that much?

16
66
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:33,290
Yeah. I like him.

17
70
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:38,682
I like him like crazy.

18
74
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,019
Even though he's a player?

19
78
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:46,809
Dad... I didn't mean that.
 I was just saying it to have something to say.

20
83
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:51,006
Have you told him yet?
That you like him like crazy?

21
88
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:52,017
No.

22
92
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,806
Pathetic girl.

23
96
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:57,280
Then what are you crying over?

24
100
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:00,411
Should I tell him?

25
104
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:04,296
Of course, do you want to regret not telling him?

26
108
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:08,332
What if he doesn't like me?
That would be humiliating.

27
113
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:10,091
What's there to be embarrassed about?

28
117
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:11,942
What's in life?

29
121
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:14,545
If he rejects you, then you'll say
"Fine, carry on with your life"

30
126
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:17,252
and give him a good beating.

31
130
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:25,350
I just did that. I hit him real hard.

32
134
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:31,455
But he's still the same,
doing things that provoke me.

33
139
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:34,544
He's truly my punching bag!

34
143
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:37,815
What are you laughing at?

35
147
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:41,795
Your eyes are swollen from crying. Weren't you crying?

36
151
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:44,665
Sis.

37
155
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,753
Dad was here.

38
159
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:50,467
Dad didn't age one bit.

39
163
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:54,145
It's us who have aged.

40
167
00:02:57,813 --> 00:03:00,341
What do I do with you, my dear sister.

41
171
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:03,632
Just tell him that
the game's over.

42
176
00:03:03,632 --> 00:03:08,449
If I were a guy, I would pick Yoo Hee Jin too, not Kim Hee Jin.

43
180
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,235
What's so good about Yoo Hee Jin?

44
184
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:15,357
Even I am envious of her. She's desirable.

45
188
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:18,073
Why don't you adopt  her as your sister too?

46
192
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,280
And call her Sa (4)  Soon.

47
196
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,297
"Hee Jin" suits her better than Sa Soon

48
200
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:25,928
while "Sam (3) Soon" suits you.

49
204
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:31,100
What's this anyway? No one is born Sam Soon.

50
208
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,731
-Sis, what should I do?
-What is it?

51
213
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:39,880
I need to pee.

52
217
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,076
Just hold it for a while.

53
221
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:47,455
-What a relief
-That's good

54
226
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:49,919
Keep a close watch.

55
230
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:58,507
Who is it? The timing is really bad.

56
234
00:03:58,507 --> 00:04:00,296
Hurry up and answer it.

57
238
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:04,199
You want the entire neighborhood
to know you're taking a leak here?

58
243
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,131
Hello.

59
247
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:18,306
There's a place to go tomorrow.
We'll pick you up near your place.

60
252
00:04:18,306 --> 00:04:20,352
What?

61
256
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:24,385
I'll sent a car over so
wait by the front door.

62
261
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:27,408
I'll let you know the time
tomorrow morning.

63
266
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:34,813
There's someone coming,
so hurry up.

64
271
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:38,756
You approved of Sam Soon?

65
275
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:41,425
-That's impossible
-Then why...

66
280
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:44,495
I don't care if it's Sam Soon or anyone,
so long as she can get rid of Hee Jin.

67
285
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:47,432
The next step is to get rid Sam Soon.
Where's Mi Joo?

68
290
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:49,459
Asleep.

69
294
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:52,772
She's so little and doesn't
know what's going on.

70
299
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:55,767
It breaks my heart
every time she cries.

71
304
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,239
You too, Hyun Sook.
Don't fall ill.

72
309
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,002
I will throw out whomever is sick.

73
313
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:08,018
Then you should have taken me in from the start.
You're stuck with me to the end.

74
318
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:14,360
Goodness, there's so much stuff in there.
Don't you ever clean out your ear wax?

75
323
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,501
No one's doing it for me.

76
327
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:21,186
And you lived with it?
 The way things are, how could you hear?

77
332
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:24,866
Don't worry, I hear fine
just like Momo.

78
337
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,067
Momo? What's that?

79
341
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,664
A little brat.

80
345
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:32,921
She's got good hearing, 
and what else now...

81
350
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,421
Turn over.

82
354
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:41,737
There's a mole here?

83
358
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:43,210
It's always been there.

84
362
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,053
No, you never had it.

85
366
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,003
I was born with it.

86
370
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:51,857
Really? But why didn't
I know this before?

87
375
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:56,891
That shows how much you care about me.
You don't even know your guy has a mole?

88
380
00:05:56,891 --> 00:06:01,113
That's strange,
it wasn't there before.

89
385
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:06,171
Can I stay here and
go to work from here?

90
390
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,777
I'll be busy when I return to school. 
I can't cook for you.

91
395
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:11,179
We can eat at a restaurant.

92
399
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:16,044
No, I have to study.  
You'll distract me every night.

93
404
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:18,204
You're the one who's
always distracting me.

94
409
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:20,191
Brat, are you trying to start something?

95
413
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:22,776
You started it first, remember?

96
417
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:25,557
Okay okay,
now don't move.

97
422
00:06:29,078 --> 00:06:31,706
I saw your mom today.

98
426
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,181
She said she doesn't want
a sickly daughter-in-law.

99
431
00:06:41,315 --> 00:06:45,466
And Mi Joo's grown so much.

100
435
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:47,850
She's becoming so pretty.

101
439
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,382
Did you tell her you were sick?

102
443
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:01,794
Don't mind President Na's words.

103
447
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:05,837
She's just angry with
you for leaving me.

104
452
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:10,511
I know, I'll work on it.

105
456
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:12,949
But I can't go with you tomorrow.

106
460
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,897
Your mom might not
want to see me there uninvited.

107
465
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:01,079
Hello.

108
469
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:06,277
Get in the car.

109
473
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:15,598
That...

110
477
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,235
Didn't Jin Hyun tell you?

111
481
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:22,264
About what?

112
485
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:27,202
-We broke up...
-Forget about Hee Jin

113
490
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,055
Why the surprised look?
I brought her here.

114
495
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:28,640
<i>Memorial Service for Hyun Jin Tae (his brother) 
and Kim Shin Young (his sister-in-law</i>

115
500
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:12,566
I regret this sometimes.

116
504
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,701
I shouldn't have made
him join the hotel.

117
509
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:19,397
If he lived the life he wanted to live,
he might still be alive.

118
514
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:28,386
I regret buying him that motorcycle.

119
518
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:33,623
I should've warned him
to be more careful.

120
523
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:39,910
I'm going over
to thank the monks.

121
528
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,314
Are you tired?
I made you come here so early.

122
533
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:53,482
May I ask...
why is Manager here?

123
538
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:56,314
President Hyun didn't tell you?

124
542
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,273
No.

125
546
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,932
I...

126
550
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,920
I had a son.

127
554
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:47,818
I gave President Hyun
a good thrashing.

128
559
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:52,138
He was bedridden at that time.

129
563
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:56,353
I blamed him for killing my son.

130
567
00:12:56,353 --> 00:12:59,949
I scolded him and did
hateful things to him.

131
572
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:06,411
Six months after the funeral.

132
576
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,608
I started waking up to the facts.

133
580
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:14,322
I began to understand.

134
584
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:18,417
President Hyun suffered
serious injuries as well.

135
589
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:21,889
He lost both his brother
and sister-in-law.

136
594
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:25,982
My son was at fault,
following the car too closely.

137
599
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:35,039
I went to the hospital to see him before
his surgery. He didn't say a word.

138
604
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,408
He just sat there silently in tears,
looking at me.

139
609
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:45,713
A year later.

140
613
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:53,443
He said he was setting up a restaurant
and wanted me to be the manager.

141
618
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:58,960
I told him that I don't know
anything besides teaching kids.

142
623
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,950
He made several attempts to recruit me.

143
627
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:08,788
But he said teaching kids and
serving customers are the same.

144
632
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,973
I lost my only son
and was retired.

145
637
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:21,165
I knew he was worried about me.
That's why he wanted to hire me.

146
642
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,122
I'll give you a lift, Manager Oh.
It's their day off, so let them date.

147
647
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:02,466
Are you alright?

148
651
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:05,537
-I'm fine
-I'll help you get up.

149
656
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:10,073
This is so funny.

150
660
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,431
-Let's go.
-Yes.

151
665
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,576
What are you doing?

152
669
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:30,994
Don't do this again.
I've broken it off with Sam Soon.

153
674
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:31,984
Think you can have it your way?

154
678
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:33,844
What's gotten into you?

155
682
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:36,202
I should be asking you that.

156
686
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,687
You said she was somebody to you.
And how long has it been?

157
691
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:42,751
Now what?
Broken up already?

158
696
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:44,701
There's a reason.

159
700
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:49,168
If it's because of Hee Jin,
I suggest you end it with her.

160
705
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:50,569
President Na.

161
709
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:53,996
-I don't like sickly daughter-in-laws
-President Na!

162
714
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,573
This child never listens...

163
718
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:59,780
Don't scream at me like that!

164
722
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:01,223
Bad mannered.

165
726
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:29,779
When did President Na call you?

166
730
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,099
-Last night
-Why didn't you tell me?

167
735
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,138
How do I tell you when I didn't
even know what she's planning.

168
740
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:42,700
She just told me to wait
by the front and hung up.

169
745
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,604
In the future, don't listen to President Na,
just listen to me.

170
750
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,002
And...

171
754
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:52,017
I doubt something like this will happen again, but if the same thing happens again, please let me know.

172
758
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:53,558
I don't want to.

173
762
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:56,448
Because of Yoo Hye Jin, you and your mother 
are fighting a cold war.

174
767
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:00,455
I don't want to be a part
of it, nor be used like that.

175
772
00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:02,274
Whether it's President Na
or President Hyun

176
777
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:04,884
I won't heed either of you.

177
781
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:06,642
One more thing ...

178
785
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:10,117
Here.

179
789
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:18,248
<i>[ Letter of Resignation ]</i>

180
793
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:36,660
He's really leaving?

181
797
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,948
That jerk, childish prince.

182
801
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:19,524
If you've taken a lift from me,
you would've gotten home already.

183
806
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:22,577
Your legs wouldn't hurt, and
you'd be having cold ramen.

184
811
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:25,307
There you go again.

185
815
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:30,122
What's this?

186
819
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:32,261
This is not for the
woman Kim Sam Soon.

187
824
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:35,601
It's for patisserie Kim Sam Soon.

188
828
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:41,583
I didn't want to say this.

189
832
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,506
You are an outstanding patisserie.

190
836
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:47,816
I don't want to lose you.

191
840
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:52,872
Take it, my arm hurts.

192
844
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,372
You have to get
on your knees first

193
849
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:59,327
Never seen it in movies?

194
853
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:02,427
No one gives flowers to a girl that way,
standing there like a blockhead

195
858
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:05,257
-I'm not giving them to a girl
-I don't care

196
863
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:09,001
You either get on your knees
or hire another patisserie

197
868
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:15,366
Miss Kim Sam Soon

198
872
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:18,180
Hey Sam Soon!

199
876
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,229
You're really...

200
880
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,286
Why are you following me?

201
884
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:33,039
Why? Are you really
getting down on your knees?

202
889
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,309
If I do, you'll take it back?

203
893
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,976
-I'll think about it
-How can you be like this?

204
898
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:41,257
Why not? I'm like that

205
902
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:43,097
Persuade me.

206
906
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:47,753
If you can do that,
I might change my mind

207
911
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,600
Forget it then

208
915
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:14,067
Where did your temper go?

209
919
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:17,220
Hurry up and take it, my knees hurt.

210
923
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:31,830
-That okay?
-No

211
928
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:35,675
I haven't changed my mind yet

212
932
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:40,002
Since I accepted your flowers,
I'll take them with me.

213
937
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:44,882
No one does that!

214
941
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:47,274
I do. What are you going to do about it?

215
945
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:51,064
Then return the flowers.

216
949
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:54,311
I don't think you know about flowers.

217
953
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:57,100
You should at least give me
some time to find a new patisserie.

218
958
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,579
Why aren't you using formal speech?

219
962
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:02,316
Can a Pro do this?

220
966
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:04,852
Are you an amateur? Did you go to work as a hobby?

221
970
00:21:04,852 --> 00:21:07,619
Hey! Still using informal speech?

222
974
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,565
Remember what you said
during the interview?

223
979
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:13,177
What? The box of chocolate
contains the life of a person?

224
984
00:21:13,177 --> 00:21:16,541
Look at you. You obviously
didn't mean what you said

225
989
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:19,369
What's it going to be?

226
993
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:25,221
Either you take responsibility
or admit you were lying.

227
998
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:27,953
-What did you say to me?
-What?

228
1003
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,031
Still using informal speech?

229
1007
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:32,800
I'll give you two weeks.

230
1011
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:39,506
I'll teach In Hye as much I can 
while you find another patisserie.

231
1016
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,373
No more negotiation.

232
1020
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:54,278
Hello, is Mother in there?

233
1024
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:58,253
-She is, but...
-I'll go talk to her

234
1029
00:21:58,253 --> 00:22:01,892
It's just that.... Hee Jin...
Hee Jin!

235
1034
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:05,565
Yes, it's settled then

236
1038
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:08,263
We'll meet up next week.

237
1042
00:22:08,263 --> 00:22:11,288
Yes, please arrange a date
with Secretary Yoon.

238
1047
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,577
I'm hanging up then.

239
1051
00:22:15,128 --> 00:22:17,193
Let's go work out together, Mother.

240
1055
00:22:17,193 --> 00:22:20,657
I took up yoga recently,
I'd like you to go with me.

241
1060
00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:23,474
Are you going against me?

242
1064
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:27,735
-We can go to lunch together after yoga
-Can you get out now?

243
1069
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:32,040
What were you doing?
Why did you let her in?

244
1074
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,439
Don't be like this,
It's just an hour..

245
1079
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,876
Please give me an hour.

246
1083
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:39,615
You can watch me practice.
It'll be fun.

247
1088
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:42,866
Get her out of here now!

248
1092
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:44,603
Mother.

249
1096
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:47,923
I'm healthy now, not sick any more.

250
1100
00:22:47,923 --> 00:22:49,921
Hee Jin.

251
1104
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,848
Secretary Yoon.

252
1108
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:09,545
I made a fool of myself today.
Will you buy me lunch?

253
1113
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:22,906
Don't you have to
watch what you eat?

254
1118
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:25,125
So long as I'm eating happily.

255
1122
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,916
-Says who?
-Henry

256
1127
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,765
He's my doctor.

257
1131
00:23:30,765 --> 00:23:32,843
I thought you would've
been married by now.

258
1136
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:35,488
Didn't you have a
boyfriend back then?

259
1141
00:23:36,522 --> 00:23:38,693
Do I?

260
1145
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:43,906
When you stay at a place too long,
it's not easy to move and change.

261
1150
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:46,747
It's a bother.
Don't want to.

262
1155
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:55,833
You have to tell Mother 
that I'm eating well.

263
1160
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,311
You should start training hard today.

264
1164
00:24:02,311 --> 00:24:04,867
You'll do all the dough part from now on, all right?

265
1168
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:07,831
-Why?
-Why? You don't wanna learn?

266
1173
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:11,877
-No! Why wouldn't I?
-Great, then let's start.

267
1178
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:44,088
Watch me.

268
1182
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:50,197
Like this...
Get it?

269
1187
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:03,311
Right, this is the temperature.28 to 29 degrees, lower 1 or 2 degrees for milk chocolate  and white chocolate.

270
1191
00:25:03,311 --> 00:25:04,909
Can I use a thermometer?

271
1195
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:07,139
Think of your hand
as the thermometer.

272
1200
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,900
No, think of your body as
a thermometer the way the pro's do it.

273
1205
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,000
Yes

274
1209
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:24,015
Long time no see.

275
1213
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:27,000
Can you excuse us for a while?

276
1217
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:31,217
I heard about it.

277
1221
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:34,815
About what? Don't you
have better things to do?

278
1226
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:37,801
You were dumped by Jin Hyun.

279
1230
00:25:39,508 --> 00:25:41,556
Hee Jin and him got back together?

280
1234
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:44,672
-I feel sorry for you
-Bad news spreads fast.

281
1239
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:46,196
It happens.

282
1243
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:48,072
Sister, don't be too upset.

283
1247
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:49,671
He's not meant for you anyway.

284
1251
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:52,959
Thank you for your concern.
If there's nothing else, please go.

285
1256
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:55,644
Do you want me to
introduce you a guy?

286
1261
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:59,211
--Are you being charitable?
-Yeah, my mister...

287
1266
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:03,185
I don't want you 
 flirting with my Hyun Woo.

288
1271
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:06,734
I heard you were clinging onto
him while you were in Paris, like a spider...

289
1276
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,628
That bastard told you that?

290
1280
00:26:08,628 --> 00:26:10,961
How can you say that about him?

291
1284
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:13,837
You are good at speaking ill of others.
Why don't you run an ad in the newpaper about that?

292
1289
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:17,300
I did that already, don't worry.
Now go away.

293
1294
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,448
I'm warning you not to
flirt with my Hyun Woo.

294
1299
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,706
Why won't you answer me?

295
1303
00:26:24,706 --> 00:26:26,858
Kim Sam Soon!

296
1307
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:34,169
Do you think you're so great? Oppa Hyun Woo was confused for a while, and you caught the eye of Oppa Jin Hun.

297
1311
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:35,816
Don't be mistaken.

298
1315
00:26:35,816 --> 00:26:40,434
You're just a dish they had a craving for. Do you get it?

299
1319
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:43,154
Are you finished talking?

300
1323
00:26:43,154 --> 00:26:47,474
Promise me you won't
make a pass at my Hyun Woo

301
1328
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:48,811
Leave before things turn nasty.

302
1332
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:51,944
-Promise me first!
-Hurry up and leave.

303
1337
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,715
-Leave before I hit you!
-You won't promise me?

304
1342
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:57,093
You're really...

305
1346
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:04,719
What's this for, sister!

306
1350
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,357
Why are you venting
your anger out on me?

307
1355
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:23,039
Jang Chae Ri, come back here!

308
1359
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:29,004
Who does she take me for?
Sprouting nonsense like that.

309
1364
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:34,416
If she dares to mess with me once more,
I'll bake her to a crisp in the oven.

310
1369
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:38,757
What are you looking at?
Do you want to be put in the  oven too?

311
1374
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:43,802
Come again, I'll stuff her
in a bag of flour.

312
1379
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,949
Whoever provokes me,

313
1383
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:52,335
I'll mix him with eggs and flour,
then fry him and eat him.

314
1388
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:07,083
If I can pass my constipation on 
to Sam Shik, that'll be great.

315
1393
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,621
Pass it on...

316
1397
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:15,659
And pass the piles
to him as well.

317
1402
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:33,016
Who is it?

318
1406
00:28:34,515 --> 00:28:36,528
Who is it?

319
1410
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:42,011
Is it Supervisor Lee?

320
1414
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:45,050
Or is it Gi Bang?

321
1418
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,535
i'm sorry, but I decline hemorrhoids.

322
1422
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:54,702
Why didn't you say anything?
Why are you hiding there?

323
1427
00:28:54,702 --> 00:28:58,306
Who's hiding? You were
the one talking non-stop,

324
1432
00:29:01,913 --> 00:29:06,880
Say there! Can I ask a favor?

325
1436
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,829
What kind of favors do you want
in the bathroom?

326
1441
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:14,680
Do you have any toilet paper to spare?

327
1445
00:29:24,812 --> 00:29:29,424
Oh dear, there's none in here,

328
1449
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:33,011
Who's in charge
of the cleaning?

329
1454
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:43,436
Under such circumstances, people with different blood types react differently. You want to know more?

330
1458
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:49,830
Blood type A: patient and introvert.
They'll wait for the cleaning lady.

331
1463
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:56,629
Blood type B: confident.
They'll solve it with 2 things.

332
1468
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:59,174
The 2 things are...

333
1472
00:30:01,095 --> 00:30:03,546
fingers!

334
1476
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:11,257
AB blood types have traits of
blood types A and B in them.

335
1481
00:30:11,257 --> 00:30:17,068
They'll re-use the toilet paper
in the trash bin.

336
1486
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:21,135
The easy-going blood type O
will just walk out.

337
1491
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:24,590
Why? Cause they can
clean up after themselves later.

338
1496
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,845
What's you blood type, President?

339
1500
00:30:29,842 --> 00:30:32,173
What would you do?

340
1504
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:36,081
Having lived 30 years,
this is a piece of cake.

341
1509
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:38,704
My answer is...

342
1513
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,904
socks.

343
1517
00:30:53,108 --> 00:30:55,026
What are you doing?

344
1521
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:56,668
Cleaning my socks.

345
1525
00:30:56,668 --> 00:31:00,954
I used one. There's another
one left. You want it?

346
1530
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,415
Will you get me some toilet paper?

347
1534
00:31:07,415 --> 00:31:11,988
Sure, but it'll take
a while, okay?

348
1539
00:31:11,988 --> 00:31:14,579
Can you hurry up?

349
1543
00:31:17,623 --> 00:31:21,632
It kind of stinks. Are you
having a tummy upset?

350
1548
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:22,981
It's not me.

351
1552
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,105
Then it's me?

352
1556
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:38,845
This is strange. Has
anyone seen the President?

353
1561
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:40,851
No.

354
1565
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:43,142
Maybe he went out?

355
1569
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:47,387
But he would have
said something to me.

356
1574
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:49,772
Sam Soon, do you know?
Did he say anything to you?

357
1579
00:31:49,772 --> 00:31:52,475
Why ask Sam Soon?

358
1583
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:55,528
He's probably with
his new girlfriend.

359
1588
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,354
New girlfriend?
What's that about?

360
1593
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:05,962
Oh yes, the jeans.

361
1597
00:32:05,962 --> 00:32:11,009
I'm sorry, Chef Lee.
My sister wants me to give it to you, but I keep forgetting,

362
1602
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:14,320
-I'll remember to bring it
-The jeans are not important.

363
1607
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,487
About that new girlfriend,
you guys broke up?

364
1612
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:21,455
Why'd you poke me?

365
1616
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:25,064
If you have something
to say, then say it.

366
1621
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:26,740
About that...

367
1625
00:32:34,322 --> 00:32:36,166
Have a seat.

368
1629
00:32:41,954 --> 00:32:44,539
About that...

369
1633
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:47,729
I know.
Go ahead and eat

370
1638
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:56,041
Vegetables are good for constipation.

371
1642
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,955
They are good for your piles too.

372
1646
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:12,183
I know a doctor who's good
with piles. Shall I introduce you?

373
1651
00:33:12,183 --> 00:33:17,385
Hey. I'm going dancing tonight.
Who wants to come?

374
1656
00:33:17,385 --> 00:33:20,311
I'll go...

375
1660
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:35,336
Sister Sam Soon,

376
1664
00:34:35,336 --> 00:34:38,453
I'm disappointed with President.

377
1668
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,651
Me, too.

378
1672
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:42,472
What's up with you guys today?

379
1676
00:34:42,472 --> 00:34:44,435
He'd just broken off with you
a few days, and...

380
1681
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:47,368
He pretends to have no interest
in women, but he's a player.

381
1686
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:49,849
That's what I say! He's a hypocrite.

382
1690
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:52,861
Are you guys saying this,
so I'll buy you drinks?

383
1695
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:54,344
No.

384
1699
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:56,171
Sister, don't be upset?

385
1703
00:34:56,171 --> 00:35:00,877
You'll find someone better than
President. You show him that!

386
1708
00:35:00,877 --> 00:35:03,207
That's right,
we are behind you.

387
1713
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:08,408
Even though sister is slightly
plump... but your skin is good.

388
1718
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:13,911
Now you're seeing
what's good about me.

389
1723
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,014
Being dumped is not a bad idea.

390
1727
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:20,204
But is there anyone
better than President?

391
1732
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,144
That's true. He's cute and
has so many girls after him.

392
1737
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:32,227
His body is a work of art,
and he's suave.

393
1742
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:35,747
Whenever I look into
his eyes, I'll...

394
1747
00:35:36,807 --> 00:35:41,870
How can you say this in front of
someone who just got dumped?

395
1752
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:48,583
But you guys are all wrong.
It's his lips that's most appealing.

396
1757
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,719
A bunch of kids.

397
1761
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,335
How does it feel if you
can't eat what you want?

398
1766
00:35:56,335 --> 00:36:00,700
Bitter, totally bitter.

399
1770
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,572
Of course it'll feel bitter.

400
1774
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:07,101
You are out of his league.

401
1778
00:36:07,101 --> 00:36:09,084
Hey, Jang Yong Ja.

402
1782
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,119
What, Kim Sam Soon?

403
1786
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,975
You pay for your own drinks?

404
1790
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:17,181
Ladies!

405
1794
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:20,790
What are pretty ladies
doing here?

406
1799
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:25,160
There's a group of cute guys
over there, dying to meet you all.

407
1804
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,644
Are they really cute?

408
1808
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:33,505
<i>Sam Shik Yi</i>
 Of course! Come on, let's go

409
1813
00:36:35,274 --> 00:36:40,198
You two can stay here.
Give the younger ones a chance.

410
1818
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,467
-We're off
-Let's go.

411
1823
00:36:44,612 --> 00:36:48,911
What guys would
like girls like that?

412
1828
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:51,191
Ingrates.

413
1832
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:55,095
Guys named Sam Shik
are all the same.

414
1837
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:03,817
Drink that one.

415
1841
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:17,290
Grand ... grandfather. Grandfather. Grandfather.

416
1845
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:23,800
Grandmother. Mother. Mother. Grandmother.

417
1849
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:14,911
No one wants to stalk an old maid.

418
1853
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:39,644
The next song is,
"Over the Rainbow".

419
1858
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:43,137
We met old friends here today.

420
1862
00:39:43,137 --> 00:39:45,503
There's a line that goes like this.

421
1866
00:39:45,503 --> 00:39:51,522
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then why, can't I?

422
1871
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:56,779
Birds fly over the rainbow.

423
1875
00:39:56,779 --> 00:39:59,659
Then why can't I fly?

424
1879
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:02,588
At this point, someone says

425
1883
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:06,037
"Cause you're fat, that's
why you can't fly"

426
1888
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:30,566
How did he get out
from the bathroom?

427
1893
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:34,091
Type A... Type B?

428
1897
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:37,717
He can't be a Type O.

429
1901
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:43,308
That jerk looks like a Type B.

430
1905
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,420
That means he used this...?

431
1909
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:55,073
The curiosity is killing me.
Which one did he pick?

432
1914
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:25,143
I'm not asking a lot.

433
1918
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:29,108
I just want someone like you.

434
1922
00:41:30,774 --> 00:41:34,525
Someone like you...

435
1926
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,471
I love you.

436
1930
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,479
How much?

437
1934
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:54,332
How much and for how long?

438
1938
00:41:55,727 --> 00:42:03,438
As high as the sky, as wide as the earth, until a bridge is built from the earth to the moon.

439
1942
00:42:07,737 --> 00:42:09,920
Are you moved?

440
1946
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:13,575
Did you do an Internet search?

441
1950
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:21,723
What?

442
1954
00:42:21,723 --> 00:42:24,172
Nothing.

443
1958
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,745
I wish I didn't tell you either.

444
1962
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:39,988
What is she doing there?

445
1966
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:44,323
Sam Soon

446
1970
00:42:44,323 --> 00:42:49,437
What are you doing out
here this late? Praying?

447
1975
00:42:52,595 --> 00:42:54,781
What's wrong with you?

448
1979
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,025
What's wrong?

449
1983
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:03,333
What's wrong, child?

450
1987
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,708
Mom...

451
1991
00:43:11,604 --> 00:43:13,634
Mother

452
1995
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:17,194
Tell me, is she seeing someone?
She broke up with him or what?

453
2000
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,495
How would I know?

454
2004
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,515
You two are always whispering.
How can you not know?

455
2009
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,696
This is really...

456
2013
00:43:22,696 --> 00:43:26,010
Last Christmas, she cried over
Hyun Woo for 3 days and 3 nights.

457
2018
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,935
Tell me, who is it?

458
2022
00:43:27,935 --> 00:43:30,421
I can't say it.

459
2026
00:43:30,421 --> 00:43:36,495
-I'll whip you into saying it
-Okay, I'll say it

460
2031
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,638
Yes, she's dating.

461
2035
00:43:42,638 --> 00:43:44,320
With whom?

462
2039
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,429
-I can't say
-Who is it!

463
2044
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:51,195
-Her boss
-Boss?

464
2049
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,141
The restaurant's boss?

465
2053
00:43:53,141 --> 00:43:56,641
Mother... Mother

466
2057
00:43:56,641 --> 00:44:00,251
What are you crying over? What are you crying over?

467
2061
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:02,378
Stop it!
It hurts, don't hit her.

468
2066
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:07,396
Why are you always
getting dumped!

469
2071
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:12,961
You've got hands and legs, but
why are you always getting dumped? Why?

470
2076
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:17,382
You're driving me nuts!

471
2080
00:44:21,678 --> 00:44:25,622
Stop crying and get up.
Where does he live?

472
2085
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:27,462
I want to know who he is.

473
2089
00:44:27,462 --> 00:44:31,297
What's so great about him? Why did he dump my daughter?
Get up and take me there. Hurry.

474
2094
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:33,083
Mom, you are going overboard.

475
2098
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:35,852
It's over. Why go see him?
It's pathetic.

476
2103
00:44:35,852 --> 00:44:37,731
Is this not pathetic?

477
2107
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:39,185
They should make a clean break.

478
2111
00:44:39,185 --> 00:44:41,466
Get up and quickly take me there.

479
2115
00:44:41,466 --> 00:44:45,692
Mom, it's over between them.

480
2119
00:44:45,692 --> 00:44:48,568
I've given him a thrashing. There's no need for you to be involved.

481
2123
00:44:48,568 --> 00:44:50,090
Let go!

482
2127
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,846
She's your sister.
Don't you care?

483
2132
00:44:52,846 --> 00:44:57,325
All you do is cry!
Now get up and go. Lead the way! Quickly

484
2137
00:44:57,325 --> 00:45:00,663
Mom, I know I'm wrong.

485
2141
00:45:00,663 --> 00:45:02,832
Sister! Sister!

486
2145
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:04,694
--Enough!
-- Hurry and get up!

487
2150
00:45:04,694 --> 00:45:07,322
It's a contractual relationship.

488
2154
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:12,694
It'll only embarrass us.

489
2158
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,200
So don't go.

490
2162
00:45:21,669 --> 00:45:23,817
Contract?

491
2166
00:45:25,512 --> 00:45:28,855
Mother, I was wrong!

492
2170
00:45:28,855 --> 00:45:31,932
I won't do it again!

493
2174
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,742
Is it President Park?

494
2178
00:45:56,742 --> 00:45:58,888
I'm calling from the Miller's.

495
2182
00:45:58,888 --> 00:46:00,987
Can you help us sell our house?

496
2186
00:46:00,987 --> 00:46:04,207
-Mother
-As fast as impossible.

497
2191
00:46:04,207 --> 00:46:06,330
Are you crazy?
Why are you selling the house?

498
2196
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,645
Give it back.

499
2200
00:46:10,589 --> 00:46:15,360
I'd rather stake out in a tent
than live like this.

500
2205
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,793
What?

501
2209
00:46:16,793 --> 00:46:19,627
You'll do anything
for 50 million won?

502
2214
00:46:19,627 --> 00:46:24,101
Instead of giving birth to you... if I'd laid a pumpkin, at least I could eat soup.

503
2218
00:46:24,101 --> 00:46:28,600
You're the smart one. How could you
let your sis end up like "Shim Chung".

504
2223
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,127
[Korean folktale Shim Chung,devoted daughter sacrifices herself to marry the Sea Dragon King so that her blind father may see]

505
2227
00:46:32,127 --> 00:46:34,567
That means the restaurant
is the dragon palace.

506
2232
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:38,924
-And Sam Shik is the Sea Dragon King
-Look at mom's hair.

507
2237
00:46:38,924 --> 00:46:42,545
How can you laugh
at a time like this?

508
2242
00:46:42,545 --> 00:46:45,926
Sam Soon, don't work
there anymore.

509
2247
00:46:59,506 --> 00:47:01,854
I'm sorry, we're not open yet.

510
2251
00:47:01,854 --> 00:47:04,132
Where's your President?

511
2255
00:47:04,132 --> 00:47:06,437
Ask your President here.
Where is he?

512
2260
00:47:06,437 --> 00:47:07,964
And you are...?

513
2264
00:47:07,964 --> 00:47:10,999
Are you the President?
Step aside if you aren't.

514
2269
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:13,959
Where's the President?
Get out here now.

515
2274
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:18,089
Are you coming out or not?
Don't blow things up, come on out.

516
2279
00:47:18,089 --> 00:47:19,973
May I ask who are you?

517
2283
00:47:19,973 --> 00:47:22,486
Madam, are you the President? You're not the President.

518
2287
00:47:22,486 --> 00:47:24,811
I'm the restaurant manager.

519
2291
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:27,864
The President is unavailable.
Please speak with me.

520
2296
00:47:27,864 --> 00:47:29,776
I'm not here to see you.
Get your President out here.

521
2301
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:33,940
He hasn't come to work yet..
You can talk to me about it.

522
2306
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:36,151
Then I'll wait.
Where's his office?

523
2311
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:40,810
First, please tell us your name
and what you are here for.

524
2316
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,554
I have nothing to
say to you, Madam.

525
2321
00:47:42,554 --> 00:47:44,935
It's not Madam,
it's Manager.

526
2326
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:47,976
Did I ask you?

527
2330
00:47:47,976 --> 00:47:51,335
What's with the Cleopatra hairstyle...

528
2334
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:55,901
-Is the office there?
-You can't go in.

529
2339
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:59,486
--Let go of me.
 --Please show the guest out.

530
2344
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:04,717
Let go of me, you ruffians!

531
2348
00:48:06,013 --> 00:48:08,301
Let go of me!

532
2352
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:26,671
What's going on?

533
2356
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,535
You're the President?

534
2360
00:48:28,535 --> 00:48:29,936
Yes

535
2364
00:48:29,936 --> 00:48:31,944
You jerk!

536
2368
00:48:33,231 --> 00:48:35,986
You dumped my daughter?

537
2372
00:48:35,986 --> 00:48:41,386
You're gonna get it from me!
How can you do that to your staff?

538
2377
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:43,858
You stand still, you bad person.

539
2381
00:48:43,858 --> 00:48:46,170
Madam, what are you doing?
Who are you?

540
2386
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,210
How old are you?
You're still wet behind the ears.

541
2391
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:52,340
One of those people with money making fun of others. Did your mother teach you that?

542
2395
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,547
Madam! Madam!

543
2399
00:48:53,547 --> 00:48:59,752
What are you hollering about?
How dare you dump my daughter!

544
2404
00:49:09,684 --> 00:49:14,303
Don't you dare do it.
Let go of him!

545
2409
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:23,868
How dare you
challenge Park Bong Sook

546
2414
00:49:23,868 --> 00:49:27,322
Get out.
Get out now!

547
2419
00:49:52,417 --> 00:49:54,591
Mother!

548
2423
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:01,187
Mother, are you crazy?
Why did you come here?

549
2428
00:50:01,187 --> 00:50:04,412
You are embarrassing us!

550
2432
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:06,485
Let go!

551
2436
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:24,376
Why didn't you return my jeans?

552
2440
00:50:24,376 --> 00:50:26,025
Why? You ate it?

553
2444
00:50:26,025 --> 00:50:30,019
-Sam Soon didn't give it to you?
-Sam Soon giving it to me?'  Oh Really!

554
2449
00:50:30,019 --> 00:50:32,680
But I need to wear it tonight.

555
2453
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,852
Sorry then,
I'll bring it next time.

556
2458
00:50:34,852 --> 00:50:36,329
Next time?

557
2462
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:41,279
But I have to wear it today.
Those are my 'lucky' pants.

558
2467
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,591
That's the only pair you have?

559
2471
00:50:43,591 --> 00:50:47,016
I have lots of them,
but I want to wear that one tonight.

560
2476
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:48,735
I have to.

561
2480
00:50:48,735 --> 00:50:50,280
Take this away!

562
2484
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,132
Jeans are all the same,
just wear another pair.

563
2489
00:50:54,132 --> 00:50:59,858
Miss, you're really...
I'll wear what I want.

564
2494
00:50:59,858 --> 00:51:03,530
I don't care, you have
to return it tonight.

565
2499
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:04,511
And come here again?

566
2503
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:11,735
You're pretty thick-skinned. I don't care if you come 2 or 3 times,
It's your fault, so just bring it here.

567
2508
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,393
Tonight at 9. It's a must.

568
2512
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,270
Hey, wait! Hey!

569
2516
00:51:22,202 --> 00:51:24,877
That fella.

570
2520
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:27,366
Just my luck.

571
2524
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:41,104
This is the deed for our house.

572
2528
00:51:41,104 --> 00:51:43,513
Mother.

573
2532
00:51:43,513 --> 00:51:47,832
We can't pay back the 50 million now.
We don't have the money now.

574
2537
00:51:47,832 --> 00:51:50,643
You can take this as collateral.

575
2541
00:51:50,643 --> 00:51:52,817
This...You don't have to do this.

576
2545
00:51:52,817 --> 00:51:55,296
According to who? According to you?

577
2549
00:51:55,296 --> 00:51:57,288
I've settled the money
issue with Sam Soon.

578
2554
00:51:57,288 --> 00:52:00,025
-That we don't have to pay back?
-Yes

579
2559
00:52:00,025 --> 00:52:01,126
You jerk!

580
2563
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:03,533
Mom, you're doing it again?

581
2567
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:07,074
You "played" her, and you want to
shrug her aside with 50 million?

582
2572
00:52:07,074 --> 00:52:11,227
-It's not like that
-But it's what your words mean!

583
2577
00:52:13,287 --> 00:52:14,805
Please calm down.

584
2581
00:52:14,805 --> 00:52:20,658
Mom, calm down.
Sit down and talk.  Quickly.

585
2586
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:25,269
Keep this safe.

586
2590
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:30,079
I'll return the money once my
daughter sells her apartment, get it?

587
2595
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,551
Yes.

588
2599
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:36,509
Sam Soon won't be working
here starting from today.

589
2604
00:52:45,794 --> 00:52:48,351
Not leaving?

590
2608
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:51,764
Wait for me outside.
I've something to say.

591
2613
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:54,391
What's there to talk about with this lustful jerk?

592
2617
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,073
Mother.

593
2621
00:53:09,073 --> 00:53:11,924
-Let's go.
-Where's Sam Soon?

594
2626
00:53:11,924 --> 00:53:14,739
I should've given birth to a son.

595
2630
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:16,538
Why are you talking about this?

596
2634
00:53:16,538 --> 00:53:19,823
If it's a son, he won't
let that jerk off so easily.

597
2639
00:53:19,823 --> 00:53:22,299
Here we go again with the story of why you should have had a son.

598
2643
00:53:25,146 --> 00:53:30,605
Please excuse my actions earlier.
Goodbye.

599
2648
00:53:33,103 --> 00:53:35,890
Sorry about that, goodbye.

600
2652
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:46,372
-You know what this is, right?
-How could you be such a loose-lipped woman?

601
2657
00:53:46,372 --> 00:53:48,380
Shouldn't you have
kept this from your family?

602
2662
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,706
Did you think I told my mom?

603
2666
00:53:50,706 --> 00:53:53,264
That I sold myself
for 50 million won?

604
2671
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:55,466
How many people in this
world would say that?

605
2676
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:56,920
Fine, enough of that.

606
2680
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,420
Keep your promise and stay 2 weeks.
I won't accept your resignation until then.

607
2685
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,199
Do you always think of yourself?

608
2689
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,091
You have some place to go
if you resign?

609
2694
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:12,093
I'll find something.

610
2698
00:54:13,094 --> 00:54:16,349
How about this, let's pretend
nothing happened today.

611
2703
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:19,054
You may be able to do it,
but I can't.

612
2708
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:22,103
-My mom will kill me
-Try it and see if she kills you.

613
2713
00:54:22,103 --> 00:54:23,652
Are you toying with
someone's life?

614
2718
00:54:23,652 --> 00:54:25,300
-Miss Kim Sam Soon
-What?

615
2723
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,504
Is this an amusement park?
Coming and going as you please?

616
2728
00:54:28,504 --> 00:54:32,865
In situations like this, do you what
Priestess Park Bong Sook will say?

617
2733
00:54:32,865 --> 00:54:35,600
You're blaming someone else for your own fart!

618
2737
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,613
Anyways, I'm quitting as of today

619
2741
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,906
<i>[ Kim Sam-soon ]</i>

620
2745
00:55:41,217 --> 00:55:42,868
Sister.

621
2749
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:47,416
You're really quitting?

622
2753
00:55:48,767 --> 00:55:51,845
You can't work here just
because you broke off with him?

623
2758
00:55:51,845 --> 00:55:56,235
No, it's not like that.

624
2762
00:55:56,235 --> 00:55:58,838
There are other reasons.

625
2766
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,850
I feel sorry for you though.

626
2770
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:11,724
What should I do now?

627
2774
00:56:14,049 --> 00:56:16,803
Here, take this.

628
2778
00:56:16,803 --> 00:56:18,502
What's this?

629
2782
00:56:18,502 --> 00:56:23,573
These are notes on cake-making.
It should be useful to you.

630
2787
00:56:23,573 --> 00:56:27,846
This book is important to me.
You have to return it.

631
2792
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:55,558
I can't say goodbye to everyone,
so don't send me off.

632
2797
00:56:56,493 --> 00:56:58,912
Don't come out.
