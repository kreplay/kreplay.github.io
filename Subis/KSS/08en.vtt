<i>Episode 8
Dad, why is it hard for me to fall in love?</i>

2
8
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:21,860
For the prawn dish grilled with garlic, 
 which I just ordered ...

3
13
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:26,795
What wine would go best with it? I don't know.

4
17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,500
Well eating a dish with something as strong as garlic
 will detract from the  flavor of the wine.

5
22
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,300
To maintain the garlic flavour, without sacrificing the taste of the wine ,
 I would recommend a dry white wine.

6
27
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:39,297
Bordeaux and Malmo,

7
31
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,100
Moebius?

8
35
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:43,500
How about Muscadet?

9
39
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,966
Ah, Muscadet. Bordeaux and Muscadet are both good choices, Sir.

10
43
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,100
What do you think , Darling?

11
47
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:53,141
We are testing them, let's pretend,
we're husband and wife

12
52
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,800
Don't you have any other wine?

13
56
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,340
Pardon?

14
60
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:02,200
I don't like to drink these two,
is there any other wine?

15
65
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:06,328
You don't know?

16
69
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:09,500
What wine do you lot think
will go best with this dish?

17
74
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:12,358
Rose wine?

18
78
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:13,900
Rose wine?

19
82
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,607
That's right, Rose wine is also suitable.

20
86
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:18,870
Rose wine would be better if it were iced.

21
90
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,800
Pardon?

22
94
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,335
We can't choose this one because
my darling is pregnant.

23
99
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:30,000
Next one

24
103
00:01:31,798 --> 00:01:33,852
You call this fighting?

25
107
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:38,347
If you wanna hit him, then
use all your strength!

26
112
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,900
That's right, you should hit like that.

27
116
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,800
It means much more if there is blood.

28
120
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:48,990
Kill!

29
124
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,880
Hit him!

30
128
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,500
Hitting what? Who do you want dead?

31
132
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:59,130
There was a time when you were
interested in bull fighting,
why don't you watch that anymore?

32
138
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,410
Now days I enjoy dogfighting.

33
142
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:06,392
There's a competition at Sung Nam
this Sunday, you wanna go watch?

34
147
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,787
I'm sorry, my bad.

35
151
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:13,737
-Tell the manager to come in
-By the way, I heard Jin Hyun hasn't been at work for last 3 days.

36
156
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:15,273
3 days?

37
160
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:16,500
Why?

38
164
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,300
Are you sick?

39
168
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:35,564
Come sit here! Sit here

40
172
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,811
What's happened?

41
176
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:42,084
I haven't asked her yet

42
180
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,872
What has happened exactly?

43
184
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:47,202
What could happen?

44
188
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:52,130
This proves that the ugly duckling
will stay an ugly duckling
and won't become a swan.

45
194
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,959
Does that mean Sam Soon
Unni got dumped?

46
199
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,035
You won't know if it's liquid
or solid until you've eaten it.

47
204
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,900
Stop saying things you don't
know, don't guess.

48
209
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
You haven't been in love before have you?

49
213
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,900
Yes.

50
217
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,300
When the man dissappears and the woman gets dark circles under her eyes, It's over.

51
221
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:21,104
Hey, you think this time it will be your turn?

52
225
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:23,442
There's nothing that says that I can't be a swan.

53
229
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:29,300
Stop kidding around.

54
233
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,637
The swan is someone else.

55
237
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:32,726
Is it the woman who came the other day?

56
241
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:34,776
fNo, It's me.

81
343
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,400
Has she got a boyfriend lately?

82
347
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,000
No, how could she?

83
351

It can't be..

84
355

Anyway, something doesn't feel right,
she's gotten slimmer lately.

430

<i>What? Are you sick?

00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,460
But, are you not sick?

106
447
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:48,000
Are you or aren't you asking me to come?

107
451
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,463
I'm so worried..

108
455
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:56,437
So worried....

109
459
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:16,764
--Help me to translate will you?
--What is it?

110
464
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:20,203
The hospital  records for Hee Jin from America.

111
468
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,561
It's about Hee Jin's treatments,
even including the MRI and  CT reports.

112
473
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:25,500
Did he bring all this over?

113
477
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes, it couldn't have been easy
to get his hands on these.

114
482
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,123
These reports have become
a great help to us,
my superior told me to thank you.

115
488
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:43,525
--Thank you very much for bringing all this.
--Okay.

116
493
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,213
Please extend our appreciation to the physician in charge.

117
497
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:50,600
Not at all.

118
501
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,021
Can you really do the tests here?

119
505
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,513
Look who's talking..

120
509
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,400
Our hospital is the best, even
on treatment of the gastrointestinal 
system is well known.

121
515
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,540
We had a genius from the US 
surgical department who
joined us last year, didn't you know?

122
521
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,810
I guess because Hee Jin's parents are there, she went.

123
525
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:34,668
I didn't know she would be so cruel,
leaving without saying a single word to anyone

124
530
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:36,689
Would it come back again?

125
534
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:38,784
It could come back in 2 years time.

126
538
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:43,130
The chances of it coming
back after 6 years is low.

127
543
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,210
Can she fully recover after 5 years?

128
547
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,611
It's possible, but it could
come back after 5 years.

129
552
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,730
Don't worry.

130
556
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,720
It's definite it is in remission now.

131
560
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,540
Hee Jin has a strong will to live.

132
564
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Plus we have our top doctor with us.

133
568
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,200
You just need to take care of her now.

134
572
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,000
When are you leaving?

135
576
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,700
I have no plans yet to leave.

136
580
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:25,800
How long is your vacation?

137
584
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,600
I have five months left.

138
588
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,735
Have you ever been to Japan?

139
592
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,500
Hmm.  I was in Tokyo and Osaka.

140
596
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,746
What about China?

141
600
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:44,000
Not yet.

142
604
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,485
Why don't you visit there?

143
608
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:48,519
I'll pay for everything.

144
612
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,600
Why are you paying for everything?

145
616
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,963
To thank you for taking care of Hee Jin all this time.

146
620
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:58,423
Okay, look.  I'm just doing my job. Okay?

147
624
00:12:58,423 --> 00:13:00,383
So thank you but, no thanks.

148
628
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
That's rude.

149
632
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,434
In Korean custom you should accept.

150
636
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  But I'll think about it.

151
640
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,300
Great.  I'll call my travel agent to get started.

152
644
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:18,508
By the way, tell Sophie...

153
648
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:21,208
thank you for recommending this book.

154
652
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,288

00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:25,147
Sophie
- Yeah, Sophie.

156
661
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,811
Hey
-Hey.

157
666
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,327
How was it?
Good.

158
671
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,930
Are you okay?  You sure?

159
675
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,354
Okay?

160
679
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,900
Let's go

161
683
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,000
Let's drink to the beauty
of the 3 of us, cheers! One shot?

162
688
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,780
Why is the beer so sweet today?

163
692
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,300
Our mum's intake is not bad today!

164
696
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:00,600
Eat up, they're getting scorched

165
700
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,426
Why aren't you eating?

166
704
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,100
I am.

167
708
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,428
What's wrong?

168
712
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:09,276
Nothing.

169
716
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,200
You could eat a lot more, but what's
wrong with you today?

170
721
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:19,396
I don't feel like eating.

171
725
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:22,600
Just leave her alone, she needs
to lose weight anyway.

172
730
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,000
-The phone!
-You eat, I'll get it.

173
735
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,200
What you doing?!
 Tell me the truth, what's going on?

174
740
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,820
Since you went to Jejudo, you've been strange.

175
744
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,000
Did something happen between
you and Sam Shik?

176
749
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,564
He hasn't come to work for 4 days now.

177
753
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:56,827
Why?

178
757
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:58,765
That's why I'm like this, because I don't know.

179
761
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
He didn't phone?

180
765
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:04,315
I think he only talked to Manager Oh.

181
769
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,000
Then what's wrong? He hasn't
gone missing you know.

182
774
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,800
I miss him.

183
778
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,500
I'm missing him like crazy.

184
782
00:15:29,216 --> 00:15:30,000
Really?

185
786
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,719
She's recently lost a bit of weight
so she looks better now.

186
791
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:37,100
She's quite tall.

187
795
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,600
She's curvy
more like me, you know!

188
800
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,100
She's only a little bit fat, if you look
closely, she's a real beauty!

189
805
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:49,321
So that's why you need to help
me find someone for her.

190
810
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:51,219
This won't do.

191
814
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:53,070
Sam Shik can never be the one.

192
818
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,465
Why?

193
822
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,146
Look at Young Suk.

194
826
00:15:56,146 --> 00:15:58,500
You know that when she married a rich guy,
people all got get envious of her.

195
831
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,030
Do you know how she is at the
moment? You don't even know.

196
836
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,810
How is she living?

197
840
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:04,512
I won't go into the details.

198
844
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:07,395
She said that rich people's thinking
is different from us.

199
849
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:13,267
We don't know what they are thinking,
and they don't even want to know what we are thinking.

200
854
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:15,721
Anyway. they probably think that's wise of them.

201
858
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:19,433
The problem is, some people
really want to become rich.

202
863
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:21,884
I hope my sister does not think like that.

203
867
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:23,900
Aren't you the same Sis?

204
871
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,600
What did I do?

205
875
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,160
Didn't you get married after meeting
him for a couple of days?
 He's not that rich even!

206
881
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,800
He's not even that rich!

207
885
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,000
He's not a chaebol.  And I lived according to my principles.

208
889
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,700
So you say you were being sincere even
though you got married because he was rich

209
894
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,950
Oh, really.

210
898
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:43,073
People do have their own principles,  When you make choices according to those principles, you weigh them.

211
902
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:49,041
And my principle is to choose
someone who has ability. 
 Don't judge me who followed my own principles.

212
908
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,834
If you wer following your principles,
then why did you get divorced?

213
913
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,600
That is not the  important problem right now.

214
917
00:16:55,569 --> 00:17:00,000
Have you possibly slept with Sam Shik?

215
921
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,700
No.

216
925
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,364
--Just kissed.
--Kissed?

217
930
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:10,218
I'm sorry, we only kissed once.

218
934
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:12,217
If you're sorry you kissed...

219
938
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:15,588
What happened afterwards? Did
he say he wanted to date you?

220
943
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:17,236
He didn't say anything? 
 I think it's about Yoo Hee Jin.

221
948
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,900
I think it is about Hee Jin.

222
952
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:24,255
Yoo Hee Jin?

223
956
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,800
--His ex-girlfriend?
Yeah.

224
961
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:29,404
That's why he hasn't come to work

225
965
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
You're finished!

226
969
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:36,799
You're finished now! You dummy!

227
973
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:40,834
Look at you...

228
977
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:43,900
You can't like him!

229
981
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:48,340
I started to like him when he laid down on my stomach.

230
985
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,430
Your stomach?

231
989
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:58,600
He said, he smiles whenever he looks at me, 
and talked about his brother and even cried.

232
994
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,804
He cried in my arms

233
998
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:05,401
Doesn't that mean he likes
me when he was like that?

234
1003
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:09,421
No. I have a guy friend who cries
everytime when he gets a girl.

235
1008
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,068
And when he's crying, he starts to tell
the girl all about his family history.

236
1013
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:15,052
When he uses a ploy on women like you, that is saying he likes you?

237
1017
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,800
No

238
1021
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,500
Sam Shik is not that kind of person

239
1025
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,654
Sam Shik is exactly that kind of person!

240
1029
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:24,018
Even a stray dog will laugh at this old girl.

241
1033
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:29,932
He's probably with some other girl right
now telling his brother's story.

242
1038
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:31,059
No!

243
1042
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:32,900
No! Sam Shik is not that kind of person!

244
1046
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,700
Wake up! You dummy!

245
1050
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:35,955
Why are you hitting me?

246
1054
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,412
Don't fool yourself.

247
1058
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:40,927
You've reached this situation now,
you still don't understand?

248
1063
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:44,400
Why do people who don't know how
to love do the same things!

249
1068
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,391
Yes! You're right! I don't know how to love!

250
1072
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,600
You're good! You're the love expert!

251
1076
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,800
A person's beauty is a gift
from God, so what?

252
1081
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,810
How can you be so cruel?!

253
1085
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,313
No, I can't, I'm afraid you will hurt even more!

254
1089
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:56,776
You've been had.  Your heart is going to break.

255
1093
00:18:56,776 --> 00:18:59,440
Right! All your geese are swans!

256
1097
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,083
What are you saying..!

257
1101
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,580
I've suffered one beating already,
I'm not gonna take another one!

258
1106
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,100
How dare you mess with me?

259
1110
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,476
Let go now!

260
1114
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:08,018
Am I a fool?

261
1118
00:19:08,018 --> 00:19:10,319
You'll hit me if I let go!

262
1122
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,793
You've been stupid from childhood,  
How long do I have to clean up after you? Do you know?

263
1127
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:18,937
What have you given me? You
always took the best food first,
wore the prettiest clothes first!

264
1133
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:22,856
You ate so well, ate so full,
I've given you all the food!

265
1138
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:25,600
It's because you that I never had chance to learn the piano,
 that I couldn't go to college because of you!

266
1143
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:28,653
Because you couldn't study, was that my fault?

267
1147
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:32,574
When I went to France to study,
did you give me any money?!

268
1152
00:19:32,574 --> 00:19:36,046
There were so many peaches I wanted to eat.

269
1156
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:38,183
You think you haven't eaten it, then I have?!

270
1160
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,312
Have you ever introduced a man to me?

271
1164
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,780
Did you think heaven would make you thinner?

272
1168
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,180
Were you afraid your mother would get bored so you threw a party?

273
1172
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,901
What more do you have to say
since you're divorced?!

274
1177
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:57,834
You! You're not even married yet but
you keep on getting blinded by love!

275
1182
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:06,013
The two of you don't even
consider about me!!

276
1187
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,900
Oh the meat's getting scorched!

277
1191
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:14,834
Anyway, Sam Shik is a definite no.

278
1195
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:15,557
He is.

279
1199
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:18,400
-No
 - Is this any of your business?!

280
1204
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,300
You! Because you're my sister!

281
1208
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,642
Then lend me money to buy a dress.

282
1212
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,000
If you don't lend me, I won't speak to you!

283
1216
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:43,900
Except to see Sam Shik, I can let
you borrow it anytime you want!

284
1221
00:20:46,782 --> 00:20:49,200
But can you fit in it?

285
1225
00:20:53,748 --> 00:20:55,797
I love you!

<i>I don't like it.</i>

304
1301
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Yes, you're  crazy.

305
1305
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:46,588
<i>[ I miss you ]</i>

306
1309
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,600
I miss you.

307
1313
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:45,463
Are you really sick?

308
1317
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,874
I brought you some congee.

309
1321
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:54,322
It's sesame congee that my mum used to make for me when I was sick, it smells really nice.

310
1325
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:56,187
I even brought the millefleur that I made.

311
1329
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:04,100
It's like the bark of a tree, it
comes off layer after layer.

312
1334
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,900
It's one of the most delicious!

313
1338
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,900
Where are you feeling sick?

314
1342
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,700
Why are you sick?

315
1346
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,900
I'm sorry if I woke you.

316
1350
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,700
Are you really sick?

317
1354
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,200
I made some congee, it's sesame congee.

318
1358
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,700
This is 100% sesame.

319
1362
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,500
I also made millefleur.

320
1366
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,700
Who is it?

321
1370
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,100
Who's come so early?

322
1374
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,700
Thank you for being so concerned
about me, I will enjoy it.

323
1379
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,300
You brought congee? This early?

324
1383
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,700
Miss Kim Hee Jin.

325
1387
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
I'm sorry.

326
1391
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,500
For what?

327
1395
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,300
I'm just sorry.

328
1399
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,000
Are you sick?

329
1403
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:36,800
Do you still remember
part 6 to our contract?

330
1408
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,900
Fooling around is prohibited for both parties!

331
1412
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,000
Terminate the contract, you jerk!

332
1416
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,200
Are you ok?

333
1420
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,700
I...

334
1424
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,941
I'm starting  all over with Hee Jin.

335
1428
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,200
I could see that.

336
1432
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:33,957
Congratulations.

337
1436
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:37,951
Then let's terminate the contract.

338
1440
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,100
Fine.

339
1444
00:32:45,082 --> 00:32:49,229
It was me who first broke the contract,
so you don't need to repay
back the 50 million won.

340
1450
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,500
You don't have to pay...

341
1454
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:06,400
Hey! Do you think 50 million won
can buy someone's heart?

342
1459
00:33:10,081 --> 00:33:13,368
If it was going to be like this, you shouldn't
have said the things at Jeju Island.

343
1464
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:17,835
You shouldn't have said "don't look at other guy, don't listen to other guy" thing.

344
1468
00:33:19,228 --> 00:33:22,793
Did you have to do that?  Are you a player?

345
1472
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:29,900
Fine, even if I did understand
why you did what you did..

346
1477
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,800
..But why did you say you wanted to
go to Hallyu mountain with me?

347
1482
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,200
I don't think you know but..

348
1486
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,700
...that...

349
1490
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,200
..That sentence..

350
1494
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,800
..That sentence is meaning
 "I liked you", did you know that?

351
1499
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:07,375
If it was gonna turn out like this, you shouldn't have said to methat you wanted to go to Mount Hallyu  together

352
1503
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,800
Why are you throwing a rock in a calm lake?
Why? Why? Why? You bastard.

353
1508
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:37,936
That's why I don't want the
50 million won back.

354
1513
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:47,303
Is my body worth 50 million won?

355
1517
00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:49,715
Is my heart worth 50 million won?

356
1521
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Were you just playing around with me?

357
1525
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,188
Fine

358
1529
00:34:56,188 --> 00:34:58,100
I'll take it

359
1533
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,500
I won't repay you the 50
million won, is that ok?

360
1538
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,500
Yes.

361
1542
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,400
Also..

362
1546
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,600
I want to cancel that sentence.

363
1550
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:15,860
The sentence when I said I liked you.

364
1554
00:35:17,268 --> 00:35:19,625
I'm sorry, that was a mistake.

365
1558
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,000
I was being sincere.

366
1562
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,800
When I said to go to Halla
mountain together

367
1567
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:33,973
Someday I still want to go with you

368
1571
00:35:33,973 --> 00:35:36,000
That's the truth.

369
1575
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,800
Why?

370
1579
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:44,488
You want me to carry you up the mountain
when your leg starts to hurt?

371
1584
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,900
Yeh, I guess that's one of the reasons

372
1588
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,200
You think it's funny?

373
1592
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,300
You think it's funny joking around with me?

374
1596
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Go to Halla mountain
with Miss Yoo Hee Jin.

375
1601
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,568
Miss Kim Sam Soon! Are you ok?

376
1605
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,100
Miss Kim Sam Soon!

377
1609
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,400
Wake up!

378
1613
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,600
Miss Kim Sam Soon, wake up!

379
1617
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,500
Miss Kim Sam Soon!

380
1621
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:54,457
I didn't hit her.

381
1625
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:57,566
She fell herself.

382
1629
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,300
It's true.

383
1633
00:36:59,414 --> 00:37:03,318
Miss Kim Sam Soon, wake up!

384
1637
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,300
Miss Kim Sam Soon!

385
1641
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:28,750
What did they say?

386
1645
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,500
Why? Are you worried now?

387
1649
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,000
Who wouldn't be worried?

388
1653
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,301
Don't try to lie!

389
1657
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,900
Don't worry, she didn't faint,
she's just fallen asleep

390
1662
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:48,931
I guess she was up all night worrying about
you that she didn't get any sleep.

391
1667
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,100
Anyway, what were you guys talking about when you
said about terminating the contract?

392
1672
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,900
Oh that..that's..

393
1676
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,984
Sam Soon, Sam Soon!

394
1680
00:38:15,984 --> 00:38:19,513
What's this? What happened?

395
1684
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,300
What happened? She left
before the sun came up.

396
1689
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,600
Miss Hee Jin?

397
1693
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,300
Miss Hee Jin, I didn't think
you were like that! You really are something!

398
1698
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:46,521
Yi Young Unni!

399
1702
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,300
It's been a long time!

400
1706
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,400
So you had that kind of experience

401
1710
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,000
Fate is a funny thing, like
us meeting like this.

402
1715
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,900
I'm sorry.

403
1719
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,435
What for?

404
1723
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,200
Towards your sister.

405
1727
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,800
It's ok, since it wasn't a real relationship.

406
1731
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,230
<i>This is the first message.</i>

407
1735
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,600
<i>At the airport, where are you?</i>

408
1739
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,290
<i>Second</i>

409
1743
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,300
<i>Why aren't you answering your phone?
Aren't you getting on that plane?</i>

410
1748
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,160
<i>Third</i>

411
1752
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,866
<i>It's me.</i>

412
1756
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:59,092
<i>There's not much time left, you do
know you're in Jeju Island right?]</i>

413
1761
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:01,737
<i>It's the last flight back to Seoul today.</i>

414
1765
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,300
<i>Are you on your way here now?</i>

415
1769
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:05,910
<i>Fourth</i>

416
1773
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,824
<i>Did you get my message?</i>

417
1777
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:09,950
<i>It's the flight at 9:15pm</i>

418
1781
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,700
<i>You have to get here before 9pm.</i>

419
1785
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,800
<i>I wanted to thank you for telling
me earlier about your brother.</i>

420
1790
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,000
<i>In return I wanted to tell you about my dad.</i>

421
1794
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,200
<i>My dad...Miller President Kim</i>

422
1798
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,700
<i>I didn't go to my dad's funeral.</i>

423
1802
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,150
<i>It happened so suddenly, there was no flight.</i>

424
1806
00:40:45,688 --> 00:40:50,684
<i>The last time I saw him
was at Kimpo airport</i>

425
1811
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,600
<i>This was before Incheon airport opened.</i>

426
1815
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:00,900
<i>He said my daughter needs to leave now,
and he gave me a lot of rice cakes.</i>

427
1820
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,400
<i>But I lost my temper.</i>

428
1824
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,300
<i>So old-fashioned!I said  "Who needs
to bring rice cakes!"</i>

429
1829
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,800
<i>But..If I had known that was going to
be the last time we spoke..</i>

430
1834
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,900
<i>'Dad, I will enjoy them!'</i>

431
1838
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,000
<i>'Dad, I will come back healthy.'</i>

432
1842
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:33,368
<i>'Dad, take care of yourself'
That's what I would've said.</i>

433
1847
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,803
<i>Anyway, thanks for telling
me earlier about your brother.</i>

434
1852
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,060
Don't go.

435
1856
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,100
<i>Don't go!</i>

436
1860
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,800
<i>I've come to like you.</i>

437
1864
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,310
♫ <i> Inside my heart </i> ♫

438
1868
00:42:26,314 --> 00:42:28,421
I say I've come to like you! You jerk!

439
1872
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,850
♫  You, who are shining in the sky ♫

440
1876
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,730
<i>Don't go. 
 ♫Inside your heart ♫ </i>

441
1881
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,000
<i> ♫ Now, I am waiting.  ♫ </i>

442
1885
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,400
<i>If you leave now..</i>

443
1889
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:53,920
<i> ♫   In my longing for you, I am crying.  ♫  </i>

444
1893
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,100
Don't go!

445
1897
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,200
Don't go.

446
1901
00:43:11,634 --> 00:43:13,469
-Miss Kim Sam Soon!
-Don't go!

447
1906
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,800
Miss Kim Sam Soon!

448
1910
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,800
You didn't go?

449
1914
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,300
Have you slept enough?

450
1918
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,782
I'll take you home.

451
1922
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,208
Who's car is it? 
 Mine, let's go.

452
1927
00:44:08,986 --> 00:44:11,067
You're not coming?

453
1931
00:44:12,654 --> 00:44:14,626
Where's my bike?

454
1935
00:44:14,626 --> 00:44:16,800
It's in my apartment.

455
1939
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:21,851
Get in, please get in.

456
1943
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:27,659
Let' s take a taxi.

457
1947
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,600
Aren't you very tired? Let's go together

458
1951
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,300
Sis, let's go

459
1955
00:44:54,874 --> 00:44:58,111
Miss Hee Jin, can you turn around?

460
1959
00:44:58,111 --> 00:44:59,313
Pardon?

461
1963
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,200
Please turn around.

462
1967
00:45:04,103 --> 00:45:05,124
President Hyun

463
1971
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:07,012
Yes.

464
1975
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:14,602
If you keep on pestering my sister,
see what I'll do to you!

465
1980
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,900
I'm sorry, Miss Hee Jin.

466
1984
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,600
You deserved that.

467
1988
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,853
What? A love contract?

468
1992
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,300
So when I wasn't around,
you put on a show?

469
1997
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,666
Hello

470
2001
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:44,080
It's me, Secretary Yoon.

471
2005
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,100
Is Jin Hyun by your side?

472
2009
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:49,437
No, please speak.

473
2013
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,100
The president wants to see you,
please come over tonight.

474
2018
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,800
I'm sorry.

475
2022
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,400
I didn't fufill my responsibilities as a sister.

476
2026
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:10,639
I should've stopped this from the
beginning, I'm so disappointed.

477
2031
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:14,411
All this for 50 million won, that's nothing.

478
2035
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,600
He got a car.

479
2039
00:46:18,964 --> 00:46:21,565
He's driving now.

480
2043
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,700
What are you talking about?

481
2047
00:46:26,643 --> 00:46:30,217
That jerk is driving now.

482
2051
00:46:30,217 --> 00:46:32,567
He's driving.

483
2055
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,100
<i>I killed my brother.</i>

484
2059
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:47,953
<i>My brother looked tired, so I was driving.</i>

485
2063
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:56,100
<i>I killed my brother and my sister-in-law.</i>

486
2067
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,300
Come here..come here

487
2071
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,215
What's up? He got a car

488
2075
00:47:40,215 --> 00:47:42,677
He hasn't come here for days
now, how did he get a car?

489
2080
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,100
Did he use the car in the last 3-4 days?

490
2084
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,000
He really matches the car well.

491
2088
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:57,319
Hello President Hyun.

492
2092
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,700
It's so strange.

493
2096
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,300
There's seems to be a storm coming.

494
2100
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,800
Come in.

495
2104
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,900
Hello

496
2108
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,100
It's been  a long time..

497
2112
00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:34,220
Just wait here for a bit, she'll be right out.

498
2116
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,873
What would you like to drink?

499
2120
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,500
Water please

500
2124
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Hot or cold?

501
2128
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,200
Cold please

502
2132
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,500
Cold water..

503
2136
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,700
It's Mi Joo, isn't it?

504
2140
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,000
You're getting prettier!

505
2144
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,700
Do you remember me?

506
2148
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,900
That's right, you were so little back then.

507
2152
00:49:31,489 --> 00:49:34,049
So pretty, just like your mum

508
2156
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,200
Mi Joo, go inside.

509
2160
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,100
What are you doing Mi Joo? Go inside.

510
2164
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,300
Sit.

511
2168
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:11,456
I heard it all from your mum, was
the operation successful?

512
2173
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,000
Yes.

513
2177
00:50:13,098 --> 00:50:15,188
That's a relief

514
2181
00:50:15,188 --> 00:50:19,691
You should've contacted me
first when you came back. Why didn't you?

515
2186
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:22,300
I wanted to wait a while
before contacting you

516
2191
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,600
Have you been seeing Jin Hyun lately?

517
2195
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,500
Yes

518
2199
00:50:26,544 --> 00:50:28,645
How much does Jin Hyun know?

519
2203
00:50:28,645 --> 00:50:30,956
He only knows it was my decision to leave.

520
2207
00:50:30,956 --> 00:50:33,646
You said  it like I pushed you away.

521
2211
00:50:33,646 --> 00:50:37,408
No, I thought I did the right thing.

522
2215
00:50:37,408 --> 00:50:40,492
Mother, you didn't force me
to go, I understand that.

523
2220
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,000
You should not see him again.

524
2224
00:50:44,286 --> 00:50:46,847
I don't want a sick daughter-in-law.

525
2228
00:50:48,014 --> 00:50:48,991
Mother.

526
2232
00:50:48,991 --> 00:50:50,962
Don't call me that.

527
2236
00:50:50,962 --> 00:50:52,958
I wanted to say that to you
so I asked you to come.

528
2241
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,600
Stop seeing Jin Hyun.

529
2245
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,900
Didn't you say I could come
back once I recovered?

530
2250
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,808
Didn't you say I could see him again?

531
2254
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:08,300
It's strange how people's feelings can change.

532
2258
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,900
My heart has changed a lot

533
2262
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,500
Go back to America.

534
2266
00:51:19,948 --> 00:51:22,048
Your parents are already there.

535
2270
00:51:22,048 --> 00:51:25,622
You will have a bright future
if you graduate in America.

536
2275
00:51:25,622 --> 00:51:28,567
Why did you have to come back?

537
2279
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,400
Go back.

538
2283
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,300
Mother, you can't do this to me.

539
2287
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,300
Mother.

540
2291
00:51:44,138 --> 00:51:46,513
Didn't we make a promise together?

541
2295
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,300
Didn't we make an agreement?

542
2299
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,500
You have to understand
me, can you do that?

543
2304
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:16,700
My husband passed away very early..
 and lost both son & daughter-in-law who were so young.

544
2309
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,800
If you get sick again and it goes wrong,
I don't think I can live with that.

545
2314
00:52:24,573 --> 00:52:27,104
I won't get sick again, mother,
I'm fully recovered.

546
2319
00:52:27,104 --> 00:52:29,477
I can even eat without having
to take the tablets.

547
2324
00:52:29,477 --> 00:52:31,681
I had a scan yesterday.

548
2328
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:34,600
They said it's very clean inside,
there's nothing there.

549
2333
00:52:36,774 --> 00:52:38,675
I will work hard, Mother.

550
2337
00:52:38,675 --> 00:52:42,549
I will make Jin Hyun happy and we'll live like that forever.
 I will raise Mi Joo as well

551
2342
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:45,200
Can you accept me one more time? Please?

552
2346
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,000
No I can't.

553
2350
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,700
What can I do? What can I do?

554
2354
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,500
Go back.

555
2358
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,000
Return to your parents
side and live peacefully.

556
2363
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,900
Mother!

557
2367
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,061
You used to like me.

558
2371
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,534
You treated me as your own daughter!

559
2375
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,700
I do like you.

560
2379
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:16,924
Your parents have already immigrated..

561
2383
00:53:16,924 --> 00:53:19,627
..Why do you want to live
a hard life like this?

562
2388
00:53:19,627 --> 00:53:22,566
It's because of that, I don't like you anymore.

563
2392
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,117
I don't want another tragedy in my family.

564
2396
00:53:25,117 --> 00:53:27,545
I am fully recovered now!

565
2400
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,600
I have no feelings towards
you whatsoever now.

566
2405
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:47,290
♫ <i>Let me take the hands of my beautiful love, you. </i>  ♫

567
2409
00:53:47,290 --> 00:54:01,730
♫ <i>After  you come back to me again, it will be as beautiful as a flower song.</i>  ♫

568

00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:09,150
♫ <i> Love is still in place. </i>  ♫

♫ <i> Not once in parting could I say goodbye. </i>  ♫

574
2437
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:54,480
--Ahjumma, another!
-Yes.

575
2442
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,841
Auntie, please get me another bottle of Soju.

576
2446
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,400
Don't you see how busy I am! Get it yourself

577
2450
00:55:13,212 --> 00:55:17,210
I introduced so many customers here,
and this is how you treat me?

578
2455
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:20,200
I don't need you to get more customers.

579
2459
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,306
If you wanna come, come with
your husband next time.

580
2464
00:55:22,306 --> 00:55:25,950
Auntie, I don't have a husband.

581
2468
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,021
I'm just on my own.

582
2472
00:55:28,021 --> 00:55:31,235
Oh look at you..!

583
2476
00:55:31,235 --> 00:55:35,478
You said that when you were 20, and
10 years on, you're still saying it.

584
2481
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,900
So what?

585
2485
00:55:40,445 --> 00:55:41,817
Is this the city's soju?

586
2489
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,000
Don't you have soju from Chun Chon?

587
2493
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,400
Aren't they both the same soju?

588
2497
00:55:49,455 --> 00:55:52,757
How can you not know the difference
since you sell alcohol!

589
2502
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,900
The one from the city is sweet.

590
2506
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,200
The one from Chun Chon is bitter.

591
2510
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,483
My mood today is like the soju
from Chun Chon, bitter.

592
2515
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,200
What is wrong with you today?

593
2519
00:56:05,065 --> 00:56:06,666
Where did Yee Young go?

594
2523
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:07,768
Yee Young!

595
2527
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,900
She went to the toilet, I'll drink this one then.

596
2531
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,500
Dad.

597
2535
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,900
Dad, where did you go?

598
2539
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,300
I see you've come to annoy auntie again.

599
2543
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,500
Did you get dumped?

600
2547
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,400
Dad you really know me well.

601
2551
00:56:36,474 --> 00:56:41,462
I really want to go back to when I was 19.

602
2555
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,500
Didn't you start to teach
me how to drink? Dad?

603
2560
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,500
What kind of man is he this time?
Kind of man?

604
2565
00:56:54,046 --> 00:57:00,523
What kind of guy is he? He
has no manners at all.

605
2570
00:57:00,523 --> 00:57:03,331
He thinks he's some sort of prince.

606
2574
00:57:03,331 --> 00:57:06,359
He's selfish, conceited and a player.

607
2578
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:09,210
How could you like a guy like him?

608
2582
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,500
Yeah, I know.

609
2586
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,381
Dad, what can I do to teach him a lesson?

610
2590
00:57:16,381 --> 00:57:19,135
Teach him a lesson? He's not that lucky.

611
2594
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,997
Is there anyone else in this world besides our Sam Soon
who will become a great daughter-in-law?

612
2599
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Dad!

613
2603
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:25,630
It's really..

614
2607
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:30,284
If it was a few years back, then I
would've believed what you said.

615
2612
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,800
But I don't believe it now.

616
2616
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,407
I'm nearly hitting 30 now, 30!

617
2620
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,100
I now have my own piece of mind.

618
2624
00:57:40,656 --> 00:57:43,384
But you have to face the fact
that you got dumped.

619
2629
00:57:43,384 --> 00:57:45,343
What are you doing now?

620
2633
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,700
Dad, it seems like you don't understand

621
2637
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,200
Let's drink, you dummy.

622
2641
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,500
This soju sure is sweet!f

623
2645
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,600
Sweet soju..sweet..

624
2649
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,200
This is sweet..

625
2653
00:58:24,437 --> 00:58:27,300
I'm sorry, Dad.

626
2657
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,600
Sam Soon.

627
2661
00:58:33,686 --> 00:58:37,302
I'm so fraustrated!

628
2665
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:42,200
I thought I wouldn't cry over a man again.

629
2669
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,600
Dad

630
2673
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,600
I thought that after I turn 30, it
wouldn't be like this anymore.

631
2678
00:58:53,806 --> 00:58:57,159
I wouldn't feel my heart beating..

632
2682
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,100
..and there wouldn't be times when I'm
waiting all night for a phonecall..

633
2687
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,100
Dad, do you know how tiring that is?

634
2691
00:59:06,555 --> 00:59:09,702
I just want to find a guy who likes me.

635
2695
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:15,300
And one who wouldn't hurt my heart.

636
2699
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,300
Just live a normal life together,

637
2703
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,100
But look what's happened now.

638
2707
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,700
It's making me so disappointed..

639
2711
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,800
I've been through so much already..

640
2715
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,881
I still fell for a guy

641
2719
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,500
I feel so disappointed with
myself, so disappointed

642
2724
00:59:48,398 --> 00:59:55,718
Wouldn't it be great if my heart could
be a bit stronger, right dad?
