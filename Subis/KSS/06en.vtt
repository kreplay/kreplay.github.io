<i>Episode 6:
Calories of kisses, calories of love</i>

2
8
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:33,762
You've gotten pretty.

3
12
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:36,785
You're getting engaged tomorrow,
can you still be here?

4
17
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:38,266
Why don't you take my calls?

5
21
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:41,161
Chae Ri will kill me if she finds out.

6
25
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,644
Sorry.
 For making you bake our engagement party cake.

7
30
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:47,459
Don't be. I'll make sure
I spit on the cake.

8
35
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,841
I'm fine.
 Just make sure other people don't find out.

9
40
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:54,384
The rumors about your president is strange.

10
44
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:56,775
You still like checking on others?

11
48
00:01:56,775 --> 00:01:58,593
He looks at women as he looks at trash.

12
52
00:01:58,593 --> 00:01:59,970
Has a bad temper too.

13
56
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,775
That's better than being a player.

14
60
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:03,944
There are even rumors that 
he's not able to do what a "man" is suppose to do.

15
65
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:06,831
Don't you worry. He's
fine in that department.

16
70
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:10,105
You've slept with him already?

17
74
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:13,194
Yes.

18
78
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:19,946
Then we're even.

19
82
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:21,304
That's good.

20
86
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:22,498
What's good about it?

21
90
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:24,326
Break off with your boss.

22
94
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:28,778
-What?
-You... are my woman.

23
99
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:31,233
Break up.

24
103
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:34,783
You haven't come to your senses, huh?

25
107
00:02:34,783 --> 00:02:37,384
I'm your woman?
Your woman?!

26
112
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:41,613
Am I your toy?  Huh?
Am I your toy?

27
117
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:44,847
Do you want a beating, huh?

28
121
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:48,064
Sam Soon! It hurts!

29
125
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:51,256
-It hurts! 
-It should hurt!

30
130
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:59,350
Let go!

31
134
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:04,292
Why are you carrying an umbrella 
when it's not even raining?

32
139
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:05,983
I brought it 'cause I knew this would happen.
  Why?

33
144
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:08,694
-Let go!  Aren't you going to let go?
-Look me in the eyes.

34
149
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:11,231
Don't you have any feelings left for me?

35
153
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,432
Are you shooting a movie?

36
157
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:17,487
Look carefully.  
 You still love me, right?

37
162
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,487
Keep dreaming.

38
166
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:21,899
Do you think you're Shin Jong Yi?
(actor of controversial Korean sexual movie)

39
171
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:29,028
<i>It's not love.</i>

40
175
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:34,797
Nor is there any longing.

41
179
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,232
It's...

42
183
00:03:37,232 --> 00:03:40,151
Yes.

43
187
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:43,147
The guy whom I was with for 3 years.

44
191
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:46,580
It's impossible to forget completely.

45
195
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,663
I feel sad over the time that I wasted

46
199
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,942
Bitter...

47
203
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,184
and pitiful.

48
207
00:03:57,128 --> 00:04:01,506
I don't miss it, and I don't want to go back.

49
211
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:05,400
That's all it takes.

50
215
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,806
It's enough to start over again.

51
219
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:11,839
What about Chae Ri?

52
223
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,834
You're getting engaged tomorrow.

53
227
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:16,380
I'm going to do it ... the engagement.

54
231
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,166
What?

55
235
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:24,134
Chae Ri ... is cute and lovable.
And you're comfortable.

56
240
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,146
So?

57
244
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:29,553
You'll marry Chae Ri,

58
248
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:31,360
and have an affair with me?

59
252
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,358
What affair? It's love.

60
256
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:36,615
I'm confident we won't be caught.

61
260
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:37,972
You're crazy.

62
264
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:40,721
Yes, I am crazy.

63
268
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:44,067
When I saw you with him the other day,
do you realize how hurt I was?

64
273
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,895
My blood was boiling!

65
277
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:49,705
I wanted to wring his neck off right there and then.

66
281
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:51,875
That's when I realized...

67
285
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,551
That I still love you.

68
289
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:55,893
Don't use that word in vein.

69
293
00:04:55,893 --> 00:04:58,751
It's not love, but arrogance.

70
297
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,495
Whatever it is...

71
301
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:03,143
I only have one thought.

72
305
00:05:03,143 --> 00:05:05,961
That I want to start again with you.

73
309
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,740
You do this one more time.

74
313
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,391
I'll talk to Chae Ri about it.

75
317
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:18,031
I won't give up.

76
321
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:21,494
I'll make you my girl again...I will!

77
325
00:05:22,768 --> 00:05:26,838
I was going to let this go quietly,
 but you are provoking me.

78
330
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:31,146
Fine, we'll see about it tomorrow.

79
334
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:01,299
<i>Hello.</i>

80
338
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:02,471
Congratulations.

81
342
00:06:02,471 --> 00:06:05,283
You must have worked hard, putting this together.

82
346
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:09,101
-Thank you for your efforts.
-This way, please.

83
351
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,749
Hey Hairy, it's raining!

84
355
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:39,782
It's raining, hurry up.

85
359
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:42,520
Over here, hurry up.

86
363
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,521
Welcome.

87
367
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,110
Starting now,

88
371
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,368
Son of Min Jung Gek, Min Hyun Woo,

89
375
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:07,162
and daughter of Jang Young Chek Jae Chae Ri's 
engagement ceremony will begin.

90
380
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:11,778
Please put your hands together to welcome the couple.

91
384
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:15,043
Bride and groom to be ... enter!

92
388
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:31,000
♫ <i>More words. Words always the same words.</i> ♫

93
392
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,360
♫ <i>I don't know what to say.</i>♫

94
396
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,940
♫<i>Nothing but words. </i>♫

95
400
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,760
♫<i>The history of our love which I will never stop reading.</i>♫

96
404
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,400
♫ <i> Some easy words. Some fragile words. </i> ♫

97
408
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:41,970
<i>Wait a moment</i>

98
412
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,400
<i>Where are you going?</i>

99
416
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,410
♫ <i>You are yesterday and tomorrow.</i> ♫

<i>Ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention please. 
This young man has something to say.</i>

105
441
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
<i>This pretty girl is my girlfriend.</i>

106
445

♫ <i>Caramels, Bonbons and chocolates</i> ♫

107
449
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:17,626
<i>And we are sharing our first kiss tonight.</i>

108

111
465
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,520
♫ <i>Were placed upon my mouth but never my heart.</i>♫

112
469
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,650
♫ <i>A word again.</i>♫

113
473
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:41,380
<i>What did you just say?
My French isn't that good yet</i>

114
478
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,340
♫ <i>Words. Words. Words.</i>♫

115
482
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:58,716
<i>One cup of coffee, 5 kilo-calories.</i>

116
486
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:01,609
<i>Equivalent to 5 minutes of kissing.</i>

117
490
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:09,674
<i>What is the total calories of all the
kisses we shared over 3 years?</i>

118
495
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:13,436
<i>And the calories of love?</i>

119
499
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:17,205
<i>Where did that energy go?</i>

120
503
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:20,625
<i>Where to?</i>

121
507
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,699
Are you okay?

122
511
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,379
Miss Kim Sam Soon,

123
515
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:45,717
I asked if you're okay.

124
519
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:49,620
About what?

125
523
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,471
The cake looks good.

126
527
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:20,700
Now, the cake cutting ceremony will start.

127
531
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,224
We wish the couple happiness as they cut the cake together.

128
535
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:29,584
Will the bride and groom to be, 
please step forward?

129
540
00:12:48,337 --> 00:12:49,602
How much is it?

130
544
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,067
We just got started.

131
548
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,732
What about the sign board?

132
552
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,030
Why are you using someone else's daughter's name?

133
556
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,918
It's been there for 20 years.
We can't take it down just like that.

134
561
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:00,693
I should charge licensing fees.

135
565
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:03,533
You sold your mill to me, and you're asking fees for the signboard?

136
569
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,234
That's so funny.

137
573
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:07,940
It seems like she's unable to get married
because of this sign.

138
578
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,741
What excuse is that?

139
582
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:11,183
So how was the jalapeno?

140
586
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:12,708
Was it spicy enough?

141
590
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,835
Jalapeno?

142
594
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:17,803
Sam Soon bought them last night, two kilograms of it.

143
598
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:19,514
Sam Soon...did what?

144
602
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:20,990
You didn't make kimchi?

145
606
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,056
She asked for the spiciest ones.

146
610
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:48,728
How is Sam Soon's spiciness?

147
614
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:52,538
I warned you not to provoke me.

148
618
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:55,139
You deserve it.

149
622
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,584
Unni ... Unni?

150
626
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:02,228
The bride's mom wants to speak with you.

151
630
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:07,321
Me? Why?

152
634
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:35,767
Your dad made such delicious rice cakes,

153
638
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:38,529
you must take after your dad.

154
642
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:41,991
I've never had such beautiful and 
delicious cake!

155
647
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:44,958
You've worked hard.
Here's spending money.

156
652
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,586
I can't take this, Aunt.

157
656
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,008
-Take it
-I can't

158
661
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,550
I used to give it to you when you were little.

159
665
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,051
-Take it, Unniw.

160
669
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:57,114
Sam Soon, you should get married soon too.

161
673
00:14:57,114 --> 00:14:59,574
Sam Soon, thank you for today.

162
677
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:05,157
Thank you Unnie.
 The cake was really delicious.

163
682
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:09,051
I'm going to reserve our wedding cake.
Is that okay?

164
687
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:10,187
All right

165
691
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:14,056
I'll buy you lunch next time. Thanks, Unnie!

166
695
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:22,652
Sam Soon.

167
699
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:26,962
Aren't you wasting your talents here?

168
703
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,247
It's none of your business.

169
707
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,497
Shall I open a bakery for you?

170
711
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:36,875
You're already acting like a rich, married man?

171
715
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,436
Was that too much?

172
719
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:40,673
Isn't there anything you want?

173
723
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Do you know car bumpers have expressions, too?

174
727
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:50,780
When a new driver wants to get in,

175
731
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,987
how much the blinkers feel shy.

176
735
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:58,042
How the driver is covered in cold sweat.
It's all visible.

177
740
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,393
A reckless driver has reckless blinkers.

178
744
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:05,536
Their bumper reads, "Don't mess with me."

179
748
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:09,768
Even metals behave that way. What about people?

180
752
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,813
Don't ruin the memories.

181
756
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:15,546
Be cool,

182
760
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:17,639
and leave in style.

183
764
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:21,918
So your back looks beautiful.

184
768
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,217
The engagement party was excellent.

185
772
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:45,040
What's a guy who just got engaged doing?

186
776
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:49,012
You two aren't compatible, so
I  gave her some advice.

187
781
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:50,208
You worry too much.

188
785
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,218
Cause it concerns Sam Soon.

189
789
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,420
Use those worries on Chae Ri.

190
793
00:16:54,434 --> 00:16:57,018
At this rate, you're going to punch me.

191
797
00:16:59,613 --> 00:17:03,060
Bother her again then I'll punch you.

192
801
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:06,982
I thought you were gentle but 
you seem pretty tough.

193
806
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,584
I better run away before I get beat up.

194
810
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:20,926
The reasons why we can't meet good guys:

195
814
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:23,888
1. Kind men are ugly.

196
818
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:27,251
2. Handsome guys are not kind.

197
822
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:31,741
3.  Handsome and kind guys are already married.

198
826
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:32,820
That's where we stopped.

199
830
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,821
Number 4.

200
834
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:38,177
Handsome, kind, and single guys are poor.

201
838
00:18:38,177 --> 00:18:39,278
Number 5.

202
842
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:42,422
Handsome, kind, single, and rich guys ...

203
846
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,915
aren't interested in us.

204
850
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:45,916
Number 6.

205
854
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:50,586
Guys who are handsome, kind, single,
 rich, and have interest in us  ...

206
859
00:18:50,586 --> 00:18:52,492
are players.

207
863
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:53,793
Number 7.

208
867
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:56,519
Handsome, kind, single, rich,

209
871
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:00,961
have interest in us, and aren't players ...

210
875
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:03,189
are homosexuals!

211
879
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:06,025
Number 8... wait a sec,
I need to go to the washroom.

212
884
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:07,884
Ma'am, where's the washroom?

213
888
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:09,384
Over there.

214
892
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,995
What is this?
It sounds awful.

215
897
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,387
You sound even worse.

216
901
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,711
Never had piano lessons when you were little?

217
905
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,794
That's the fate being the third daughter.

218
909
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:18,096
Trailing behind my sisters.

219
913
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:19,970
Move over.

220
917
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,282
Watch my hands and follow.

221
921
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:32,885
Why aren't you playing?

222
925
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:35,858
It's a special bonus in return 
for the cake you made today.

223
930
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,020
Are you playing with your feet?

224
934
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,290
Have you seen such long toes?

225
938
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:55,830
Even hands are ugly.

226
942
00:20:56,906 --> 00:21:01,891
For 10 years, try kneading the flour,
 and touch the ovens, and see if your hands last.

227
947
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:05,149
Do better this time.

228
951
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:06,964
1,  2,  3...

229
955
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:31,700
So that's how you play it.

230
959
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,178
I'll play the chords, and you do the melody, get it?

231
963
00:21:57,639 --> 00:21:59,265
Done!

232
967
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,690
Why did you cry?

233
971
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:09,347
Do you still like Min Hyun Woo?

234
975
00:22:09,347 --> 00:22:10,747
No.

235
979
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:14,528
Then why did you cry?

236
983
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,730
Do I have to answer that?

237
987
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:22,570
No... not really

238
991
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:26,745
Cause I was upset.

239
995
00:22:29,353 --> 00:22:32,338
People change.  Hearts change.

240
999
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:34,662
And the love changes too.

241
1003
00:22:36,738 --> 00:22:43,180
To think that he everlasting love that I dreamt about
doesn't exist ...

242
1008
00:22:44,103 --> 00:22:46,407
it made me feel upset.

243
1012
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,300
Did you just figure that out?

244
1016
00:22:50,926 --> 00:22:53,103
Like you know everything.

245
1020
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:57,529
I'm deducting that from your paycheck.

246
1024
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,600
Well ... Unless you share it with me.

247
1028
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:10,683
Jeez.  You have a weird way of asking for a drink.

248
1032
00:23:13,598 --> 00:23:17,317
There isn't any good liquor left, 
only stuff used for cooking.

249
1037
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,280
Basketball...

250
1041
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:22,179
I started basketball because I didn't want to stay
 at home with my grandfather,

251
1046
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:26,940
once my grandfather passed away,
I didn't want to play anymore.

252
1051
00:25:28,018 --> 00:25:29,846
And what else?

253
1055
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:31,653
Ah, my name?

254
1059
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:35,100
Why do I want to call myself, Hee Jin?

255
1063
00:25:35,974 --> 00:25:38,036
I have two elder sisters.

256
1067
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,759
Both of them went to a piano academy.

257
1071
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:43,540
I could only tag along and watch.

258
1075
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:48,131
My family is actually not that well-off.

259
1079
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:51,316
They couldn't afford to
send me for piano lessons.

260
1084
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,818
But one day,

261
1088
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:56,687
the piano teacher asked me over.

262
1092
00:25:56,687 --> 00:26:01,566
You know the chopstick song ... 
She taught that song to me.

263
1097
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:03,893
It's that song we played a while ago.

264
1101
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,273
She saw me tagging along after my sisters,

265
1105
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:12,783
she must have felt sorry for me.

266
1109
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:14,240
Anyway,

267
1113
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,766
that piano teacher's name was, Hee Jin.

268
1117
00:26:19,766 --> 00:26:22,248
Kang Hee Jin.

269
1121
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:27,878
She wore mini-skirts with boots.

270
1125
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,677
She looked really pretty.

271
1129
00:26:32,306 --> 00:26:33,708
So...

272
1133
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
So is that why it's Kim Hee Jin?

273
1137
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,300
Yeah.

274
1141
00:26:37,303 --> 00:26:39,202
And I thought...

275
1145
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,408
Don't laugh.

276
1149
00:26:42,408 --> 00:26:46,414
Because she was my ideal type ... my teacher.

277
1153
00:26:55,253 --> 00:26:57,642
And now number 10!

278
1157
00:26:57,642 --> 00:27:00,117
What will it be?

279
1161
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:05,174
Handsome, kind, single, rich, is interested in us,

280
1165
00:27:05,174 --> 00:27:07,232
not a player, and not a homosexual.

281
1169
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:10,269
We approach a guy like that yet 
he still doesn't lose interest ...

282
1174
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:12,450
That person is ...

283
1178
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:15,446
Has a problem.

284
1182
00:27:15,446 --> 00:27:18,080
There's got to be some problem somewhere!

285
1186
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,393
That is reality.

286
1190
00:27:20,393 --> 00:27:24,495
So how did Sam Soon seduce our Prince Jin Hyun?
That's the question.

287
1195
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:26,768
Is she younger than me?

288
1199
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:28,209
Does she have a better figure than me?

289
1203
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:29,488
Is she prettier than me?

290
1207
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:30,909
Does she have a better personality than me?

291
1211
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:32,857
Right will prevail in the end.

292
1215
00:27:32,857 --> 00:27:34,970
You saw that girl, right?

293
1219
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Now, Sam Soon will be in a pitiful position.

294
1223
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:49,565
I'm not hoping for something too grand.

295
1227
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:52,444
I can start with an area of about 180 square ft.

296
1231
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:56,207
I need about 3 to 4 tables.

297
1235
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,660
When people think about the most delicious cake,

298
1239
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,840
Ah, there!

299
1243
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:05,569
I want to set up a bakery like that.

300
1247
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:08,511
The cookies that I want to make,

301
1251
00:28:08,511 --> 00:28:11,014
the cakes that I imagine.

302
1255
00:28:11,014 --> 00:28:13,474
I'll make them as I wish.

303
1259
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:17,867
If they sell well, it'll be great.

304
1263
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:22,710
If they don't, I'll just eat them all.

305
1267
00:28:23,998 --> 00:28:26,094
At least you won't starve to death.

306
1271
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:27,660
Bingo!

307
1275
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:32,999
What's there to life?
We all live like that then die.

308
1280
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:35,601
You didn't live that long, being 30.

309
1284
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:38,588
How would you know what life is?

310
1288
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:42,525
I...

311
1292
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:47,544
In order to raise money for my
plane ticket to Paris and tuition fees,

312
1297
00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:50,340
there isn't a part time job, I haven't tried.

313
1301
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:52,815
Do you know why?

314
1305
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,978
I didn't want to live like my dad.

315
1309
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,926
He said life was nothing.

316
1313
00:29:02,926 --> 00:29:07,250
That's what my dad was always saying.

317
1317
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,789
My dad lived like that for 50 years of his life.

318
1321
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:14,890
As people called him President Kim of the mill.

319
1325
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,465
But there are times...

320
1329
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:25,064
Once in awhile,
I want a life where I'm noticed.

321
1334
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:33,398
At least at this restaurant, you are special.

322
1338
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,000
Oh my, is that a compliment?

323
1342
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,413
You're the oldest amongst the female staff.

324
1346
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:46,522
And the heaviest person.

325
1350
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:53,005
Why do you ... always ... twist your words?

326
1354
00:29:53,005 --> 00:29:55,446
Why do you keep twisting it?

327
1358
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:57,955
You're weird, really weird.

328
1362
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:34,744
It's your turn to answer questions.

329
1366
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,026
About Yoo Hee Jin...

330
1370
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:47,112
What got you so mad?

331
1374
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:55,677
I answered all your questions, 
but you don't even answer mine.

332
1379
00:30:55,677 --> 00:30:58,147
You're petty.

333
1383
00:31:02,015 --> 00:31:04,106
It's all over.

334
1387
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,551
It's all over, so don't ask any more.

335
1391
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:26,248
You know this song?

336
1395
00:31:26,248 --> 00:31:28,061
I can't know it?

337
1399
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:31,026
This song is REALLY old.

338
1403
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:33,676
Cause it's a REALLY good song.

339
1407
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:39,177
Do you know who wrote this song?

340
1411
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:41,030
I have no idea.

341
1415
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,925
Herman Hesse.

342
1419
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,555
Is that right?

343
1423
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:51,376
Written by Herman Hesse, and music by Seo Yoo Seok.

Sorry, my singing wasn't as good as your playing.

355
1472
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:44,279
-You sing pretty well.
-Wha...t?

356
1477
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:49,405
What is it this time? An insult or a compliment?

357
1481
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:51,101
Compliment.

358
1485
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:52,960
Then why are you laughing?

359
1489
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:57,732
You're mocking me, right?

360
1493
00:33:57,732 --> 00:33:58,791
No.

361
1497
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,858
You are mocking me!

362
1501
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:03,416
No, I'm not.

363
1505
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:08,234
It's raining and you're laughing,
so it's rain laughing (korean pun).

364
1510
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:13,319
Why do you keep laughing?

365
1514
00:34:16,294 --> 00:34:18,497
You've got cream on your lips.

366
1518
00:34:18,497 --> 00:34:19,897
Where?

367
1522
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,915
Here?

368
1526
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:54,616
Oh, you know ...

369
1530
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:55,893
That...

370
1534
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:59,016
That Seo Yoo Seok.

371
1538
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:08,795
He used to be a professional handball player 
during his younger days

372
1543
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:10,137
Okay.

373
1547
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:19,660
He was on the national team.

374
1551
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:22,312
And...

375
1555
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:29,048
Isn't that unique?

376
1559
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,810
Yes.

377
1563
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:43,120
Shall we leave?

378
1567
00:35:44,037 --> 00:35:45,648
Okay.

379
1571
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,787
Why aren't you closing your eyes today?

380
1575
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:10,544
Change into clean water and wipe again.

381
1579
00:39:10,544 --> 00:39:13,224
Can't you hold it more tightly?

382
1583
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:14,656
This is really...

383
1587
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:26,717
Pour it over here.

384
1591
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:30,943
You...

385
1595
00:39:46,892 --> 00:39:49,737
I'm going crazy, crazy ...

386
1599
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,590
What is it

387
1603
00:39:53,473 --> 00:39:55,880
Nothing.

388
1607
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,269
But Unnie ...

389
1611
00:39:58,269 --> 00:39:59,782
That...

390
1615
00:39:59,782 --> 00:40:01,904
With the President ...

391
1619
00:40:01,904 --> 00:40:04,792
have you kissed ... him yet?

392
1623
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:07,164
You saw it?

393
1627
00:40:07,164 --> 00:40:08,994
Saw what?

394
1631
00:40:10,913 --> 00:40:12,750
Nothing.

395
1635
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:18,753
You did it already!

396
1639
00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:21,162
Go!  Go and clean.

397
1643
00:40:21,162 --> 00:40:24,460
Unnie.  How do you feel when you kiss?

398
1647
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,102
You've never been kissed?

399
1651
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,820
You're totally repressed.

400
1655
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:37,468
How does it feels like?

401
1659
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:44,625
It's a bit ... yummy.

402
1663
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,440
It's yummy?

403
1667
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:52,396
Shall we try it?

404
1671
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:09,121
It's my turn to clean the office.

405
1675
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:10,798
I'll do it myself later.

406
1679
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:12,607
No.

407
1683
00:41:12,607 --> 00:41:14,577
I'll do it.

408
1687
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,840
It's hot.

409
1691
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,377
I heard the temperature is the highest in a century.

410
1695
00:41:31,377 --> 00:41:34,240
It's really hot.

411
1699
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,906
Yeah.

412
1703
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:51,681
Why ... why are you doing this, Captain Jang?

413
1707
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,223
How is it?

414
1711
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:55,941
Am I better than Sam Soon?

415
1715

The orphanage, I think.

427
1763
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,940

473
1953
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:21,700
Did you perhaps put something in the cake?

474
1957
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,867
What?

475
1961
00:47:22,867 --> 00:47:25,726
I'm saying, did you put anything weird 
in the cake we ate the other day?

476
1966
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:26,778
What do you mean, weird?

477
1970
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:29,757
Things that makes one irrational?

478
1974
00:47:29,757 --> 00:47:34,009
I don't fool around with food, so don't insult my cakes.

479
1978
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:36,610
It's been over few days.
Why didn't you come to get your bag back?

480
1983
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,567
Then why didn't you return it to me?

481
1987
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:39,739
I thought you'd come looking for it.

482
1991
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:41,763
I thought you'd return it to me.

483
1995
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,166
About what happened that day...

484
1999
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:49,140
I'd like to apologize.

485
2003
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,892
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

486
2007
00:47:54,228 --> 00:47:57,046
I should be the one apologizing.

487
2011
00:47:57,046 --> 00:48:01,561
Cause I was the one...who did it first.

488
2015
00:48:04,704 --> 00:48:08,705
Regardless whose fault this is, it's fortunate.
Since we share the same thoughts.

489
2020
00:48:08,705 --> 00:48:10,079
Yes.  It really is fortunate.

490
2024
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,862
This won't happen again.

491
2028
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:13,444
Of course.  It shouldn't happen.

492
2032
00:48:13,444 --> 00:48:15,410
-You can leave now.
-Yes

493
2037
00:48:16,512 --> 00:48:18,865
By any chance, are you starting to like me?

494
2041
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:25,458
What did you just say?

495
2045
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:27,859
I asked if you liked me.

496
2049
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,684
Well.  Your illness isn't healed yet?

497
2053
00:48:31,684 --> 00:48:34,491
I'll say it again but,
in our contract, Clause 6.

498
2058
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:36,907
We'll pretend to date, but we won't date for real.

499
2062
00:48:36,907 --> 00:48:38,788
Never.

500
2066
00:48:41,095 --> 00:48:44,165
I'm curious about something too.

501
2070
00:48:44,165 --> 00:48:46,556
When I came in the next day, 
there were not traces of drinking.

502
2075
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,442
Were you the one who cleared it?

503
2079
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:50,131
Yes.

504
2083
00:48:50,131 --> 00:48:52,739
With what sense?

505
2087
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:53,640
What?

506
2091
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,557
Didn't you say lost your rationality? 
With what sense did you clean up?

507
2096
00:48:56,557 --> 00:48:59,340
And how did you pack my bag?

508
2100
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:03,813
I did lose it, but there's still 1% left.

509
2104
00:49:03,813 --> 00:49:05,434
Oh, I see.

510
2108
00:49:05,434 --> 00:49:07,576
That's true. It's not like you're on drugs,

511
2112
00:49:07,576 --> 00:49:10,835
to jump on a heavy old maid, 
you should at least loose that much.

512
2117
00:49:10,835 --> 00:49:14,000
If you lost all 100%, 
you'd have been in real trouble.

513
2122
00:49:15,755 --> 00:49:19,661
Anyway, I'll apologize again. It won't happen again.

514
2126
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:23,106
No, I gave you the opportunity. It's my mistake.

515
2130
00:49:23,106 --> 00:49:25,429
No, it's my fault for drinking too much.

516
2134
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,651
No.

517
2138
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:29,970
Knowing you have bad drinking habits,
it's my fault for leaving you to drink too much.

518
2143
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,171
No.

519
2147
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:34,520
It's my fault for sitting next to a wolf
 on a rainy day.

520
2152
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:40,269
Attracting a wolf on a rainy day... are you a fox?

521
2156
00:49:42,142 --> 00:49:45,551
A fox doesn't go round attracting just any wolf.

522
2160
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:47,834
The same with wolves.

523
2164
00:49:47,834 --> 00:49:50,052
Telling me to sit next to you so you could teach me
 how to play the piano.  Isn't that an act of a wolf?

524
2169
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:53,182
A woman having drinks alone, 
is also an act of a fox.

525
2174
00:49:53,182 --> 00:49:54,879
I thought everyone left!

526
2178
00:49:54,879 --> 00:49:56,911
Next time, don't drink alone.

527
2182
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,892
It looks like, 
"Come over and seduce me."

528
2187
00:49:59,892 --> 00:50:01,768
That's what guys think.

529
2191
00:50:01,768 --> 00:50:04,447
There are times when girls want to have a drink alone.

530
2195
00:50:04,447 --> 00:50:06,129
Then go home and drink.

531
2199
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:07,330
Hey!

532
2203
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:11,615
At my age, I can't even drink as I wish?!

533
2207
00:50:11,615 --> 00:50:13,483
Should I be informal too?

534
2211
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:18,901
Get your things ready tomorrow. We're going to Jeju Island.

535
2215
00:50:18,901 --> 00:50:22,409
It's a family thing, 
so we have to pretend we're dating.

536
2220
00:50:43,171 --> 00:50:45,004
You can stay at my place you know.

537
2224
00:50:45,036 --> 00:50:46,673
Aren't you uncomfortable?

538
2228
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,014
No.  I'm fine. I'm okay.

539
2232
00:50:49,017 --> 00:50:52,458
I like it here.  I'm meeting lots of wonderful people.

540
2236
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:57,384
But still... Feel free to come anytime. 
 I have lots of rooms to spare.

541
2241
00:50:57,902 --> 00:51:00,559
You know I would come 
if you had just one room.

542
2246
00:51:01,523 --> 00:51:05,552
But since you have so many, 
I'm gonna pass.  Sorry.

543
2251
00:51:08,212 --> 00:51:12,551
I hope she'll like it, but 
usually children wear something like this.

544
2256
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:16,268
What is that in Korean? How do you say?

545
2260
00:51:16,292 --> 00:51:18,300
Saekdong jogori.

00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,616
Sae ddong?

547
2269
00:51:19,616 --> 00:51:23,131
You've got to pronounce it properly.
 Otherwise, it's going to sound like 'bird poop'.

548
2274
00:51:23,141 --> 00:51:25,005
So...saekdong.

549
2278
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,410
Saekdong.

550

--Jogori.

00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,646
- Good. 
 - Good?
-Yeah.

553
2298
00:51:32,675 --> 00:51:35,104
I am Korean.

554
2302
00:51:35,104 --> 00:51:37,258
I don't know.  Maybe I should exchange it.

555
2306
00:51:37,258 --> 00:51:39,143
What's your mom's favorite color?

556
2310
00:51:39,143 --> 00:51:40,540
Are you serious?

557
2314
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,869
What?
 You think that a color doesn't matter to a woman?

558
2319
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:47,299
I think that color matters to a woman 
that could see the color.

559
2324
00:51:48,594 --> 00:51:51,551
Hee Jin, I've told you like a thousand times
that my mom is blind.

560
2329
00:51:51,551 --> 00:51:53,801
-Maybe two thousand times.
-Ah ...

561
2334
00:52:03,876 --> 00:52:05,742
But you know what?

562
2338
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,033
It doesn't matter because ...
you know, it doesn't change her.

563
2343
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:14,048
She doesn't remember whether 
she was blind when she was born or...

564
2348
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:17,527
after she was born.  
It doesn't ... doesn't matter.

565
2353
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:22,315
So, what did your mom say when she heard that you were coming to Korea.

566
2357
00:52:22,343 --> 00:52:24,351
She said...

567
2361
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:27,021
She said, "Henry!"

568
2365
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:30,226
"I don't want you looking at any of those Korean girls."

569
2369
00:52:30,226 --> 00:52:30,925
Why not?

570
2373
00:52:30,925 --> 00:52:34,340
She said because if they see me they would fall over.

571
2377
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:37,663
Mesmerized by my gorgeous looks.

572
2381
00:52:37,663 --> 00:52:39,194
- You see?
 - I've fallen.

573
2386
00:52:39,194 --> 00:52:42,005
You see the affect I have? 
 I even do it to myself.

574
2391
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,563
Don't look at me like that.  
You know you're gorgeous.

575
2396
00:52:58,956 --> 00:53:00,967
But you know what's really annoying?

576
2400
00:53:08,475 --> 00:53:13,216
Neohantehnum gasumi an dugeungeora. 
<i>My heart doesn't race when I'm with you.</i>

577
2405
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:18,796
Okay, that sounded really bad.
What does that mean?

578
2410
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,558
You know... I just....

579
2414
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:23,860
I don't feel anything when I'm with you.

580
2418
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,283
That's great.

581
2422
00:53:37,335 --> 00:53:39,410
What?  You knew this all along.

582
2426
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:40,922
I did not know this all along.

583
2430
00:53:40,922 --> 00:53:42,591
Yes you did.

584
2434
00:53:42,591 --> 00:53:44,685
I'm hungry anyways.  Get me some food to eat.

585
2438
00:53:44,685 --> 00:53:46,018
You're hungry?  I'm hurt.

586
2442
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:48,312
I know.  
You can be in pain after you get me something to eat.

587
2447
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,111
You see this?

588
2451
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:51,554
No, no, no.  Hurry and get up.

589
2455
00:53:51,554 --> 00:53:52,955
I'm hungry.

590
2459
00:53:52,955 --> 00:53:54,602
Dr Kim, I'm hungry.

591
2463
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:56,549
Dr. Kim... off duty.

592
2467
00:53:58,136 --> 00:53:59,455
Okay, all I have is toast.

593
2471
00:53:59,455 --> 00:54:00,623
Toast and milk is fine.

594
2475
00:54:00,623 --> 00:54:02,047
No.  All I have is toast.

595
2479
00:54:02,047 --> 00:54:04,103
Toast and milk.

596
2483
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:05,407
Toast.... and toast.

597
2487
00:54:05,407 --> 00:54:07,169
Bring it!

598
2491
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:11,895
- What's up man?
 - Hey, how you doing?

599
2496
00:54:12,008 --> 00:54:14,412
- Hey bro.  Hello.  
 - You want some beer?

600
2501
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:16,042
No, I'm okay.  Thank you.

601
2505
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:18,975
Is that your girlfriend?

602
2509
00:54:18,975 --> 00:54:21,927
No. No. 
 That's ... that is just a friend.

603
2514
00:54:21,927 --> 00:54:24,440
Wow, she is really, really gorgeous.

<i>Jeju Seoul Hotel Grand Opening
June 22, 2005</i>

605
2523
00:54:42,554 --> 00:54:46,009
You know what?  I think we should stay here.

606
2527
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:01,460
At this Seoul Hotel, 
our intention is to have just one guest,

607
2532
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:05,007
creating hundred of guests,

608
2536
00:55:05,007 --> 00:55:10,691
with the service of a 21st century.

609
2540
00:55:14,035 --> 00:55:19,196
Why is this so boring?
Does this even make sense?

610
2545
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:23,247
It's hard to get a guest to return again.

611
2549
00:55:24,378 --> 00:55:27,375
Frankly, our hotel rates are way too expensive.

612
2553
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,884
For me,
they let me sleep here for free.

613
2558
00:55:29,884 --> 00:55:33,279
But if they want me to pay for all of it,
I'd never come here.

614
2563
00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:38,035
Then would I waste hundreds of dollars,
to sleep for one night?

2568
00:55:39,657 --> 00:55:42,790
<i>I said this to someone and they told me.</i>

616
2572
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:45,159
<i>"It's because Chairman is a scrooge."</i>

617
2576
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:52,164
<i>"But wouldn't it be okay if I build a hotel
that would be worth hundreds of dollars a night.</i>

618
2581
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:58,584
<i>I thought that was a great idea.</i>

619
2585
00:56:00,452 --> 00:56:02,776
<i>I think my speech is getting longer ...</i>

620
2589
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:07,651
The conclusion is, our hotel is a great hotel.

621
2593
00:56:07,651 --> 00:56:11,421
What does everyone think?
Does our hotel look great?

622
2598
00:56:21,469 --> 00:56:24,618
After the party, we're going to rest a bit
and go back on the afternoon flight.

623
2603
00:56:24,618 --> 00:56:26,568
I can't be around watching out for you.

624
2607
00:56:26,568 --> 00:56:29,092
A "motel business?"

625
2611
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:32,960
-Is this a motel?  It's a hotel.
-What's the difference?

626
2616
00:56:33,796 --> 00:56:35,744
Have you seen such a huge motel?

627
2620
00:56:35,744 --> 00:56:37,613
You sleep at both places.

628
2624
00:56:37,613 --> 00:56:42,295
Motels are for sleeping, but you can dine,
exercise, and hold business meetings in a hotel.

629
2629
00:56:46,343 --> 00:56:50,285
You show off in so many various ways.

630
2633
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:52,814
Jin Hyun oppa!

631
2637
00:56:52,814 --> 00:56:54,595
We are late.

632
2641
00:56:54,595 --> 00:56:56,374
Why are you here?

633
2645
00:56:56,374 --> 00:57:01,800
I told you last time!
 My fiance's company constructed this hotel.

634
2650
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,872
I'm still trying to learn all I can from Dad and you.

635
2654
00:57:06,687 --> 00:57:09,728
Sam Soon untie!
Are you going to act like you don't know me?

636
2659
00:57:12,335 --> 00:57:14,281
Hello.
