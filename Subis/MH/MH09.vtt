00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.240
Even if I rescue you from danger, you don't remember it at all.

3
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.150
<i>I... like you a lot.</i>

4
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.930
<i>No... I love you.</i>

5
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.030
<i>- You know, I... 
 - I like you, Pil.</i>

6
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.430
We have confirmed each other's feelings many times,

7
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.010
but both my confession and your confession

8
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.180
become something that have never happened.

9
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.350
That's because every time I go into the manhole and travel in time, the past and present reset themselves.

10
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.470
<i>You know the camera that you lost the day before I left for the military...</i>

11
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.590
<i>I heard that pharmacist guy found it for you.</i>

12
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.390
<i>- Are you perhaps the owner of this camera? 
 - So?</i>

13
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.470
<i>I'm thinking that you saw that video message I left you on there if you got the camera back.</i>

14
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.030
<i>I never saw a video message like that.</i>

15
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.990
<i>Jae Hyeon...</i>

16
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.080
Ironically, because of the things I've done in the past,

17
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.330
you are becoming closer and closer to Jae Hyeon.

18
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.440
<i>It wasn't a prank. I meant it.</i>

19
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.950
Rather, the uncomfortable truths don't reset themselves.

20
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.440
<i>What?</i>

21
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.990
<i>I did that because I like you.</i>

22
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.570
It's true that Jin Sook likes me, after all.

23
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.660
Soo Jin, what should I do now?

24
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.050
How can I  get you back?

25

<i>[Episode 9]</i>

26
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.520
What?

27
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.180
What the heck is this?

28
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.200
Where is this place?

29
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.350
Oh...

30
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.460
What's going on here? Am I trapped?

31
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.410
Hey! Hey, manhole!

32
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.080
Hey, you should open up the lid of this!

33
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.930
Hey!

34
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.750
Huh?

35
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.050
What's that about?

36
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.290
Wow.

37
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.400
My bride looks so beautiful today.

38
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.580
W-What did you say?

39
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.030
The wedding is happening right now?

40
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.870
Hey, hey. No. It can't.

41
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.000
No, Soo Jin!

42
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.090
Hey! Hey, Soo Jin!

43
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.730
Soo Jin, you can't marry him!

44
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.220
No, you can't...

45
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.600
No! This marriage is invalid.

46
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.670
This marriage is invalid!

47
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.060
You scared me.

48
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.350
Hey, be quiet.

49
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.520
Hey, Seok Tae.

50
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.540
What year is this?

51
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.490
Hey, I've known you all my life but I'm still having a hard time getting used to you.

52
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.720
What do you mean what year is this?! It's 2014.

53
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.390
20..14?!

54
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.160
2014...

55
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.780
If this is 2014, then it hasn't been long since I got discharged from the military.

56
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.230
Then why did I see Soo Jin's wedding all of a sudden?

57
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.950
So, does this mean that Soo Jin's wedding is still going on in the present?

58
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.800
Man, this is driving me crazy.

59
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.350
Hey, Seok Tae.

60
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.780
What's Soo Jin up to these days?

61
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.100
What do you mean what is she doing? She's working as an assistant at that photography studio.

62
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.870
Oh yeah, that's right.

63
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.580
Hey...

64
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.890
What are you doing there anyway?

65
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.530
By the way, what are you going to get for Jin Sook's birthday?

66
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.270
Jin Sook?

67
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.740
Jin Sook...

68
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.510
<i>Why are you taking my sincere feelings as a joke?</i>

69
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.550
<i>I'm being serious when I say that I like you. I've liked you ever since high school.</i>

70
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.760
There's no way you forgot about Jin Sook's birthday today, right?

71
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.450
Jin Sook, please don't.

72
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.920
What are you talking about? You're being like this because you don't have money again, huh?

73
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.990
A future civil servant who doesn't have any money. Jin Sook will understand that.

74
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.190
Your thought is what will count and that's plenty enough.

75
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.760
I have to somehow turn Jin Sook's feeling around no matter what.

76
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.300
That's what I have to do.

77
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.820
Seriously, how am I suppose to face Jin Sook like this?

78
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.880
<i>[To: Jin Sook ❤︎ Jin Sook, a very happy birthday to you ❤︎]</i>

80
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.210
So hot!

81
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.330
It's done.

82
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.560
Three years ago?

83
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.560
Why of all times does it have to be now?

84
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.970
It would've been nice if you just sent me back to high school while you're at it.

85
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.420
Then I could've come up with something to do about this.

86
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.830
What am I supposed to do and where am I supposed to start?

87
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.310
Hey, be careful with your steps. Careful now.

88
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.720
What's this fuss about?

89
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.100
Stop!

90
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.870
Ta-da!

91
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.900
Happy birthday, Sook.

92
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.190
Hey. When did you prepare all this?

93
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.580
Gosh, girl. Don't you have a photo shoot to go to today? You're not going to be late?

94
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.070
Look, my friend comes first before my work, okay?

95
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.230
Have I ever skipped making your birthday meal? Have a seat there.

96
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.930
I made all your favorite dishes including buIgogi (<i>marinated beef</i>)  and  japchae (<i>glass noodles</i>).

97
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.170
Kang Soo Jin, thank you so much.

98
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.280
My grandma always worried for me. She was afraid that I'd be celebrating my birthday all alone.

99
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.470
Please tell your grandma not to worry.

100
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.780
I will take care of your birthday meals for the rest of my life.

101
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.790
Let's cancel the "rest of my life" part.

102
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.470
I'm sure when I get a boyfriend, he'll do all this for me too.

103
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.920
Oh, is that right?

104
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.470
Then you should say that after you get yourself a boyfriend.

105
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.400
What's with that reaction, you old lady?

106
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.600
It would be so awesome if the heavens gave me a boyfriend as a birthday present.

107
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.830
You shouldn't look up to the sky for a boyfriend but you should look more closely around you instead.

108
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.560
I wonder if there is a nice guy out there for you?

109
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.530
Hey, eat first!

110
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.920
I will sing you the birthday son—

111
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.960
Thanks for the food.

112
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.930
Why is it that I never get to sing the birthday song each year?

113
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.290
Hey, Kang Soo Jin.

114
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.540
This is so delicious.

115
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.390
You should be a chef instead of a photographer.

116
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.990
Does it taste okay?

117
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:35.230
Alright, I'm going recruit  you to work for me at my shop. Let's write up a contract.

118
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.620
Stop it! You always talk about the same thing everyday.

119
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.680
Why not?! 
 <i> [Episode 9: Sometimes friendship hurts more than love]</i>

120
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.670
Oh, why not? It's so good though. Why, why, why?

121
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:45.990
I told you, I'm okay!

122
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.660
- Even though I made it, I have to say it does taste good.
- You're so shameless.

123
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.160
It tastes so great, so great!

124
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.720
How should I solve the misunderstanding with Soo Jin?

125
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.070
And how should I change Jin Sook's feelings?

126
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.350
<i>[Military mail]</i>

127
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.100
What should I do about this?

128
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.540
Should I just go over to Jin Sook and ask for it?

129
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.030
No, I shouldn't. Jin Sook might try to confess to me again.

130
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.160
What would I do then?

131
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.460
Oh, that's right. It's the past right now, huh?

132
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.040
Then the fact that Jin Sook took the letters could be reset.

133
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.630
Yeah, okay.

134
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.790
Pil!

135
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.630
Hello.

136
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.440
I haven't seen you in a while.

137
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.370
I guess it's because you've been studying, right?

138
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.890
Yes, it's time for me to grow up now.

139
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:52.920
That's a good idea. They say that when a person matures, they die—

140
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.760
Oh my, what am I talking about?

141
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.390
But why are you so awkward with Soo Jin?

142
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.850
- I thought that maybe you two had a fight. 
 - Pardon?

143
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.890
Ever since you came back from the military, Soo Jin's face would freeze up whenever anyone talked about you.

144
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.270
And I could sense that she hates you—

145
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.830
Oh my. What am I saying?

146
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.990
Anyway, be good friends with my Soo Jin. Come over sometime too.

147
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.410
I'll get going.

148
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.800
So Soo Jin is mad at me.

149
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.570
It must be because she didn't receive my reply letters.

150
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.460
First, let's find the letters. There's no other answer but that.

151
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.900
I'm going to take the picture!

152
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.480
Groom, bride, you don't look affectionate! These pictures will exist forever!

153
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.160
Here, I'm taking the picture! Get ready!

154
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.470
That's not it. Wedding pictures should show tenderness.

155
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.050
Put your hand on your bride's waist.

156
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.480
- Sunbae!
- Oh, you're here?

157
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.380
Sit down.

158
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:10.620
I am the happiest person in the world!

159
00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.690
Here! Next is kiss time!

160
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.710
Kiss or a peck?

161
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.330
A little more.

162
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.770
One, two!

163
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.680
Three! Oh my!

164
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.890
Hello.

165
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.660
Oh, hello. Wait a moment.

166
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.050
Groom and bride, let's take a break before we continue. Drink some water.

167
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.770
Thank you!

168
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.760
You are different than usual when you're working.

169
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.730
It's cool.

170
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.580
- I guess you're not working at the pharmacy today.
- Ah—

171
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.890
It's Jae Hyeon's off day today, so I asked him to come along.

172
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.130
I did so he can have some fresh air.

173
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.960
Did I disturb you?

174
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.920
No, none of the sort.

175
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.730
Should we all have a meal together?

176
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.420
That sounds good.

177
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.870
I forgot I had an appointment for lunch.

178
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.140
Pardon?

179
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.470
This became complicated.

180
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.790
Jae Hyeon, it looks like you can eat lunch with Soo Jin.

181
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.180
- Jae Hyeon, I'll request this of you! 
 - Okay.

182
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.980
CEO! C-CEO!

183
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.450
W-Why is the CEO like that? R-Really...

184
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.760
Since it turned out this way, let's eat lunch together.

185
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.540
I brought sandwiches.

186
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.550
The two of us?

187
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.570
Just the two of us...

188
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.980
What should I do?

189
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.530
What the heck? Why isn't it here?

190
00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.300
I hid it here.

191
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.280
Ah, that's right. This is the past.

192
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.030
<i>Trash like you cannot enter.</i>

193
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.040
Hold on.

194
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.160
That's right.

195
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.170
Jin Sook, I'm sorry. I didn't want to go to this extent, but

196
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.360
I can't help it.

197
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.220
I'll try to be mindful of your privacy.

198
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.160
I'll just look for the letters. Just the letters.

199
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.810
It was here somewhere.

200
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:57.140
Jin Sook, why do you like someone like me?

201
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.510
- Be calm.
- Hey!

202
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.820
What are you doing here?

203
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.580
Oh.

204
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:18.190
I thought it was your birthday so I came to make you seaweed soup (tradition on birthdays).

205
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.430
Without the seaweed?

206
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.290
Oh, you're right.

207
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.530
I must've left the seaweed at home.

208
00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.440
I'll bring the seaweed.

209
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.630
Hey. Be honest.

210
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.180
Did you come to my house...

211
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.090
You came to steal my secret fund, right?

212
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.430
Hey! Let's not do that, between friends.

213
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.100
Hey, what are you talking about?

214
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.560
I came to make you seaweed soup.

215
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.150
Really?

216
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.790
I don't think so. Let me look.

217
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:53.930
- I said it's not!
- Look, here! Right here!

218
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.700
Hey. I told you I really didn't.

219
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.610
Anyway, I'm going to go get the seaweed. I'll see you later.

220
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.880
<i>[Military Mail] 
 [From Bong Pil to Soo Jin]</i>

221
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.230
Father! Ugh, I'm going crazy.

222
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.380
When did you buy this?

223
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.330
Come here. Give it to me.

224
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.330
You're coughing this much, yet you still want to drink this?

225
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.030
Yeah, I do. Give it to me quickly.

226
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.340
I buy you medicine every day. Father, seriously, why are you like this?

227
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.890
You're going to die at this rate!

228
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.460
Die? Who's going to die? I won't die, you punk!

229
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.160
Give it to me quickly.

230
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.780
Father. Let's go to the hospital.

231
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.030
If your body hurts, you have to go to the hospital! You can't drink  alcohol like this!

232
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.640
Hurt? Who's hurting? I'm not hurting at all.

233
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.020
And, even if I'm about to die,

234
00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.810
I won't visit that damn hospital!

235
00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.300
Why are you trying to open it?

236
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.860
I was just curious to see what you packed.

237
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.970
What the heck?

238
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.080
- What's up with you two?
- Where are you wandering around, not opening  your business?

239
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.160
Three customers came and just left.

240
00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.600
You lost at least ₩50,000.

241
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.980
How is Ahjussi?

242
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.930
Even though you're not my type, it's a pity to see you lose so much weight day after day.

243
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.400
Are you eating nowadays?

244
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.630
Jeong Ae prepared since this morning so she could give this to you.

245
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.190
Just so you know, I ate cup ramen.

246
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.920
I'm just saying.

247
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.270
Let's eat together today.

248
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.760
There are two.

249
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.590
Is it good?

250
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.800
It's so delicious.

251
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.940
Did you make this all yourself?

252
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:09.090
While living alone, the only skill that I got better at was cooking.

253
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.290
And since you were going to eat it,

254
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.170
I put in more effort in it.

255
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:26.080
I haven't been outside in a while, so it's nice.

256
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.990
You're right.

257
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.640
Isn't it frustrating to stay inside the pharmacy every day?

258
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.660
Well, yes.

259
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.170
I should meet people and get some sun,

260
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.260
but the only people I see are sick patients.

261
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.440
I might get depression at this rate.

262
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.090
A pharmacist shouldn't get depression.

263
00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.430
What do you usually do on your off-days? The pharmacy closes on some days, right?

264
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:56.860
Well, I usually sleep or meet up with friends.

265
00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.770
It's not much fun.

266
00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.410
It'd be good if you had some hobbies.

267
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.830
You should watch a movie or exercise.

268
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.540
Coming outside and taking a walk like today is good too.

269
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.630
That's right.

270
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.570
But I can't do that alone.

271
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.350
Will you do it with me, Soo Jin?

272
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.960
- M-Me?
- Yes.

273
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.830
Really?

274
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.080
Oh, my phone. I'll go answer the call.

275
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.750
Hello, manager. Yes, CEO left.

276
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.410
The photoshoot has ended.

277
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.250
I don't know. CEO left first.

278
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:08.010
I was thinking of having some leisure time like you mentioned earlier.

279
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.590
Can you help me?

280
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.920
Me?

281
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.480
Are you free tonight? I have two tickets to the movies.

282
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.630
Oh, what should I do? Today is my best friend Jin Sook's birthday.

283
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.720
Our friends are throwing her a party. I have to go there.

284
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.450
Ah, your friend who works at the kebobs place?

285
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.780
It must be fun.

286
00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.500
Can I go with you?

287
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.260
Pardon?

288
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.180
Man, this is driving me crazy.

289
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.700
I can't tell Jin Sook to give back the letters either.

290
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.420
Then I'll call my friend and see.

291
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.800
- Of course it'd be good to have more people celebrate with her. 
 - Sure.

292
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.790
Ah, those two!

293
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.590
Thank you.

294
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.290
But they seem a bit... awkward. Is it just my feeling?

295
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.770
Thank you.

296
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:16.290
Ah, they're not in a dating relationship yet.

297
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.300
- Give it to me. 
- Thank you.

298
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.850
Soo Jin! Are you done with work?

299
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.800
I went to the studio, and you weren't there.

300
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.890
What's with you? Did you eat something bad?

301
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.200
What do you mean "what" when it comes to us?

302
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.320
You're Bong Pil, right? Nice to meet you. I'm Park Jae Hyeon.

303
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:55.630
I thought you were only selling drugs in a small space, but you must've worked out.

304
00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:00.560
You too. I heard you were just preparing for the civil service exam at the studying room.

305
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.310
Wait. I'll just...

306
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.300
Oh my. Wait.

307
00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.360
What are you doing? It's so embarrassing.

308
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.900
Sorry, I'll call you. You should leave first.

309
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.110
- Yes. Call me. 
 - Okay.

310
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.780
Oh man, I should just... he's no big deal.

311
00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.540
Aren't you coming back after work? Why were you coming back with that guy?

312
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.310
How is that any of your business? So weird. Seriously.

313
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:41.370
Hey... Hey, Soo Jin! Kang Soo Jin!

314
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.090
Hey! Hey, Soo Jin!

315
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.130
I know why you're so cold towards me.

316
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.890
But it's a misunderstanding. There's a misunderstanding between us.

317
00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.870
What misunderstanding?

318
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.760
I know it's because I didn't reply to any of your letters while I was in the military.

319
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.980
But I really did reply. That...

320
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.260
You didn't receive it because of an accident in the mail delivery.

321
00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.990
An accident in the mail delivery?

322
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.240
Then are you saying someone took the letters in the middle of the delivery?

323
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.150
Yes, that's right.

324
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.160
Who exactly? Were your letters classified military secrets?

325
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.670
That... I can't tell you right now.

326
00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.080
Anyway, I'll get proof of that today, so—

327
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:35.510
Hey. Stop wasting your time on useless things. Hurry and go study.

328
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.470
Hey. Hey, Soo Jin—

329
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.130
I'm seriously going crazy.

330
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.340
Please put the clean chopsticks nicely and neatly.

331
00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.240
- Please place the menus nicely, and clean all the corners. 
 - Okay.

332
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.170
Today too, let's do our best!

333
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.940
Oh, right!

334
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.630
Hello, is it headquarters?

335
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.630
Please send twice amount of ingredients for Bong Pil kebobs today.

336
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:17.590
The customers were in an uproar because I ran out of the ingredients yesterday.

337
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.980
Ah, the ingredients for other dishes on the menu are fine.  I only need more ingredients for Bong Pil kebobs.

338
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.160
Yes. Yes, have a good day.

339
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.450
Today too, fighting!

340
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.450
Oh, what's this?

341
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:43.930
It's not here. Did Jin Sook take it?

342
00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:01.390
He said he was spending the night in the studying room.

343
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.530
Was he always this neat?

344
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.190
His desk is very neat.

345
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.970
His room is a complete mess.

346
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.850
This book is completely new.

347
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.200
You don't even need to sell this as a used book. It can pass off as new.

348
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.860
As expected, becoming a completely new person after coming back from the military was a total lie.

But how come even Seok Tae isn't here today?

352
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:41.200
He used to always be here. Was our Pil a bad influence on him?

353
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.850
Right? I guess you won't be able to face Seok Tae's father.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.860
Yoon Mi, should we change professions? Should we open a noraebang?

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:47.120
Unni, even if we open a noraebang, it seems it won't last long.

- Why do you ask? 
 - Why?

374
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.020
Just because I'm curious.

375
00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.950
I can't sleep when I'm curious.

376
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.330

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.450

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.690
It's alright.

379
00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.460

Why did you leave and lock the door when I told you I would make you seaweed soup?

Why are you fussing about seaweed soup when you don't even have seaweed?

You. You, you, you.

From carefully observing you as I travelled through time and space,

444
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:48.960
you are smiling kindly, but I already know that you're closer to a devil.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.730
Pardon?

Hey. You leave. I'm more uncomfortable because of you.

456
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.060
You bastard.

Why are you being embarrassing? Seriously!

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.420
Don't worry about him and just stay.

459
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:57.640
He's not much of a welcomed character either.

460
00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.730
No, I will leave now.

461
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:13.990
- No, it's... I mean... 
- You didn't even get to eat anything.

No, your friends are personable, enjoyable, and fun.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:41.190
Perhaps, did Pil say something offensive to you separately?

No, that friend didn't say anything.

468

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.430
I am just busy, so I'm leaving because I have to go.

471
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:55.290
But you asked if you could come to the birthday party with me,

472
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:58.690
so it doesn't make sense that you have to leave suddenly because you're busy.

473
00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:02.390
It's not like that. Don't misunderstand.

474
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:08.790
Honestly, I wanted to get to know your friends.

475
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:12.130
But if you're too greedy, you get indigestion.

476
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.970
Today, I am satisfied with just saying hello like this.

477
00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:20.770
Go on in quickly. They shouldn't stay uncomfortable because of me.

478
00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:24.010
Either way, thank you for today.

479
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.710
I'm the thankful one.

480
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:28.320
Then, I'll go.

481
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.710
Go safely.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:53.640
Jin Sook knows that you're poor, studying for the civil service exam.

503
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.780
So don't put on a show and why don't you try making a deal using something called conversation?

504
00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:00.360
No, I'm saying that's not it. I really, really bought a present today.

505
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.960
Hey, sit down. I'll pretend that I received one.

506
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.700
Hey, it's not this?

507
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.520
Military mail?

508
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.520
What is it?

509
00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.060
They're letters you sent to Soo Jin.

510
00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.150
Why is he carrying the letters he sent himself?

511
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:19.340
Hey, those aren't the present. Give it. Give it, give it.

512
00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.590
What is it? Secret letters?

513
00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:25.570
I'm telling you that's not it. Why are you looking at someone else's letters without permission?

514
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:27.790
Why? They're just letters.

515
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:30.260
- I'll leave first. 
- Hey, Jin Sook.

516

That's not it. It's... What I mean is...

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.470
Hey.

518
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:41.190
I passed. I passed, I passed! Jin Sook! Jin Sook!

519
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.930
I passed! Hey, Jin Sook, I passed— hey, Jin Sook.

520
00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:47.480
Hey, hey, Jin Sook.

521
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.500
Jin Sook!

522
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.260
What's going on?

523
00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.320
What's with the atmosphere?

524
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.790
W-what happened?

525
00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:06.500
Oh?

526
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.360
Hey Jin Sook, just a moment. One moment.

527
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.620
Yes, I took those letters.

528
00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.550
If you want to curse me out, go ahead.

529
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:20.750
I'm sorry, Jin Sook.

530
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:25.920
What are you sorry for? I'm the one who took the letters.

531
00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:33.360
Hey, curse me out. I would rather have you be angry at me!

532
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:37.660
I know it all. With what feelings you took these.

533
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:40.360
Jin Sook.

534
00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.430
I'm sorry for knowing your feelings too late.

535
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.560
If I were a little... If I were a little...

536
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.640
A little quicker about catching on...

537
00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.000
Were you going to take these and show them to Soo Jin?

538
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.230
Even if you knew my feelings you would have continued to hurt them.

539
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.990
And continued to look only at Soo Jin.

540
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.520
Jin Sook.

541
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.640
Pil...

542
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.220
I'm embarrassed that I can't look at your face,

543
00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.990
and I can't go inside to look at Soo Jin's face either because I feel sorry.

544
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.050
You figure it out well for me.

545
00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:29.670
Hey, Jin Sook. Hey, hey, hey!

546
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.160
Soo Jin.

547
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:59.670
The thing is ...

548
00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:11.910
Where I should even begin to explain, and how to explain all this... I am really not sure.

549
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.570
<i>[Military Mail]</i>

550
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:31.180
These are yours. Even though they're a bit late.

551
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:39.870
I see.

552
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.280
But ...

553
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:54.250
What good are these right now?

554
00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.010
What value do they have?

555
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.920
It's because of these letters.

556
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.380
Because you didn't receive my letters, our relationship drifted apart.

557
00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.290
So I am trying to solve the misunderstanding.

558
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.870
Pil...

559
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.470
You really don't know.

560
00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.120
Our relationship didn't have any misunderstandings from the start.

561
00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:25.100
Hey... what, what do you mean?

562
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.110
Bong Pil.

563
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:33.850
Sook... has really liked you for a long time.

564
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:45.890
I wish... that you would... not hurt Sook's heart.

565
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.370
Hey, Soo Jin.

566
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.900
Did you give up on me because of Jin Sook?

567
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:14.250
Sometimes... friendship hurts more than love.

568
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:23.190
Let's stop... Pil.

569
00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.850
Jin Sook.

570
00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.420
Why did you come? You should be hanging out more with our friends.

571
00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:18.320
What purpose does a birthday party have without the birthday girl? Everyone left, too.

572
00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.330
I feel bad.

573
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:23.250
I completely ruined the atmosphere.

574
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:27.160
I'm really disappointed in you.

575
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:34.630
As soon as I heard that I passed the civil service exam, I didn't even call my dad and ran to you.

576
00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:40.800
I wanted to tell you first, and I wanted to receive your congratulations first.

577
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:46.300
Sorry. I was really out of it.

578
00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.510
Congratulations on passing.

579
00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:58.750
You don't care whether or not I passed.

580
00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:01.750
If Pil passed, you wouldn't be like this.

581
00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:05.230
Seok Tae.

582
00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.140
Why are you suddenly like this?

583
00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.040
Do you know why I was trying to become a civil servant?

584
00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:17.380
You... said that you would like your future husband to be a civil servant, right?

585
00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:20.320
That's why I prepared for the civil service exam.

586
00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:26.920
You said that guys with short hair look cool, so I immediately shaved my head the next day.

587
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:33.500
You said you like tall guys, so even though my feet hurt so much, I stacked three shoe insoles.

588
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:41.420
My world revolves around you, so how come you don't look at me? Why?

589
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.720
Seok Tae.

590
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:56.680
You know whom I like. Why are you being like this too?

591
00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:03.640
Like how you can't give up on Pil, I can't give up on you either.

592
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.940
Even if the world can't understand me, you should understand me.

593
00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:17.180
I have something I want to show you. Follow me.

594
00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.610
Hey.

595
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.110
Look.

596
00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.470
What is it?

597
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:40.970
They are letters that Soo Jin sent to Pil ever since high school.

598
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:44.310
<i>[From Kang Soo Jin to Bong Pil]</i>

599
00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:47.020
Why do you have these?

600
00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:52.250
Sometimes, people act childish like you did.

601
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:56.890
Back then, I just hated Pil without a reason.

602
00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:59.270
Because I felt like I was getting ignored.

603
00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:03.700
So I took the letters that Soo Jin sent to Pil.

604
00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:09.630
What is the reason for showing me these?

605
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:12.020
If you read them, you'll know.

606
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:16.850
But Pil's love for Soo Jin isn't one-sided.

607
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.090
Soo Jin really likes Pil, too.

608
00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.460
You're Soo Jin's best friend.

609
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.260
For Soo Jin, can't you give up on Pil?

610
00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.780
Hey.

611
00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.480
What can I do when I can't control my own heart?

612
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:39.640
If I could, I want to change things back to how they were, too.

613
00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.600
I didn't know that

614
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.660
liking someone would become something I have to be sorry for to this many people.

615
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.270
But what can I do when I can't give up on it?

616
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:55.400
I'm not able to.

623
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:12.360
<i>But now that I'm actually here, it's a place where they stop a person. </i>

<i>Don't do this and don't do that.</i>

625

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:36.520
<i>- If you eat capsaicin, you're supposed to get a lot of adrenaline.
- Is that mine?</i>

685
00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:40.020
<i>- It's mine, right? 
- Yes, here.</i>

686
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.430
<i>When I'm sleeping... </i>

687
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:47.420
<i>- Here. It's a present. 
- What is it?</i>

688
00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:02.390
<i>What is this! If I wear this, I'm going to get in huge trouble.</i>

689
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:05.740
<i>Eat, eat. Eat first. Now.</i>

690
00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:09.790
<i>Hey, where did it go? What about—</i>

691
00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:13.010
<i>I brought it. Who do you take me for?</i>

692
00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.190
<i>Here, eat.</i>

693
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.350
<i>It's really good.</i>

694
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:31.200
♫ <i>Perhaps, to see if you mean it</i> ♫

695
00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:39.270
<i>Pil... We...</i>
♫ <i>I want to smile again</i> ♫

696
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.200
<i>Are too late.</i>

697
00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:47.200
♫ <i>My unopened heart</i> ♫

698
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:51.800
♫ <i>You comforted it</i> ♫

699
00:56:51.820 --> 00:57:00.130
♫ <i>Even though I'm scared, I opened it up all to you</i> ♫

700
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:06.610
♫ <i>We might be getting similar </i> ♫

701
00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:15.630
♫ <i>We might be able to feel each other </i> ♫

702
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:22.860
♫ <i>I know your pain now</i> ♫

703
00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:27.660
Soo Jin already decided to give up on me.

704
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.960
What else can I do?

705
00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:38.020
What should I do?

706
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:44.100
What in the world am I supposed to do to change Soo Jin's heart?!

707
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:51.880
♫ <i>My anxious heart, all of it</i> ♫

708
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:59.300
♫ <i>I want to give it all to you</i> ♫

709
00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:04.390
♫ <i>Until now, with my closed heart</i> ♫

710
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:12.000
♫ <i>I believed I could live alone</i> ♫

711
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:16.500
♫ <i>Like a fool</i> ♫

712
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:48.420
Yes, Grandma. Sorry, I woke you up when you were sleeping, huh?

713
00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:54.640
<i>No, no. My puppy, did you have a good birthday?</i>

714
00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.660
Of course, I did.

715
00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:01.930
Soo Jin made me seaweed soup, and my friends threw me a birthday party.

716
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:06.490
<i>Gosh, I'm so thankful to Soo Jin.</i>

717
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:10.090
<i>You just came back after hanging out with your friends until now?</i>

718
00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:11.830
Yes.

719
00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:20.030
Grandma... Should I pack up here and come live with you?

720
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:27.340
No... There's nothing wrong.

721
00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:30.880
I'm just tired of this neighborhood.

722
00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:36.710
Yes... If I decide, I'll let you know.

723
00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:41.740
Good night.

724
01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:18.890
<i>Jin Sook, happy birthday! From Pil.</i>

725
01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:04.000
<i>[Jin Sook, happy birthday! From Pil.]</i>

 Cheers!</i>

728
01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:25.400
<i>- The weather is nice. 
- It's nice.</i>

729
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.820
<i>Sook, what are you doing this weekend? Want to come with me somewhere?</i>

730
01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.190
<i>This weekend?</i>

731
01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.050
<i>I have somewhere I have to go.</i>

732
01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:41.060
<i>Where?</i>

733
01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.820
<i>An appointment.</i>

734
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:50.890
<i>Really? Okay, then I'll have to go alone.</i>

735
01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:55.680
<i>Sorry for making you go alone.</i>

736
01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.570
<i>But where are you going? To meet a guy?</i>

737
01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:01.460
<i>I'm not!</i>

738
01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:05.330
<i>I'm going to get some fresh air.</i>

739
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:11.190
<i>Where I go... I'll tell you after I come back.</i>

740
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:13.910
<i>Gosh. Hey.</i>

741
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:16.290
<i>Where are you going?</i>

742
01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:18.770
<i>I'll tell you after I come back.</i>

743
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:23.080
<i>What? Where are going? Are you trying to flirt with me?</i>

744
01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.840
<i>I'll tell you after I come back.</i>

745
01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.060
♫ <i>Now all of my pain to you</i> ♫

746
01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:34.790

750
01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:54.760
<i>[Manhole]</i>

751
01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.760
<i>Why are you- why are you in my room?</i>

752
01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.660
<i>I- I am marrying Jin Sook?</i>

753
01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:01.750
<i>Young master!</i>

754
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:03.850
<i>Dal Soo is a young master?</i>

755
01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:05.660
<i>Oppa, who are you?</i>

756
01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.030
<i>Which school is that woman going to?</i>

757
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:10.940
<i>Studying abroad? What is going on?</i>

758
01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.760
<i>No way... You don't know my birthday or my phone number?</i>

759
01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.430
<i>I'll write it for you. Give it.</i>

760
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:19.010
<i>The only thing I can do is to go back to the past through the manhole.</i>

761
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:22.270
<i>I'm going to get rid of all the manholes in that neighborhood.</i>

762
01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:26.340
♫ <i>Can feel you</i> ♫
