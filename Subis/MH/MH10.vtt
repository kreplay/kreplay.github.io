3
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.180
Nice weather!

4
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.720
They must be hungry.

5
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.350
For you too.

6
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.150
Here you go.

7
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.590
What are you doing? Are you watering the plants?

8
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.460
Let's eat. Eat first then continue.

9
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.780
Yum.

10
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.820
You're probably  about to gain some weight. You really eat well these days.

11
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.820
Food has been tasting like honey ever since we moved  to this place.

12
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.480
My sleep has been sweet like honey, too.

13
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.820
This place must have good feng shui.

14
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.980
Honey-like feng shui! Honey-like food, honey-like sleep, honey-like feng shui.

15
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.420
I hope you can receive all of this good  energy so that you can become rich.

16
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.960
What's so good about being rich? The more you have to protect, the  more unhappy you'll be.

17
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.940
I just  want to be happy by living a simple life like this.

18
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.410
Why? If you have money, you can buy nice clothes, travel abroad, and live in a nice house, too.

19
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.920
I'll show you that you can be happy without having a lot of money.

20
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.070
Say, ah.

21
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.370
Don't worry. I will make enough money so you can live happily.

22
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.090
Then you'll have to make as much as you can, okay?

23
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.460
Okay.

24
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.750
I wonder if Jin Sook is doing okay.

25
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.480
She's the type of girl that will somehow survive and return even if you put her in the middle of a desert.

26
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.050
She's so good at adapting wherever she goes.

27
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.490
She'll live a good life. That Jin Sook.

28
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:26.860
<i>[Episode 10: Love is something that does not follow your will]</i>

29
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.580
Is there a mosquito here?

30
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.970
So itchy.

31
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.160
Fee--

32
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.330
I can't feel anything.

33
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.370
Are you awake?

34
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.360
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

35
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.430
Hey, why are you— why are you in my room?

36
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.990
I came in the morning.

37
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.390
What's wrong? Are you scared that I might jump on you?

38
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.290
What is she saying?!

39
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.100
Hey, why are there so many mosquitoes in this room?!

40
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.050
Did you get a mosquito bite? Let me put some medicine on you.

41
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.390
Let me see.

42
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.580
Wait, wait. Don't come.

43
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.720
- I'm fine! No, just go over there!
- Let me see.

44
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.760
What's with him?

45
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.290
Hey! Seriously!

46
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.150
What's with the commotion?

47
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.190
In my room, in my room... There is...

48
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.870
What about your room?

49
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.890
Mom, in my room, there's Jin Sook. She's in my room.

50
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.020
I was worried there  for a second. She probably couldn't wait to see her groom's face so she must have went up.

51
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.820
Huh? Groom?!

52
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.810
Good morning, Mother and Father!

53
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.700
Hello, our darling Jin Sook is here.

54
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.280
Did you go upstairs because you wanted to see Pil so much?

55
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.590
If you're going to be like that, you guys should just live together.

56
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.310
But how can I do that when we're not even married yet?

57
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.400
Hey... m-marriage?

58
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.400
Hey punk, go up and get changed so we can eat!

59
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.300
<i>I'll be getting married to Jin Sook now?</i>

60
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.070
Let me go to the bathroom real quick.

61
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.400
<i>[September 7, 2017, present, 12:13PM]</i>

62
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.600
Yes, this is a dream. I'm dreaming while I'm time traveling.

63
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.720
But if this is a dream that I can't seem to wake up from despite the cold shower...

64
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.100
No, no, no...

65
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.150
This kind of dreams exists, too. Of course, they do.

66
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.050
Pil, hurry up and come out! Everyone is waiting on you!

67
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.420
How in the world did I end up in this situation where I'm about to get married to Jin Sook?

68
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.160
Damn, this manhole. This manhole!

69
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.830
My lunch time is almost over so I should hurry up and eat to head back to the post office.

70
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.130
Let's eat.

71
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.120
Hey, try to eat everything here, okay?

72
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.910
Your mom worked so hard to make all this for you, so have a grateful heart.

73
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.620
Jin Sook, try this soybean soup. I don't know if I seasoned it right though.

74
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.590
Shall I try it, now?

75
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.430
Mother, this is so good that you'll be able to sell it in New York! Thumbs up! Double thumbs up!

76
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.790
She's such a sweetheart. This girl is such a blessing to us.

77
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.590
Jin Sook, eat a lot. You eat all the good stuff here, okay?

78
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.870
Our Pil is finally fulfilling his duty as a son in the latter years of our lives.

79
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.530
I was disappointed that I didn't have a daughter, but we have a wonderful girl as a daughter-in-law. I'm so touched by this.

80
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.520
I will take good care of both of you for the rest of my life.

81
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.900
Okay, okay.

82
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.450
Have some. Hurry.

83
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.390
Say, ah. Say, ah.

84
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.940
- Huh? Why are you working by yourself? Where did Dal Soo go?
 - To the bathhouse.

85
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.570
That guy needs to take a bath. He is actually dirtier than you think.

86
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.640
Why do you care?!

87
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.790
What about your shop?! You don't have any customers?

88
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.380
I left one of the part-timers in charge and came. I need to take a break from time to time, too.

89
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.950
Why do you always take your breaks here?! Is this a rest stop on a freeway?

90
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.100
Might as well read that. It's the new volume you've been waiting for.

91
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.370
Read and leave soon.

92
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.060
I'm reading as an excuse to see you. Why else would this be...

93
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.660
What?

94
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.710
Oh, nothing.

95
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.970
Thanks. I will enjoy the read before I go.

96
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.990
Hi!

97
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.990
Oh, You're here too Oppa Goo Gil. Where's Oppa Dal Soo?

98
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.590
Dal Soo went to the bathhouse. Is this a neighborhood rest area?

99
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.370
Why is everyone gathering here for?

100
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.700
I'm here to return the DVDs. Should I just keep them?

101
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.770
No!

102
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.910
It's because all of our customers here are nothing but freeloaders!

103
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.600
Is this the public library or what?

104
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.660
You said to me that I was treating it like a rest stop. Now you're saying that it's a public library.

105
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.240
Such freeloaders.

106
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.260
Huh? Were you always into this kind of stuff?

107
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.070
England in Love?

108
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.860
No, I just watched them because the movies are set where I'm going to go study abroad.

109
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.860
I envy you so much. I wish I can go study abroad.

110
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.630
Let's go then. Let's go together.

111
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.350
Are you crazy?

112
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.090
You both are going to come to Sook's wedding photo shoot, right?

113
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.170
- Of course.
 - Of course we're going.

114
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.300
I'm going to go see Jin Sook in her wedding dress.

115
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.060
Okay, see you later then.

116
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.950
Bye!

117
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.000
I wonder if Pil will be happy.

118
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.890
What do you mean?

119
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.840
Men's first love lasts forever, you know.

120
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.720
I'm wondering if that marriage will be happy when he's leaving Soo Jin behind.

121
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:10.040
Pil only looked out for Soo Jin all his life. Like me.

122
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.580
Stop saying nonsense!

123
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.410
You going to die if you say useless things to Pil and mess everything up, got it?!

124
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.400
Soo Jin won't feel completely comfortable about this either.

125
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.150
Shut the hell up! Quickly read and quickly leave.

126
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.600
Alright.

127
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.260
- Hello, Sunbae.
 - You're here.

128
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.830
- Hello.
 - Hello.

129
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.060
How's your preparation for studying abroad coming along?

130
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.320
Just so-so.

131
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.410
You said it was England, right? I heard that the art schools there are quite famous.

132
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.430
I feel disappointed that I won't be seeing you for a few years, Soo Jin.

133
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.400
Maybe I should tag along with you.

134
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.320
Pardon?

135
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.550
We should be able to see each other if it's meant to be.

136
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.970
You're leaving so soon that you won't be able to see your friend's wedding before you go.

137
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.890
The neighborhood is flooding with news because of their wedding.

138
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:13.120
I know. It's a shame but my departure date happened to be set up that way.

139
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.260
I guess it can't be helped.

140
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.900
I'm sorry but I have to go to the studying abroad center right now.

141
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.100
Well then. CEO, I'm off now.

142
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.250
Okay!

143
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.380
You are making a lot of effort

144
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.980
but that blue bird is flying away.

145
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.960
I should've cut off those wings earlier. I guess I was one step too late.

146
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.580
Cut off her wings?

147
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.690
You are saying some scary stuff there.

148
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:45.460
I'm just saying, nothing more. I just feel that disappointed about it that's all.

149
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.700
- Thanks for the drink.
 - My pleasure.

150
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.330
Since I received an acceptance letter, I should get the visa soon, right?

151
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:03.430
Of course. Generally it's really hard to get into an art school, but since you prepared yourself so well,

152
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.170
all you have left to do is to be on that plane.

153
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.860
Oh, that's right!  Have you looked into your living quarters near the school yet?

154
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.300
No, not yet.

155
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.730
I can help you find a place near school.

156
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.070
If you can, that would be so great.

157
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.120
There are some  home stays that are affiliated with us, so I will contact them for you.

158
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.930
- Please take good care of it. 
- Of course.

159
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.450
- I will call you.
 - Go safely. Okay.

<i>[UKEC Studying Abroad Center]</i>

161
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.210
Excuse  me. Can I ask you a question?

162
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.910
Which school is that woman going to?

163
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.260
Why are you asking...

164
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.850
I overheard a bit of your conversation. I'm looking for art schools too.

165
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.580
Ah, I see.

166
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.120
- Should we have a more detailed discussion in the consultation room then?
- Sure.

167
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.210
Please come this way.

168
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.740

 - Yes?

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.010
Why? Do you regret it?

177
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.940
Uh, what do you mean regret? It's just...

178
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.720

Hey, Soo Jin! Doesn't he not look like the Bong Pil we know?

374
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:18.250
This is what I call a beautiful transformation.

375

- Of course. It's your first time. Yeah.

I oppose of this marriage.

382
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.810
I think Jin Sook is too good for this marriage.

383
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.420
Go call the cops now. We have to stop this marriage!

384
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:47.410
She doesn't look as good as me, but don't you guys still think that she's super pretty?

385
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.520
- Soo Jin, look at  Jin Sook. Doesn't she look awesome?
 - Wow.

386
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.160
- I was already pretty you know.
 - My darling Sook, you're so beautiful.

387
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.570
Hey Bong Pil, you should say something too.

388

Why are you guys being like this all of a sudden?

389
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.520
Jin Sook was already pretty. You didn't know that?

390

You didn't know that?

391
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.290
- What the?
 - What's with him?

392
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.030
Alright, let's get started.

- Yeah, a little bit more.
 - Okay, I'm going to take it now.

One, two, three.

401
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.780
- I said to smile a little bit more! 
- Why is he like that?

402
00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.160
Okay, I'm going to take it.

403
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.560
One, two, three.

404
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.020
Soo Jin, don't you have to do it this way?

405
00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.550
Okay, let's get up.

406
00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.340
Get up? Alright,  let's get up.

407
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.840
Get up, man!

408
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.760
Now, face each other.

409
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.160
Now, pose well. Okay!

410
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.850
Okay, a little bit more.

411
00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.360
One, two, three.

412
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:09.630
Does this guy have a camera-phobia or what? Pil, be a little bit more daring!

413
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.530
Like this kind of pose here. I'm telling you to do something like this.

414
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.360
- Take a picture. A picture.
 - Hold, it right there.

415
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.690
Should we do something like that too? Let's try it.

416
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.560
Let's take one that's a little more reserved.

417
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.790
Okay, let's do that. We can do a more reserved one.

418
00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.960
Okay, I'm going to take it now.

419
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.750
Hey, you guys should at least kiss! Kiss!

420
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:37.340
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss!

421
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.100
A man is supposed to take the lead and do the kissing. So hurry up and get to it!

422
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.540
Forget about it. Why is kissing necessary?

423
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.430
Bong Pil, this is a must for a wedding photo, so get to it now.

424
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.030
I told you, it's okay.

425
00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:53.160
Why are you acting so expensive today? I'll do it.

426
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.470
Hey, hold up for a second.

427
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.580
It's that...

428
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.290
It's just...

429
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.680
It's not that.

430
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.830
It's because it's a bit embarrassing to do that in front of all these people.

431
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.300
I guess Bong Pil is embarrassed in front of us.

432
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:25.230

I didn't educate my son very well, so he must be a lot of trouble for you, too.

No, that's not true. Oppa takes really good care of me...

496
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:51.920
We don't need to be welcomed by that household.

I'm sorry to say this, but love alone will never

make it happen.

505
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.400
That surprised you, right?

506
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.670
Are you okay? Don't mind what she said.

507
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.650
Oppa, who are you?

508
00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.720
Who could I be?

509
00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.800
Of course I am Dal Soo,  the cynical business partner who lives with you.

510
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:07.440
It's okay. Jeong Ae, it's okay.

511
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.900
Bye, you did such an awesome job today.

512
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.900
You  go home and get some good rest for  today.

513
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.500
We can't since we have one more thing on the schedule for today.

514
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.200
We have to get our marriage license today.

515
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:31.490
Huh? Who gets their marriage license before getting married?!

516
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:34.260
- Let's make this the last thing we do for today.
 - No way.

517
00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.560
Wow, I think highly of your driving force. My Sook is working at full speed.

518
00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.320
I have to because I have an insecurity issue.

519
00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.780
It's that kind of insecurity I feel when I don't completely finish up something.

520
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.420
You guys figure it out on your own. Now, just leave.

521
00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.490
Fine, I'm leaving! Soo Jin, thanks for everything today.

522
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.300
No problem. Congratulations.

523
00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.730
Hey Pil, you follow me.

524
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:05.830
Alright, let's go register our marriage. Let's do it.

525
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.700
Hey, who the hell are you?!

526
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:19.520
Didn't we hang out together since middle school?!

527
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.950
I really have no idea who you are supposed to be now.

528
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:25.120
I'm just Dal Soo. I'm the same Dal Soo that you know.

529
00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.920
Oh, your father  is a public servant in a countryside town.

530
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.720
And because of your family situation, you came to Seoul to live on your own. That Dal Soo, right?!

531
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.660
Or the Dal Soo who is the youngest son of  a very, very rich man. Which Dal Soo is it?!

532
00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.900
I settled over here because I hate that household, okay?

533
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.340
Goo Gil, let's not do this. It's already complicated for me.

534
00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.330
I'm sure it must be.

535
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:49.050
You must feel complicated when you think about the shock that Jeong Ae received.

536
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:56.050
I bet Jeong Ae probably thought that she could be with the person she loved as long as they liked each other.

537
00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:59.280
But because of you, that dream has been shattered.

538
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.980
It won't happen!

539
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.490
Do you want Jeong Ae to be happy?!

540
00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.980
Then you should stay out of it from now on.

541
00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.870
Go back to your own home now.

545
00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.460
You've worked hard.

546
00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.200
- Seok Tae, hold on a minute there.
 - Yes.

547
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.270
Why was that one blocked when it wasn't even connected to the sewer system?

548
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:49.780
Well when I opened up the manhole, I saw that it was completely filled with cigarette butts.

549
00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:54.120
- Cigarette butts?
 - Yes. There are so many no-smoking zones these days

550
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.210
so I'm guessing that a lot of people go all the way over there to smoke.

551
00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.230
Man, those people.

552
00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:03.200
But I think we'll be able to finish up the work by tomorrow if we work hard enough.

553
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.360
We should get rid of all the manholes and sewer tunnels in that neighborhood at this chance.

554
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.190
I heard that the higher ups are happy with how fast the civil complaints are dealt with ever since you came here.

555
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.320
Really?

556
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.450
- Keep up the good work.
 - Thank you.

So how's your work as a civil servant? Is it doable?

563
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.160
Oh yeah, it's doable.

564
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.400
That's good. Do your best, man. I'm sure you'll be a real one someday.

565

Pil. Thinking back, I've liked you very much for a long time.

At first, I thought it would be nice enough to be by your side as a good friend.

Oh, I'm just going to rest at home.

Wow, being a bachelor is so good!

718

For a married man, staying at home is a job too.

- Excuse me, customer.
- What?

724
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.700
I can't fill a prescription with this.

725
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.750
Go back to the doctor's office and get a prescription.

726

What are you talking about?  This is a prescription!

727
00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:10.860
This is a copy of a prescription.

728
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:15.010
I brought it exactly as the way they gave it to me. So don't say any more. Just give the prescription!

729
00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:18.840
You shouldn't act like this. It's illegal to fill a prescription without a prescription.
