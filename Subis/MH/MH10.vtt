3
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.180
Nice weather!

4
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.720
They must be hungry.

5
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.350
For you too.

6
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.150
Here you go.

7
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.590
What are you doing? Are you watering the plants?

8
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.460
Let's eat. Eat first then continue.

9
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.780
Yum.

10
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.820
You're probably  about to gain some weight. You really eat well these days.

11
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.820
Food has been tasting like honey ever since we moved  to this place.

12
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.480
My sleep has been sweet like honey, too.

13
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.820
This place must have good feng shui.

14
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.980
Honey-like feng shui! Honey-like food, honey-like sleep, honey-like feng shui.

15
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.420
I hope you can receive all of this good  energy so that you can become rich.

16
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.960
What's so good about being rich? The more you have to protect, the  more unhappy you'll be.

17
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.940
I just  want to be happy by living a simple life like this.

18
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.410
Why? If you have money, you can buy nice clothes, travel abroad, and live in a nice house, too.

19
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.920
I'll show you that you can be happy without having a lot of money.

20
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.070
Say, ah.

21
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.370
Don't worry. I will make enough money so you can live happily.

22
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.090
Then you'll have to make as much as you can, okay?

23
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.460
Okay.

24
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.750
I wonder if Jin Sook is doing okay.

25
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.480
She's the type of girl that will somehow survive and return even if you put her in the middle of a desert.

26
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.050
She's so good at adapting wherever she goes.

27
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.490
She'll live a good life. That Jin Sook.

28
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:26.860
<i>[Episode 10: Love is something that does not follow your will]</i>

29
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.580
Is there a mosquito here?

30
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.970
So itchy.

31
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.160
Fee--

32
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.330
I can't feel anything.

33
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.370
Are you awake?

34
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.360
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

35
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.430
Hey, why are youâ€” why are you in my room?

36
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.990
I came in the morning.

37
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.390
What's wrong? Are you scared that I might jump on you?

38
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.290
What is she saying?!

39
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.100
Hey, why are there so many mosquitoes in this room?!

40
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.050
Did you get a mosquito bite? Let me put some medicine on you.

41
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.390
Let me see.

42
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.580
Wait, wait. Don't come.

43
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.720
- I'm fine! No, just go over there!
- Let me see.

44
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.760
What's with him?

45
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.290
Hey! Seriously!

46
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.150
What's with the commotion?

47
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.190
In my room, in my room... There is...

48
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.870
What about your room?

49
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.890
Mom, in my room, there's Jin Sook. She's in my room.

50
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.020
I was worried there  for a second. She probably couldn't wait to see her groom's face so she must have went up.

51
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.820
Huh? Groom?!

52
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.810
Good morning, Mother and Father!

53
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.700
Hello, our darling Jin Sook is here.

54
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.280
Did you go upstairs because you wanted to see Pil so much?

55
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.590
If you're going to be like that, you guys should just live together.

56
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.310
But how can I do that when we're not even married yet?

57
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.400
Hey... m-marriage?

58
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.400
Hey punk, go up and get changed so we can eat!

59
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.300
<i>I'll be getting married to Jin Sook now?</i>

60
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.070
Let me go to the bathroom real quick.

61
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.400
<i>[September 7, 2017, present, 12:13PM]</i>

62
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.600
Yes, this is a dream. I'm dreaming while I'm time traveling.

63
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.720
But if this is a dream that I can't seem to wake up from despite the cold shower...

64
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.100
No, no, no...

65
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.150
This kind of dreams exists, too. Of course, they do.

66
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.050
Pil, hurry up and come out! Everyone is waiting on you!

67
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.420
How in the world did I end up in this situation where I'm about to get married to Jin Sook?

68
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.160
Damn, this manhole. This manhole!

69
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.830
My lunch time is almost over so I should hurry up and eat to head back to the post office.

70
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.130
Let's eat.

71
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.120
Hey, try to eat everything here, okay?

72
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.910
Your mom worked so hard to make all this for you, so have a grateful heart.

73
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.620
Jin Sook, try this soybean soup. I don't know if I seasoned it right though.

74
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.590
Shall I try it, now?

75
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.430
Mother, this is so good that you'll be able to sell it in New York! Thumbs up! Double thumbs up!

76
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.790
She's such a sweetheart. This girl is such a blessing to us.

77
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.590
Jin Sook, eat a lot. You eat all the good stuff here, okay?

78
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.870
Our Pil is finally fulfilling his duty as a son in the latter years of our lives.

79
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.530
I was disappointed that I didn't have a daughter, but we have a wonderful girl as a daughter-in-law. I'm so touched by this.

80
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.520
I will take good care of both of you for the rest of my life.

81
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.900
Okay, okay.

82
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.450
Have some. Hurry.

83
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.390
Say, ah. Say, ah.

84
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.940
- Huh? Why are you working by yourself? Where did Dal Soo go?
 - To the bathhouse.

85
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.570
That guy needs to take a bath. He is actually dirtier than you think.

86
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.640
Why do you care?!

87
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.790
What about your shop?! You don't have any customers?

88
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.380
I left one of the part-timers in charge and came. I need to take a break from time to time, too.

89
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.950
Why do you always take your breaks here?! Is this a rest stop on a freeway?

90
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.100
Might as well read that. It's the new volume you've been waiting for.

91
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.370
Read and leave soon.

92
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.060
I'm reading as an excuse to see you. Why else would this be...

93
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.660
What?

94
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.710
Oh, nothing.

95
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.970
Thanks. I will enjoy the read before I go.

96
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.990
Hi!

97
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.990
Oh, You're here too Oppa Goo Gil. Where's Oppa Dal Soo?

98
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.590
Dal Soo went to the bathhouse. Is this a neighborhood rest area?

99
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.370
Why is everyone gathering here for?

100
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.700
I'm here to return the DVDs. Should I just keep them?

101
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.770
No!

102
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.910
It's because all of our customers here are nothing but freeloaders!

103
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.600
Is this the public library or what?

104
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.660
You said to me that I was treating it like a rest stop. Now you're saying that it's a public library.

105
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.240
Such freeloaders.

106
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.260
Huh? Were you always into this kind of stuff?

107
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.070
England in Love?

108
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.860
No, I just watched them because the movies are set where I'm going to go study abroad.

109
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.860
I envy you so much. I wish I can go study abroad.

110
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.630
Let's go then. Let's go together.

111
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.350
Are you crazy?

112
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.090
You both are going to come to Sook's wedding photo shoot, right?

113
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.170
- Of course.
 - Of course we're going.

114
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.300
I'm going to go see Jin Sook in her wedding dress.

115
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.060
Okay, see you later then.

116
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.950
Bye!

117
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.000
I wonder if Pil will be happy.

118
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.890
What do you mean?

119
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.840
Men's first love lasts forever, you know.

120
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.720
I'm wondering if that marriage will be happy when he's leaving Soo Jin behind.

121
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:10.040
Pil only looked out for Soo Jin all his life. Like me.

122
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.580
Stop saying nonsense!

123
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.410
You going to die if you say useless things to Pil and mess everything up, got it?!

124
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.400
Soo Jin won't feel completely comfortable about this either.

125
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.150
Shut the hell up! Quickly read and quickly leave.

126
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.600
Alright.

127
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.260
- Hello, Sunbae.
 - You're here.

128
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.830
- Hello.
 - Hello.

129
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.060
How's your preparation for studying abroad coming along?

130
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.320
Just so-so.

131
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.410
You said it was England, right? I heard that the art schools there are quite famous.

132
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.430
I feel disappointed that I won't be seeing you for a few years, Soo Jin.

133
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.400
Maybe I should tag along with you.

134
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.320
Pardon?

135
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.550
We should be able to see each other if it's meant to be.

136
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.970
You're leaving so soon that you won't be able to see your friend's wedding before you go.

137
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.890
The neighborhood is flooding with news because of their wedding.

138
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:13.120
I know. It's a shame but my departure date happened to be set up that way.

139
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.260
I guess it can't be helped.

140
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.900
I'm sorry but I have to go to the studying abroad center right now.

141
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.100
Well then. CEO, I'm off now.

142
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.250
Okay!

143
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.380
You are making a lot of effort

144
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.980
but that blue bird is flying away.

145
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.960
I should've cut off those wings earlier. I guess I was one step too late.

146
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.580
Cut off her wings?

147
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.690
You are saying some scary stuff there.

148
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:45.460
I'm just saying, nothing more. I just feel that disappointed about it that's all.

149
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.700
- Thanks for the drink.
 - My pleasure.

150
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.330
Since I received an acceptance letter, I should get the visa soon, right?

151
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:03.430
Of course. Generally it's really hard to get into an art school, but since you prepared yourself so well,

152
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.170
all you have left to do is to be on that plane.

153
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.860
Oh, that's right!  Have you looked into your living quarters near the school yet?

154
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.300
No, not yet.

155
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.730
I can help you find a place near school.

156
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.070
If you can, that would be so great.

157
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.120
There are some  home stays that are affiliated with us, so I will contact them for you.

158
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.930
- Please take good care of it. 
- Of course.

159
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.450
- I will call you.
 - Go safely. Okay.

<i>[UKEC Studying Abroad Center]</i>

161
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.210
Excuse  me. Can I ask you a question?

162
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.910
Which school is that woman going to?

163
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.260
Why are you asking...

164
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.850
I overheard a bit of your conversation. I'm looking for art schools too.

165
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.580
Ah, I see.

166
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.120
- Should we have a more detailed discussion in the consultation room then?
- Sure.

167
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.210
Please come this way.

168
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.740
This would be too hot, right?

Oh, this one...

170
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.690
This doesn't match well with your face.

171
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.780
Would this one be good?

172
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.400
- Jin Sook. 
 - Yes?

173
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.360
How did we become like this?

174
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.290
What are you talking about?

175
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:22.030
Well, how did we end up at this point of getting married?

176
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.010
Why? Do you regret it?

177
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.940
Uh, what do you mean regret? It's just...

178
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.720
It seems like a dream, that's why.

179
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.750
It's not a dream.

180
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.090
Hey. Wear this one.

181
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:53.870
Pink goes well with you, too. If you try, you look very handsome.

182
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.160
But where are we going?

183
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.440
We have a lot of things to do today. Get dressed quickly. I'm going to change too.

184
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.130
I'm going to change too.

185
00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:11.570
Okay. Let's not hurt Jin Sook.

186
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.340
But isn't pink a bit too much, Jin Sook?

187
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.690
Hey.

188
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.260
The weather is nice, isn't it?

189
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.450
Uh huh. It's nice.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.950
I feel like I'm chewing sand.

193
00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.530
You generally eat even sand well.

194

Seok Tae, how old are you?

I have a sister-in-law. She is very pretty.

Then you should've done it before I ordered.

226
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.490
I'm sorry. I have a lot of thoughts today.

227
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.600
But why did you order beer? Why are we day drinking?

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.630
It's coffee. Isn't it cool?

Hey. Why are you spilling it all like a child?

What? Why are you looking at me like that? It makes me embarrassed.

I'm sorry for a lot of things. I'm not much of a help to you.

233

It's okay. I know that dragging men around to prepare marriage related items is a mean thing to do.

It seems like Jae Hyeon is interested in Soo Jin,

246

Soo Jin said that she would take our wedding photos as our wedding present.

265
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.670
So she rented the studio out.

I guess so.

Hey, this is an important moment in history. I had to call all of them.

278

280
00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:01.860

291
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.600

Aigoo, you're going overboard.

Although your body is tired, isn't it fun shopping for marriage stuff with Bong Pil?

294
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.170
I have that kind of fantasy for my wedding.

295
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:49.100
I did too, but you try dragging a dead body around. I tasted death today.

296
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.390
I have to look and decide by myself. Pil is no help.

297
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.330
You're right. Bong Pil has no idea what a woman's heart is like.

298
00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.390
He's not interested in those things either.

- Hey. Is your preparation to go abroad going well?
- Yeah.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:05.270
I got the plane ticket. All I need to do is leave.

301
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.290
You should stay a little longer, make sure to come, then leave.

302
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.790
Hey, what can I do when the schedule came out that way?

303
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.790
This wench is going to bother me about this her whole life.

340

Sook might be waiting for you.

341
00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.900

You and Sook both look good together.

346
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:26.850
Bong Pil, you look great dressed up like this.

347

349
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.800
Where did Jeong Ae go?

350
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.410
She's not outside either.

351
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.630
If she's not outside, she must be inside somewhere.

352
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.850
Huh? Why would Jeong Ae be inside?

353
00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.620
I don't know.

354
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.530
Ta-da!

355
00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.900
How do I look?

356
00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.920
Wow.

357
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.240
So radiant.

358
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.320
Oh, you're blinding me!

359
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.080
Oh, I'm going blind now!

360
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.680
This is the newest model here.  Doesn't it totally look good on me? Hurry up and take a photo of me now.

361
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.190
- Okay, let's take a picture. 
- Okay, okay.

362
00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.160
- Wait a second. 
- Move over.

363
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.500
- Gosh, wait. Wait. Jeong Ae, look over here.
- Right over here. Look right in front of the camera.

364
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.430
- Jeong Ae, this way. 
- Hey.

365
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.300
Over here. Look at me now.

366
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.990
- Right in front of the camera here please. 
- Smile for me please.

367
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.250
- Move away for a second.
 - Let's take one together.

368
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.730
- Let's also take a selfie too. Ah, it came out well. 
- We all should take one now.

369
00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.440
Okay, one, two.

370
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.360
Yeah, that came out great.

371
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.210
<i>Soo Jin.</i>

372
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.720
Why are you being nervous like it's your first marri- Right, it's your first time.

373
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.270
Hey, Soo Jin! Doesn't he not look like the Bong Pil we know?

374
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:18.250
This is what I call a beautiful transformation.

375
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.590
I'm doing all kinds of things now.

376
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:24.420
- Hey, you'll do well. Don't be nervous. 
- Of course. It's your first time. Yeah.

377
00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.460
- Let's practice smiling now. Don't nervous, alright. 
- Smile. Yes.

378
00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.860
Ta-da!

379
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.790
Wow. Wow!

380
00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:36.130
Are you sure you're the Sook that drinks soju by the bottle?!

381
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:37.880
I oppose of this marriage.

382
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.810
I think Jin Sook is too good for this marriage.

383
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.420
Go call the cops now. We have to stop this marriage!

384
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:47.410
She doesn't look as good as me, but don't you guys still think that she's super pretty?

385
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.520
- Soo Jin, look at  Jin Sook. Doesn't she look awesome?
 - Wow.

386
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.160
- I was already pretty you know.
 - My darling Sook, you're so beautiful.

387
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.570
Hey Bong Pil, you should say something too.

388
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.900
Why are you guys being like this all of a sudden?

389
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.520
Jin Sook was already pretty. You didn't know that?

390
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.630
You didn't know that?

391
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.290
- What the?
 - What's with him?

392
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.030
Alright, let's get started.

393
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:11.170
Alright! The bride and the groom, enter!

394
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.730
â™« <i>You came gently to me.</i> â™«

395
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.920
Okay...

396
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.770
Ms. Bride, smile brightly and get into the groom's embrace.

397
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.700
Mr. Groom, smile brightly. I'm going to take it now.

398
00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:30.660
Hey Bong Pil, a little bit more.

399
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.830
- Yeah, a little bit more.
 - Okay, I'm going to take it now.

400
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:36.660
One, two, three.

401
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.780
- I said to smile a little bit more! 
- Why is he like that?

402
00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.160
Okay, I'm going to take it.

403
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.560
One, two, three.

404
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.020
Soo Jin, don't you have to do it this way?

405
00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.550
Okay, let's get up.

406
00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.340
Get up? Alright,  let's get up.

407
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.840
Get up, man!

408
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.760
Now, face each other.

409
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.160
Now, pose well. Okay!

410
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.850
Okay, a little bit more.

411
00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.360
One, two, three.

412
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:09.630
Does this guy have a camera-phobia or what? Pil, be a little bit more daring!

413
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.530
Like this kind of pose here. I'm telling you to do something like this.

414
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.360
- Take a picture. A picture.
 - Hold, it right there.

415
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.690
Should we do something like that too? Let's try it.

416
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.560
Let's take one that's a little more reserved.

417
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.790
Okay, let's do that. We can do a more reserved one.

418
00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.960
Okay, I'm going to take it now.

419
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.750
Hey, you guys should at least kiss! Kiss!

420
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:37.340
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss!

421
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.100
A man is supposed to take the lead and do the kissing. So hurry up and get to it!

422
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.540
Forget about it. Why is kissing necessary?

423
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.430
Bong Pil, this is a must for a wedding photo, so get to it now.

424
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.030
I told you, it's okay.

425
00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:53.160
Why are you acting so expensive today? I'll do it.

426
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.470
Hey, hold up for a second.

427
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.580
It's that...

428
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.290
It's just...

429
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.680
It's not that.

430
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.830
It's because it's a bit embarrassing to do that in front of all these people.

431
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.300
I guess Bong Pil is embarrassed in front of us.

432
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:25.230
How are you going to handle your first night at this rate?

433
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.240
â™« <i>It's uselessly pretending now to know</i> â™«

434
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:33.670

435
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.300
Yep. Let's take it now.

436
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.340
Alright, I'm going to take it for real now.

437
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.210
Going now.

438
00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.220

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.540
It's a good thing.

445
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.090
And it's something to congratulate.

447
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:28.740

450
00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.550
But they came out so pretty.

451
00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.900

What's wrong?

468
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.900
Jeong Ae, should we go somewhere and drink a cup of coffee?

That's a waste of money.

470
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.620
We're almost at your store, so why would you go to a cafe? Let's drink at your store.

Let's go, okay? Let's hurry up and go. Hurry, okay?

 - Young Master!

You should've at least called before coming.

474
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.200
If I called, would we have been able to meet?

475
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.400
You saw how I live, so please leave.

476
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.860
I will stop by the house this weekend, so we can talk then.

477
00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:24.300
Young lady, it might be rude to say this on our first meeting, but you're very pretty.

478
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.070
Thank you.

479
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:30.570
I didn't educate my son very well, so he must be a lot of trouble for you, too.

480
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:37.230
No, that's not true. Oppa takes really good care of me...

481
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.300
I'm glad that he at least treats you well.

482
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.130
But he is not going to stay here for much longer.

483
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.950
He has to go back home.

484
00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:54.680
What do you mean go back? Where would I go when this is my home?

485
00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.790
Who is that person?

486
00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:10.090
Madam? She is the young master's mother.

487
00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:14.560
Young master...? Dal Soo is a young master?

488
00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.730
Yes, he is the chairman's youngest son.

Chair... man?!

490
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:30.910
Young lady, I hate saying this to you but you two aren't meant to be together.

491
00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.920
This kind of relationship isn't welcomed in our household.

492
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.410
So just let him go.

493
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.920
Even if you hold onto him, you won't ever be able to have him anyway.

494
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:45.780
Mother, Jeong Ae has no reason to hear that from you.

495
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.550
Please go back.

496
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:51.920
We don't need to be welcomed by that household.

497
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.660
Did you say that household?

498
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.220
Yes, I did say that household!

499
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.360
I'm sorry that I barged in like this so suddenly.

500
00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.980
But young lady, you should still keep what I told you to heart.

501
00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:14.080
I don't say words that I can't keep since I married a businessman.

502

Even if you hold onto him, you won't ever be able to have him.

503
00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:24.100
I'm sorry to say this, but love alone will never

504
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.290

505
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.400
That surprised you, right?

506
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.670
Are you okay? Don't mind what she said.

507
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.650
Oppa, who are you?

508
00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.720
Who could I be?

509
00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.800
Of course I am Dal Soo,  the cynical business partner who lives with you.

510
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:07.440
It's okay. Jeong Ae, it's okay.

511
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.900
Bye, you did such an awesome job today.

512
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.900
You  go home and get some good rest for  today.

513
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.500
We can't since we have one more thing on the schedule for today.

514
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.200
We have to get our marriage license today.

515
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:31.490
Huh? Who gets their marriage license before getting married?!

516
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:34.260
- Let's make this the last thing we do for today.
 - No way.

517
00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.560
Wow, I think highly of your driving force. My Sook is working at full speed.

518
00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.320
I have to because I have an insecurity issue.

519
00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.780
It's that kind of insecurity I feel when I don't completely finish up something.

520
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.420
You guys figure it out on your own. Now, just leave.

521
00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.490
Fine, I'm leaving! Soo Jin, thanks for everything today.

522

No problem. Congratulations.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:05.830
Alright, let's go register our marriage. Let's do it.

525
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.700
Hey, who the hell are you?!

526
00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:19.520
Didn't we hang out together since middle school?!

527
00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.950
I really have no idea who you are supposed to be now.

528
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:25.120
I'm just Dal Soo. I'm the same Dal Soo that you know.

529
00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.920
Oh, your father  is a public servant in a countryside town.

530
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.720
And because of your family situation, you came to Seoul to live on your own. That Dal Soo, right?!

531
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.660
Or the Dal Soo who is the youngest son of  a very, very rich man. Which Dal Soo is it?!

532
00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.900
I settled over here because I hate that household, okay?

533
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.340
Goo Gil, let's not do this. It's already complicated for me.

534
00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.330
I'm sure it must be.

535
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:49.050
You must feel complicated when you think about the shock that Jeong Ae received.

536
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:56.050
I bet Jeong Ae probably thought that she could be with the person she loved as long as they liked each other.

537
00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:59.280
But because of you, that dream has been shattered.

538
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.980
It won't happen!

539
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.490
Do you want Jeong Ae to be happy?!

540
00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.980
Then you should stay out of it from now on.

541
00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.870
Go back to your own home now.

You've worked hard.

546
00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.200
- Seok Tae, hold on a minute there.
 - Yes.

547
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.270
Why was that one blocked when it wasn't even connected to the sewer system?

548
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:49.780
Well when I opened up the manhole, I saw that it was completely filled with cigarette butts.

549
00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:54.120
- Cigarette butts?
 - Yes. There are so many no-smoking zones these days

550
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.210
so I'm guessing that a lot of people go all the way over there to smoke.

551
00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.230
Man, those people.

552
00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:03.200
But I think we'll be able to finish up the work by tomorrow if we work hard enough.

553
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.360
We should get rid of all the manholes and sewer tunnels in that neighborhood at this chance.

554
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.190
I heard that the higher ups are happy with how fast the civil complaints are dealt with ever since you came here.

555
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.320

556
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.450
- Keep up the good work.

So how's your work as a civil servant? Is it doable?

563
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.160
Oh yeah, it's doable.

564
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.400
That's good. Do your best, man. I'm sure you'll be a real one someday.

Ah! Your vacation!  Did you decide where to go?

Oh, I'm just going to rest at home.

Wow, being a bachelor is so good!

718

For a married man, staying at home is a job too.

I can't fill a prescription with this.

725
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.750
Go back to the doctor's office and get a prescription.

What are you talking about?  This is a prescription!

This is a copy of a prescription.

728
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:15.010
I brought it exactly as the way they gave it to me. So don't say any more. Just give the prescription!

729
00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:18.840
You shouldn't act like this. It's illegal to fill a prescription without a prescription.
