<i>[Episode 5]</i>

4
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:27,638
What is it?

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,121
Joon! What brings you here?

6
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:42,932
Joon, why did you do that?

7
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:44,911
Am I that much of a joke to you?

8
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,334
Don't my words mean anything to you?

9
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:50,540
What? You're born again?

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,610
You want me to believe
that you've changed?

11
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,212
What a joke.
You haven't changed one bit.

12
00:00:55,212 --> 00:00:57,243
A rude jerk to the bone,
third generation rich guy.

13
00:00:57,243 --> 00:01:00,289
A piece of crap third generation bum!

14
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:08,966
I don't want to see you ever again.

15
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,405
I have seven million won
left to give you.

16
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,310
<i>[Mom]</i>

17
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:45,555
Mom, you no longer have a daughter.

18
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:48,117
I don't have a mom either,
so don't call me.

19
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:51,495
Sorry, Mom needed it so urgently
that I had no choice.

20
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:53,305
Even if you really needed it...

21
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:55,254
You don't know him,
so why would you accept it?

22
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:58,713
You should know him before
you just take the money.

23
00:01:58,713 --> 00:02:00,265
Why wouldn't I know him?

24
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:02,361
I've seen the young man
downstairs for years.

25
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:04,649
That means I know him somewhat.

26
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:08,859
Wait, Mom...

27
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:11,078
Who are you talking about?

28
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:14,057
Was it you?

29
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:19,657
That 10 million won...
did you give it to her?

30
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:24,344
<i>Since you brought it up...</i>

31
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:28,405
<i>does he possibly like you?</i>

32
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:30,328
He never moves away.

33
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:33,296
It seems odd that
he's stayed there for years.

34
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,593
Kwon Jae Hoon gave it to her?

35
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:42,473
That 10 million won?

36
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:53,399
<i>Yes, I gave it to her.</i>

37
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:59,644
I gave her that 10 million won, okay?

38
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:01,590
Why would you?

39
00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:08,818
- Just because.
- Just because?

40
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,806
Yes, just because.
I was worried, okay?

41
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:15,055
<i>He was worried about me?</i>

42
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:22,938
Was it possible that...

43
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:29,935
you were really worried
about my request, right?

44
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,491
What?

45
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:37,395
Wow! You truly are my friend.

46
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:40,008
I didn't even know
and tried all sorts of things.

47
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:43,906
What is that 10 million won
that it is so hard to get?

48
00:03:43,906 --> 00:03:45,950
You know, Jae Hoon?

49
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,587
You really are the best.

50
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:53,686
Thank you so much. Really, my friend.

51
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:02,450
<i>I'll make sure to pay you back
for that 10 million won.</i>

52
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:06,448
- How?
- Huh?

53
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:09,887
You got kicked out of your house and
your mom, Se Na, and brother cut you off.

54
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:13,867
They've been ordered by the CEO
to completely keep you cut off.

55
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:17,665
How will you manage
to pay off that 10 million won?

56
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:20,276
I will worry about that, my friend.

57
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:25,057
No matter what I have to do,
I just need to pay you back, right?

58
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,687
- Oh yeah?
- Yes, of course.

59
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:29,137
Then pay me within the month.

60
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:32,737
Okay.

61
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:35,396
Within the month? That quickly?

62
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:39,627
If you can't pay me back,
I'll charge you interest for late days.

63
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:42,038
<i>What? Interest?</i>

64
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:43,951
- Did you say interest?
- Yes, interest.

65
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,088
You stingy jerk!

66
00:04:58,456 --> 00:05:01,838
Hey, did Joon hear all that?

67
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:05,928
Didn't she just say "stingy jerk"?

68
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:09,338
You should pay living expenses too.

69
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:11,557
For electricity and water too.

70
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:14,786
Also, you have to pay half the rent.

71
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:18,939
Why are you suddenly being this way,
like a stingy jerk?

72
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:21,367
Because I am a stingy jerk.

73
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,875
I'm going to take all the payments,
so know that.

74
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:29,915
What is this?

75
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:34,120
Yeah, I thought so.

76
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,540
Kwon Jae Hoon is so selfish.
He would never do something for me.

77
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,492
Interest? What a stingy jerk!

78
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:44,475
My goodness.

79
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:11,081
<i>Just endure it even if
you want to spend money.</i>

80
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,624
It's not that I want to spend it.

81
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:14,449
You have to show that you are reflecting.

82
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,927
Then I have cause to go persuade Father.

83
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,286
I told you I like someone,
so Woo Sung...

84
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:21,798
I know.

85
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,050
I know. It's very hard, right?

86
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,093
You used to spend tens of million of
won a night, so you must be dying now.

87
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,223
Here's some allowance for you.

88
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:41,348
I have a lunch appointment,
so I'll get going.

89
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:44,461
Be good. See you next time.

90
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,591
This isn't it.

91
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:10,639
I used to spend
tens of millions of won a night.

92
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,264
I didn't know it was
so much money back then.

93
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:32,625
When will I repay all that money?

94
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:47,567
<i>Go to work at 4:30 a.m.?</i>

95
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,141
<i>Does that make sense?</i>

96
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:04,072
<i>What is this?</i>

97
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:07,280
<i>There are so many people
awake at this hour.</i>

98
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,397
Oh, hello.

99
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:32,648
All right, five people!

100
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:35,923
Okay! One, two, three...

101
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:36,966
Hey, be careful.

102
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,654
Four, and five.

103
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:41,057
That's all. Get going!

104
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:42,538
Go!

105
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:45,537
Three people here!

106
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:49,169
- Me, me!
- I will go!

107
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,118
<i>What is this place?</i>

108
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:03,317
<i>Is this really the Seoul
I've been living in?</i>

109
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:06,738
Joon... Joon!

110
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:07,928
Where is Joon?

111
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:10,043
Hey, what's your specialty?

112
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,397
What's your skill?

113
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,908
- I don't have anything like that.
- Ah, just miscellaneous?

114
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:16,725
No, I'm here to find my girlfriend.

115
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:19,811
Girl? Why? Did she cheat on you?

116
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:20,947
Or did she take your money?

117
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:22,195
It's not like that.

118
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:24,028
Oh, she got sold off.

119
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:26,796
What? Sold off?

120
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:28,679
There are many people like you.

121
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,091
All right, five people!

122
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,158
- Me, me!
- Me, me, me!

123
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:36,284
One, two, three, four...
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

124
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:38,307
Joon, over here.

125
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:40,009
Hello.

126
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:43,658
- I heard about the job. Where is it?
- Huh?

127
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:45,467
Mister Kim is talking to the manager.

128
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:49,128
Even if the daily pay is not high,
we want to do something stable.

129
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:50,974
It should be about five months.

130
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:53,573
Yes, so about five months straight.

131
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,923
Hey, what are you doing here?

132
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:09,783
Joon, you can't.
Don't get in there.

133
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,426
What are you saying,
showing up so suddenly?

134
00:11:11,426 --> 00:11:14,724
I can't let you be sold.
I won't ever allow it.

135
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:17,986
Hey, what are you doing?
Let me go! Let go!

136
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:19,621
What's so important about 10 million won?

137
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:21,707
Don't do this. Don't do it.

138
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:24,115
Don't ruin your life like this!

139
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,980
Move! Get away from me.

140
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,018
I'll repay it. I'll pay it back for you.

141
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:30,510
So, Joon... Joon...

142
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,230
What are you two doing?

143
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,535
Are you two filming a movie?

144
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:35,802
What's the genre? Romance or comedy?

145
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:38,642
Can't you tell? It's romance.

146
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,681
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?

147
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,428
- You weren't getting sold off?
- Sold?

148
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:46,571
To whom? Where to? Why?

149
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,551
- This man over there said--
- Cut.

150
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:50,251
This isn't romance. It's a documentary.

151
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,914
Catch the girlfriend
who's being sold off.

152
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:57,543
What is this, so early in the morning?

153
00:11:57,543 --> 00:11:59,864
Gosh.

154
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:02,144
Take me too if you're going.

155
00:12:02,144 --> 00:12:04,020
Where do you think you're going?

156
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,761
Wherever you're going,
I'm going if you're going.

157
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:07,932
You'll regret it.

158
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:10,981
There's no such thing as regret
if I'm with you.

159
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,121
This works out since
we were short a member.

160
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:15,331
No, Madam Ahn.

161
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:17,462
Hey, now. What do you mean, no?

162
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:19,292
What do you mean though, Madam Ahn?

163
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,442
We were short one person.

164
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:24,701
The company wanted five people.

165
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:28,602
Oh, is that right? That's great.
Three, four, and five including me.

166
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:30,121
Get out while I'm being nice.

167
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:32,201
Don't be like that
and let's take him with us, Joon.

168
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:35,615
No, I got fired from the hotel and
the construction site because of him.

169
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:38,726
We shouldn't get mixed up with him.

170
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:41,177
You all saw how I got
kicked out in the nude, right?

171
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,366
I need money. I have to earn on my own.

172
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:46,057
Please take me.

173
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,096
I told you to get out now.

174
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:49,817
I said I'm going to go.

175
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:52,855
Why don't we take a vote, then?

176
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,261
- I say yes.
- Mister Kim!

177
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:55,714
- Me too.
- Madam Ahn!

178
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:57,793
- Me too.
- Me too!

179
00:12:57,793 --> 00:12:59,178
That's four votes of "yes".

180
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,240
A "no" wouldn't matter.
That's done.

181
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,062
- Hey!
- Let's go, driver.

182
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:12,984
Where are we going and what's the job?

183
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:14,260
Building cleaning.

184
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,947
Building cleaning? Where?

185
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:34,303
Why here of all places?

186
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:39,908
Yes, it's here of all places.

187
00:13:39,908 --> 00:13:42,774
We ended up at
a better place than I imagined.

188
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:45,918
Why? Why? How? For what reason?

189
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:47,648
We came here through an agency.

190
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:49,437
We just went where they told us to.

191
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:52,576
How can that be?
Is this some sort of job fraud?

192
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:54,857
What? You can't do it?

193
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:57,236
When did I say I can't do it?

194
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:02,172
I was just a slightly taken aback
because it's my father's company.

195
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:05,234
Then how come you can't go in
and you're standing there?

196
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:08,509
I don't know, Joon.
Why am I like this?

197
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:11,256
Joon, why am I acting like this?

198
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:18,629
My name is Kwon Jae Hoon.
Let's work well together.

199
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:22,918
Let's work well together.

200
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:26,876
Welcome.

201
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:37,649
<i>Move into Strategic Planning today.</i>

202
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:39,712
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

203
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,873
I promised you that.

204
00:14:42,873 --> 00:14:47,804
In return, I need to know what
Managing Director Seol is up to.

205
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:52,100
You understand what I mean, right?

206
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,636
Let's work well together,
Director Seol.

207
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:09,934
All right, then.
Let's work, everyone.

208
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:12,826
Goodbye, Director Seol.

209
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,149
- Did he get in through connections?
- Yes, he did.

210
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,543
- He has connections.
- Yes.

211
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,751
What about Section Chief Yang?

212
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:37,510
What are you going to say?

213
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,541
What is there to say?

214
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,750
What are you doing?
Hurry up and come on out.

215
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:49,309
This isn't right.

216
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:51,409
Do I have to wear this?

217
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,706
Why? Are you embarrassed?

218
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,259
I'm not embarrassed.

219
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,149
What if someone recognizes me?

220
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:03,860
I was someone who took photos
in front of the prosecutor's office.

221
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:06,495
I am my father's son.

222
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:07,932
Should we make a bet?

223
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:12,150
I bet you 10,000 won
that no one recognizes you.

224
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:15,349
Really.

225
00:16:21,602 --> 00:16:23,431
Wait up.

226
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:46,850
You see. He recognized me right away.

227
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:49,918
Yes, it is me.

228
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,005
How unlikely for
a young punk to do this job.

229
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,601
You don't have any sort of
physical defects, do you?

230
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:04,878
Of course not. He is very fit.

231
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:11,325
I won't say this twice,
so everyone focus and listen.

232
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:14,519
Get here on time and
if any rascal doesn't work their hours

233
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,808
they'll get demerit points and
it'll affect the next contract.

234
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:18,373
So, don't complain later.

235
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:20,928
You'll be in charge of
floors 7, 8, 9, and 10.

236
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:23,198
Clean the offices, restrooms,
hallways, and so on.

237
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:26,347
You must take care of it all,
especially the 8th floor men's restroom.

238
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:28,607
The third stall toilet
clogs easily and overflows

239
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:30,868
if you don't see to it promptly.

240
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:32,498
That's all!

241
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:37,260
What are you doing?

242
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,864
Why aren't you all
running along to go work?

243
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:45,345
Excuse me, could you be
careful with your words?

244
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:49,790
We are employees who provide labor
and get paid fairly for our work.

245
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,693
Using words like "punk"
or "rascal" to describe us...

246
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:56,150
I would appreciate it
if you refrained from that.

247
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,000
What's with this crazy wench?

248
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,011
I'm not crazy or a wench.

249
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:02,221
My name is Baek Joon and
I'm this group's team leader.

250
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:05,356
So, please refer to me as
Team Leader Baek Joon.

251
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:07,586
That would work for me.

252
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,165
So, we are in charge of
floors 7, 8, 9, and 10.

253
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:12,478
Let's gather our strength
and go work today.

254
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:14,007
Let's go!

255
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:20,172
That... that...

256
00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:21,965
Excuse me.

257
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:24,934
Do you really not know who I am?

258
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:28,412
Who are you!

259
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:40,070
That man probably never watches the news.

260
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,898
Anyone who is cultured and knows
current events would know me, right?

261
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:46,147
Yes, yes. Sure.

262
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:47,952
Excuse me!

263
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:49,762
Yes?

264
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:54,986
See? Finally, someone recognizes me.

265
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,109
Yes, it's me.

266
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:59,410
You see these empty cups
in this potted plant?

267
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,431
Please clean them up.

268
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,753
Yes, we will.

269
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,450
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

270
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,609
Someone spilled coffee by the elevator.
Can you clean it up?

271
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,903
We'll take care of it soon.

272
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:31,858
<i>What is this?</i>

273
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:35,842
<i>How come no one recognizes me?</i>

274
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:46,420
<i>It's like we're in the same place,
but I'm in a different dimension.</i>

275
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,846
<i>They are not aware of me.</i>

276
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:54,855
Once you put on this uniform,
your face disappears.

277
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:59,144
To put it simply,
it's like an invisibility cloak.

278
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:00,174
An invisibility cloak?

279
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:02,945
Why are you acting
as if you never did it?

280
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:04,428
Follow me.

281
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:04,909
<i>Now that I was in a different position,
I started to see it.</i>

282
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:07,896
<i>It wasn't so obvious.</i>

283
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:12,056
<i>But the discriminatory way people
looked at you definitely existed.</i>

284
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:15,195
Everyone, come over here. Come here.

285
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:16,269
All right.

286
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:20,259
Oh no. You can stay seated.

287
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:23,430
Hey, that's funny.

288
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,239
- Is that you?
- It is.

289
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:27,453
- It's Manager Kim, right?
- Yes, it is.

290
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,666
- How insane.
- What's with you, Manager Kim?

291
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,398
- Who did this?
- It was Sang Hyun.

292
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:36,997
<i>Only a person being discriminated against
could know this strange alienation.</i>

293
00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:04,607
It is you, Joon.

294
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:07,251
Hello.

295
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:09,621
I thought I was mistaken at first.

296
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:19,817
You were selling smoothies before.
When did you switch to cleaning?

297
00:22:19,817 --> 00:22:23,675
I know. It just worked out that way.

298
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:26,734
Things aren't hard for you?

299
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:30,078
No, what isn't hard in this world?

300
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:32,170
We just hold on and do it.

301
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:39,041
Don't worry too much.
I'm living very well.

302
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:42,824
All right.

303
00:22:45,388 --> 00:22:48,659
I should get back to work.

304
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:24,010
Manager Baek.

305
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:28,967
I'm sorry I could not protect you.

306
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:31,968
I'm sorry.

307
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:52,483
Oh, what is this? Oh!

308
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:55,080
What do I do?

309
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,817
Joon, there's big trouble!

310
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:03,125
Big trouble! It's an emergency!
An emergency!

311
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,634
Joon... Joon!

312
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:07,277
Oh, this is insane. What do I do?

313
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:08,928
- Joon, Joon!
- The pizza is good.

314
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:12,228
- Yes.
- There are so many people though.

315
00:25:20,037 --> 00:25:21,792
- It's so good.
- Oh, really?

316
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:23,689
I should go.

317
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:32,797
What is this smell in here?

318
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,273
It smells like sesame oil.

319
00:25:34,273 --> 00:25:38,209
How insane.
Someone must be eating kimbap in here.

320
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:01,029
Wasn't she delivering smoothies
a little while ago?

321
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:02,943
Yes, what's she doing here?

322
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:04,227
I don't know.

323
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:08,594
Isn't cleaning restrooms a bit too much?

324
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:10,773
It must pay more.

325
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:44,488
Hey! Why are you in the women's restroom?

326
00:26:44,488 --> 00:26:45,632
Are you really a pervert?

327
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,503
No, no, no.

328
00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:49,807
I had a reason for coming, Joon.

329
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:52,385
Reason? What reason is that?

330
00:26:56,425 --> 00:26:59,096
This is the problematic toilet
in the third stall?

331
00:26:59,096 --> 00:27:00,435
What should I do?

332
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:02,442
Should I bring in a professional?

333
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:04,250
How about Mister Kim or Mister Lee?

334
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,931
- 100,000 won.
- 100,000 won?

335
00:27:05,931 --> 00:27:06,932
For what?

336
00:27:06,932 --> 00:27:09,471
I'll do this for you,
so subtract 100,000 won for me.

337
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:11,175
Subtract 100,000 won? What do you mean?

338
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:13,814
I already paid back 3 million won
of the 10 million won.

339
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:16,788
You owe me 5 million won
for the escape from the hotel.

340
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:19,117
Subtract 100,000 won from the
remaining 2 million won I owe.

341
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:21,877
You can do this yourself?

342
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:46,028
I'm going in.

343
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,948
The sound of that flush.

344
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,219
Did you see that?

345
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:15,387
Push, pop, push, pop, push, push, pop.

346
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:16,666
Then pop!

347
00:28:27,537 --> 00:28:30,267
You don't need to be good at this.

348
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:33,077
It just makes my heart ache.

349
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:35,857
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

350
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:38,252
Bye, everyone. Goodbye!

351
00:28:38,252 --> 00:28:40,486
Get home safe, everyone. Goodbye.

352
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,561
- Good work.
- Good work, everyone.

353
00:28:42,561 --> 00:28:44,346
Good job, everyone.

354
00:28:44,346 --> 00:28:46,414
Bye. Good job.

355
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:48,435
- Goodbye.
- Good work.

356
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,595
Good job.

357
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,557
- Good job.
- Manager.

358
00:28:52,557 --> 00:28:55,873
See you tomorrow. Thank you.

359
00:28:55,873 --> 00:28:57,369
Thanks.

360
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,497
He's so petty.

361
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:02,547
So, how was work?

362
00:29:02,547 --> 00:29:05,951
I think it's actually much better here.

363
00:29:05,951 --> 00:29:08,236
It's a hundred and
a thousand times better.

364
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:09,848
<i>Joon.</i>

365
00:29:10,824 --> 00:29:12,412
<i>Are you really okay?</i>

366
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:14,890
It's all thanks to Joon.

367
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:42,384
<i>Are you truly all right?</i>

368
00:29:42,384 --> 00:29:44,993
What I do is not what's important.

369
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:48,134
Isn't it how I live that's important?

370
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:51,066
How you live is more important?

371
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:55,377
It's up to the individual to
find confidence in what they do.

372
00:29:56,724 --> 00:30:00,840
<i>You pretended to be
so strong in your words.</i>

373
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,380
<i>Honestly... it's hard
for you too, isn't it?</i>

374
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,519
<i>He likes you.</i>

375
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,160
Likes me? Who?

376
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,170
That third generation rich punk.

377
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,981
Who does he like?

378
00:30:38,981 --> 00:30:41,428
You, of course.

379
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:45,509
Ha Yeon Hee,
just eat your spicy rice cakes.

380
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,170
I'm telling you I'm right.

381
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:15,435
It doesn't make sense, otherwise.

382
00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:17,997
He's the third generation son
of Gangsu Group.

383
00:31:17,997 --> 00:31:20,467
Why would he be doing a job cleaning?

384
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:23,078
Especially at his company,
near his dad, at that.

385
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:25,468
I told you that he got kicked out
without any money.

386
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,119
He needs to earn money.

387
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,818
No, it's because he likes you.

388
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:31,906
I told you that's not why.

389
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:34,220
Even turning himself into the prosecutor.

390
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,846
That's because he did something wrong.

391
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:39,566
Then, what about the 10 million won?

392
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:43,296
Well, that's...

393
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,741
He must've felt sorry for me
since he's on an elite level.

394
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:54,394
"Joon made me into a human being."

395
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:58,065
You had to see to the look
in his eye at that moment.

396
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:02,311
I'm going to eat it all if you don't.

397
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:03,791
That's total nonsense.

398
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,905
It does make sense.

399
00:32:08,015 --> 00:32:09,692
By the way...

400
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:13,574
how is that arrogant jerk
Kwon Jae Hoon doing lately?

401
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:16,545
He's taking great care
of himself, of course.

402
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:18,280
He's in the
Strategic Planning department.

403
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,644
Really?

404
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,694
I guess he's pretty talented.

405
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:27,422
Well, he seems
to work himself to death.

406
00:32:27,422 --> 00:32:30,792
He would feel very wronged
if he didn't succeed.

407
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:32,115
Right, Joon?

408
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,467
I guess so.

409
00:33:12,313 --> 00:33:14,872
What is it? Is something going on?

410
00:33:14,872 --> 00:33:17,796
Oh, no. Nothing really.

411
00:33:19,882 --> 00:33:24,403
What do you have to do to
eat in your company's cafeteria?

412
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:25,765
You need a meal ticket.

413
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:27,260
A meal ticket?

414
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,811
Where do you get that?

415
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:31,240
There's a machine that sells them
in front of the cafeteria.

416
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,836
Oh, really? It's that simple.

417
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:39,210
Why are you suddenly asking?

418
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,201
It's nothing really.

419
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:44,290
Get to work.

420
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:48,095
Hey, are those my clothes?

421
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:54,167
Hey!

422
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:01,119
Hey, you...

423
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:06,248
Don't use the third stall in the
8th floor restroom if you don't need to.

424
00:34:11,086 --> 00:34:12,815
What's he saying?

425
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:36,391
What is this? How does this work?

426
00:34:37,023 --> 00:34:40,347
- What are you doing?
- Pardon?

427
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:43,922
I was trying to buy this.
How does it work?

428
00:35:05,128 --> 00:35:07,442
What is this? Why isn't it coming out?

429
00:35:10,018 --> 00:35:13,396
Of course it wouldn't come out.
We're not employees here.

430
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:14,605
What is that?

431
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:17,802
We work in this building too.

432
00:35:17,802 --> 00:35:20,432
We are contracted employees.

433
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:22,201
We don't work for Gangsu Group.

434
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:27,911
So, only Gangsu Group employees
can eat in the cafeteria.

435
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:31,311
Only people with a Gangsu Group
ID can buy the meal tickets.

436
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:32,876
Understand, Young Master?

437
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:34,561
Oh...

438
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:01,621
<i>[Kwon Jae Hoon]</i>

439
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:17,597
What are you doing?

440
00:36:17,597 --> 00:36:20,047
What are you doing
with my employee ID?

441
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:23,717
What would I do with it?
I was just looking at it.

442
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:27,867
I was curious about what an
employee ID looked like and envied you.

443
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:29,478
Are you satisfied?

444
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,115
I'm so thirsty.

445
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:48,125
What are you doing?

446
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:53,762
Nothing, Jae Hoon. Good night.

447
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:15,353
Aren't you going to sleep?

448
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:18,420
Yes.

449
00:37:19,597 --> 00:37:22,063
I just wanted some water, Jae Hoon.

450
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:15,675
What the heck are you planning to do?

451
00:38:27,987 --> 00:38:29,625
Kwon Jae Hoon!

452
00:38:32,905 --> 00:38:35,099
Are you going to work?

453
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:37,750
What about Hyuk?

454
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,880
Why do you need Hyuk?

455
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,932
Didn't you know?

456
00:38:39,932 --> 00:38:42,909
We've been going to
work together, cleaning.

457
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:44,789
You're even cleaning now?

458
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,458
Why do you insist on doing hard jobs?

459
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,193
Why not just stick to
delivering those smoothies?

460
00:38:50,193 --> 00:38:53,530
I couldn't meet the sales quotas
and I got fired.

461
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,632
You ignored me when I needed sales,
so what is this now?

462
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:59,693
Stop being stubborn
and get a stable job.

463
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:01,882
Should I look into it for you?

464
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:04,420
- Stop. That's enough.
- Baek Joon.

465
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,782
Whatever the case, thank you.

466
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,733
For the money you gave to my mom...

467
00:39:13,204 --> 00:39:16,579
Even if Hyuk asked you,
that's a lot of money.

468
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,472
You're not usually one to do that.

469
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:21,648
It's not like Hyuk's in
a position to pay you back now.

470
00:39:22,824 --> 00:39:24,889
He'll probably pay me back
many times over later.

471
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:28,947
In the long term,
it's not a bad investment.

472
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:32,702
I suppose so.

473
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:36,115
Hyuk's father is the group's CEO
and his brother is a chief there.

474
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:38,030
Hyuk may look like that now.

475
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,804
Someday, he will be
someone big in that company.

476
00:39:41,804 --> 00:39:46,806
Wow, Kwon Jae Hoon,
you really can think ahead.

477
00:39:48,643 --> 00:39:52,420
Byun Hyuk, hey! Hurry up and come out.

478
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:14,362
How is Hyuk doing lately?

479
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:16,434
Has he contacted you, by chance?

480
00:40:16,434 --> 00:40:19,492
I didn't want to say anything
in case Father worried.

481
00:40:19,492 --> 00:40:21,862
Why? What is it?

482
00:40:21,862 --> 00:40:26,590
Hyuk came to the company recently
and asked me for some money.

483
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,911
So, did you give him some?

484
00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:31,552
- Why didn't you give him some?
- Hey!

485
00:40:31,552 --> 00:40:34,648
The one thing he can't
live without is money.

486
00:40:34,648 --> 00:40:36,894
He even went to his
older brother for money.

487
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:39,630
That must mean he's in
a dire situation, Honey.

488
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,338
I don't think that's it.

489
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:45,277
It seems he's fallen for some woman
and can't get his head on straight.

490
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:48,815
What? Hyuk has a new girlfriend?

491
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,197
What kind of woman?

492
00:40:52,197 --> 00:40:53,451
I didn't ask him that.

493
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,880
You should've asked.

494
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,791
What kind of woman, how did they meet,
and what does she look like?

495
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,510
Be quiet.

496
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:03,221
What a pathetic fellow
to think of girls in this situation.

497
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,208
Father.

498
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:09,471
I think he needs more time to grow up.

499
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:12,701
Gosh. I just don't know.

500
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:31,052
Oh, that punk Jae Hoon.

501
00:41:31,052 --> 00:41:33,201
When did he manage to take that out?

502
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:37,599
I just wanted to give Joon
a meal from the cafeteria.

503
00:41:39,282 --> 00:41:41,061
Excuse me!

504
00:41:54,503 --> 00:41:57,030
Today is the day
we shred and discard documents.

505
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,458
Thank you, then.

506
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,813
Wow!

507
00:42:58,264 --> 00:43:00,068
Good work.

508
00:43:06,963 --> 00:43:08,831
Look here, pretty pink lady.

509
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:12,034
I cleaned up all the documents,
so you can take a look.

510
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:14,454
Yes, thank you.

511
00:43:27,978 --> 00:43:30,088
What are you doing?

512
00:43:30,088 --> 00:43:33,996
Even if my job makes me
invisible to you...

513
00:43:33,996 --> 00:43:38,391
when you take a person for their work,
you should look them in the face.

514
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:41,067
That is good manners
and the right thing to do, okay?

515
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:45,550
You and I are both people
getting paid and doing a job.

516
00:43:46,054 --> 00:43:50,054
Also, you should watch
current events news.

517
00:43:50,054 --> 00:43:52,088
Currents events news.

518
00:43:56,173 --> 00:43:58,746
What is Section Chief Kwon is up to?

519
00:44:06,322 --> 00:44:08,237
Excuse me.

520
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:16,456
Uh... thank you.

521
00:44:17,007 --> 00:44:18,726
Do you really mean it?

522
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:21,097
- What?
- Are you really thankful?

523
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:23,485
Yes, well...

524
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:33,442
Then... please do me a favor.

525
00:44:33,442 --> 00:44:34,898
What?

526
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:40,561
That.

527
00:44:44,621 --> 00:44:45,851
What are these?

528
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:48,101
Can't you see? Meal tickets.

529
00:44:48,101 --> 00:44:50,210
Yes, so what should we do with them?

530
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:52,235
What else? We should go eat.

531
00:44:52,235 --> 00:44:54,894
A cafeteria meal. Let's go.

532
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:12,324
Did Kwon Jae Hoon
give you those meal tickets?

533
00:45:12,324 --> 00:45:17,865
Hey, now. These are sacred meal tickets
that I earned through my hard work.

534
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:21,793
Still, you didn't need to do this.

535
00:45:21,793 --> 00:45:23,353
Don't worry about it.

536
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:27,934
We're wearing invisibility cloaks,
so no one can see us, right?

537
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,900
You should've gotten some for Madam Ahn,
Mister Kim, and Mister Lee too.

538
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,661
Ah, I should have.

539
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:38,255
Nonetheless, I'll enjoy the meal.

540
00:45:57,923 --> 00:45:59,773
Why aren't you eating?

541
00:45:59,773 --> 00:46:03,373
Okay, let's eat. Eat up.

542
00:46:04,186 --> 00:46:05,815
Hey!

543
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:08,875
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?

544
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:11,387
Manager, what do you think you're doing?

545
00:46:11,387 --> 00:46:13,313
Why are you eating out here?

546
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:15,436
Service workers are
not allowed in the cafeteria.

547
00:46:15,436 --> 00:46:18,875
What kind of rule is that?
You can eat if you have a meal ticket.

548
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:20,652
Let go of me and talk.

549
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:24,097
Joon, don't worry about it, and eat.

550
00:46:24,097 --> 00:46:26,644
Enough of the nonsense.
Get up now unless you want to get fired.

551
00:46:26,644 --> 00:46:30,451
We got so many complaint calls
because of you two.

552
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:32,818
Complaint calls?

553
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:35,873
- From whom?
- Joon.

554
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:39,130
Who complained when
I was just eating my meal?

555
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:43,594
I told you to do it.

556
00:46:43,594 --> 00:46:46,884
- Really, really?
- Someone believed that?

557
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:50,405
- That scoundrel.
- It's true.

558
00:46:50,405 --> 00:46:53,385
If only that were true...

559
00:46:56,822 --> 00:46:57,896
What's going on?

560
00:46:57,896 --> 00:47:01,545
Is there a law that cleaning service
employees can't eat in here?

561
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:03,126
Is it in Gangsu Group's company rules?

562
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:05,804
Bring it out if it is.

563
00:47:05,804 --> 00:47:09,634
Will you two be held responsible
if our contract is terminated?

564
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:15,545
A terminated contract
over this? How absurd.

565
00:47:15,545 --> 00:47:18,168
We clean up everything
they make a mess out of.

566
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,838
But they won't eat a meal with us.

567
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:22,496
Who was it? Huh?

568
00:47:22,496 --> 00:47:25,086
What is all this commotion about?

569
00:47:33,943 --> 00:47:35,666
Father?

570
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:45,820
Father...

571
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:48,498
You.

572
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,974
You... you little punk.

573
00:47:51,974 --> 00:47:53,032
What should we do?

574
00:47:53,032 --> 00:47:54,657
Joon.

575
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:57,192
You punk.

576
00:47:57,192 --> 00:47:59,442
What are you doing here, you punk?

577
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:00,498
Run!

578
00:48:00,498 --> 00:48:03,458
You punks! Catch them!

579
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:06,382
Catch that punk right now!

580
00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:40,523
Why are we running anyway?

581
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:43,907
I don't want you see me
get hit by my father.

582
00:48:47,213 --> 00:48:49,634
This won't do, Joon.
Let's split up.

583
00:48:49,634 --> 00:48:52,197
- What?
- We'll both get caught at this rate.

584
00:48:52,197 --> 00:48:55,853
Let's split up.
You go there. I'll go there.

585
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:57,922
Let's both survive.

586
00:48:57,922 --> 00:48:59,518
Let's go!

587
00:49:01,177 --> 00:49:04,309
Young Master, Young Master, Young Master!

588
00:49:09,817 --> 00:49:13,047
What? Hyuk is at the company?

589
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:15,963
Ah, that makes no sense.

590
00:49:15,963 --> 00:49:18,398
Why would Hyuk be a cleaner?

591
00:49:18,398 --> 00:49:20,144
I'm sure you saw wrong,
Sister-in-law.

592
00:49:20,144 --> 00:49:24,463
He got caught by my brother
and he was running away.

593
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:26,983
The company was like a wasteland.

594
00:49:26,983 --> 00:49:29,884
Oh, how embarrassing.

595
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:33,289
A household couldn't go
under this much embarrassment.

596
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:36,291
Oh, Hyuk. What is this all about?

597
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:39,811
So, has he been caught?

598
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,297
My goodness.

599
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:44,889
That rascal.

600
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:49,003
Only an ignorant person
would embarrass me like this.

601
00:49:57,938 --> 00:50:01,722
How dare he without my permission?

602
00:50:06,057 --> 00:50:08,108
That little jerk.

603
00:50:08,108 --> 00:50:11,429
How dare he crawl...

604
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:15,458
into my company.

605
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:19,179
That punk... that bastard.

606
00:50:22,632 --> 00:50:24,684
Let's wait and see.

607
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:30,177
What is this?

608
00:50:33,922 --> 00:50:36,679
Huh? Oh my goodness.

609
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:38,766
Of all things...

610
00:50:47,697 --> 00:50:49,396
<i>Hey.</i>

611
00:50:54,608 --> 00:50:57,001
Who is this playing around?

612
00:50:58,418 --> 00:51:00,527
It's me, Father.

613
00:51:03,847 --> 00:51:05,599
Hyuk, it's you?

614
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,358
Yes, Father.

615
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:11,000
It's me... Hyuk.

616
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,039
You rascal. What are you doing there?

617
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:16,139
Please listen to me for now.

618
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:19,806
Then I'll give you
what you desperately need.

619
00:51:19,806 --> 00:51:23,077
I'll give you this toilet paper.

620
00:51:23,077 --> 00:51:24,708
You little...

621
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,717
What is it? Tell me quickly.

622
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:28,547
You said to me, Father...

623
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:31,057
Live according to my will
and how I want.

624
00:51:31,057 --> 00:51:35,525
You told me to live like I wasn't
CEO Byun Gang Su's son.

625
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,048
<i>That's why I came to work here on my own.</i>

626
00:51:38,048 --> 00:51:40,646
It's the first job I chose to work.

627
00:51:40,646 --> 00:51:44,146
Still, you're going to come
when your father is relieving himself

628
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:45,606
and deal with me using toilet paper?

629
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:48,327
You don't have the right
to oppose me on this.

630
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:49,956
I'm a contract service employee.

631
00:51:49,956 --> 00:51:52,766
You can't fire me...

632
00:51:52,766 --> 00:51:53,916
CEO.

633
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:57,876
So, you're saying you're
going to keep cleaning?

634
00:51:57,876 --> 00:52:00,498
At my company? In my building?

635
00:52:00,498 --> 00:52:03,304
Yes, I am. I'm going to do it.

636
00:52:03,304 --> 00:52:05,911
You little punk.

637
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:09,413
All right, all right. I got it.

638
00:52:09,413 --> 00:52:12,556
Just give me that toilet paper.

639
00:52:12,556 --> 00:52:14,822
Then, are you giving me permission?

640
00:52:14,822 --> 00:52:17,521
I said just give me the toilet paper,
you little punk!

641
00:52:17,521 --> 00:52:21,052
Then I'll assume
you've given me permission.

642
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,536
Oh yeah, there's one more thing.

643
00:52:34,536 --> 00:52:36,123
Why, you little!

644
00:52:36,123 --> 00:52:38,382
Let us eat meals in the company.

645
00:52:38,382 --> 00:52:39,878
What?

646
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:42,663
Meals?

647
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:45,317
- Yes.
- Gosh.

648
00:52:45,317 --> 00:52:46,914
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

649
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,208
Enjoy your meal.

650
00:53:29,742 --> 00:53:32,545
I gave it to them
just like you taught me.

651
00:53:36,753 --> 00:53:38,358
I did well, right?

652
00:53:38,358 --> 00:53:40,606
It's nice having the support
of a third generation rich guy.

653
00:53:40,606 --> 00:53:44,503
Of course, this is how you
use the connections you have.

654
00:53:45,016 --> 00:53:48,983
I'll be a strong support for you.

655
00:53:48,983 --> 00:53:51,190
Whenever you need.

656
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:06,958
Everything he's doing is because of you.

657
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,512
I'm certain he likes you.
There's no doubt about it.

658
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,655
Oh, that Ha Yeon Hee.
Why did she say that nonsense?

659
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:42,998
What?

660
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:56,735
That guy.

661
00:54:56,735 --> 00:55:00,684
Well, I guess I am proud of him.

662
00:55:05,516 --> 00:55:07,561
What do you mean, cleaning service?

663
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:09,010
You can't allow that.

664
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,380
Hyuk's case is still
under review by prosecutors.

665
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,070
There are many people watching.

666
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,505
How will you handle the news
if it leaves the company?

667
00:55:15,505 --> 00:55:18,090
Huh? What?

668
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,083
Father?

669
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,735
That kid, my goodness.

670
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:25,164
It's so ridiculous,
the more I think about it.

671
00:55:25,164 --> 00:55:29,135
Hyuk used this toilet paper here

672
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:32,916
to make a deal with me of all people.

673
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:39,032
Okay, make sure no one throws
this out and leave it here for now.

674
00:55:39,032 --> 00:55:42,197
Let me see here.
Here we go.

675
00:55:42,197 --> 00:55:44,791
One, two, three.

676
00:55:45,893 --> 00:55:47,422
Hey, get in the picture too.

677
00:55:47,422 --> 00:55:49,778
One, two, three.

678
00:55:50,429 --> 00:55:55,445
I guess that monk wasn't
completely wrong either.

679
00:56:10,385 --> 00:56:12,360
Tell me the truth.

680
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,849
Did you know or not?

681
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:17,237
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

682
00:56:18,335 --> 00:56:20,601
There's nothing more to say.

683
00:56:20,601 --> 00:56:22,972
Get rid of Hyuk
from the company right now.

684
00:56:22,972 --> 00:56:26,713
Put pressure on the cleaning company
or terminate the contract now!

685
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:30,648
I will do as you order.

686
00:56:33,862 --> 00:56:38,052
However, if you want to know
what the CEO is thinking...

687
00:56:38,052 --> 00:56:43,344
isn't is better to keep him close by
rather than sending him far away?

688
00:56:43,344 --> 00:56:44,731
What?

689
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,893
That's just my opinion.

690
00:56:48,893 --> 00:56:51,233
I will do as you wish, Chief.

691
00:56:54,592 --> 00:56:56,036
Wait.

692
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,338
They do say that you should
keep your enemies close.

693
00:57:06,018 --> 00:57:07,382
All right.

694
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,594
Since things worked out this way,
keep him close and watch him.

695
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,677
Make sure you don't get betrayed, okay?

696
00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:17,277
Yes, I will do as you've ordered.

697
00:58:30,826 --> 00:58:32,686
Oh, my legs hurt.

698
00:58:32,686 --> 00:58:35,137
Joon, let's play rock, paper, scissors.

699
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,976
Why rock, paper, scissors suddenly?

700
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:38,717
Loser can give the other
a piggyback ride.

701
00:58:38,717 --> 00:58:40,777
If you lose, you give me
a piggyback ride.

702
00:58:40,777 --> 00:58:43,253
If I lose, I give you a piggyback ride.

703
00:58:45,498 --> 00:58:47,938
- It's not fun?
- Not at all.

704
00:58:54,018 --> 00:58:56,210
Want a drink of soju?

705
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:19,039
How can you be so pretty
even when you drink?

706
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:20,648
How come you're doing the cleaning job?

707
00:59:20,648 --> 00:59:24,346
Because I want to be with you.
You know that.

708
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:28,041
Oh, chicken gizzards.

709
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:31,291
Wow, Joon you are a true foodie.

710
00:59:31,291 --> 00:59:35,275
Why is there so much food
I've never tried in the world?

711
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:43,001
Anyway, thank you
for the cafeteria meal today.

712
00:59:43,001 --> 00:59:44,797
I'm the one whose thankful.

713
00:59:46,023 --> 00:59:47,666
Remember what you said.

714
00:59:47,666 --> 00:59:50,905
It's up the individual
to find their confidence.

715
00:59:50,905 --> 00:59:54,541
Because of what you said,
for the first time in my life

716
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:59,010
I was able to ask my father
for what I wanted confidently.

717
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:03,838
Everyday that I spend with you
is so fresh and new.

718
01:00:11,614 --> 01:00:13,849
Byun Hyuk.

719
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:15,791
Do you like me?

720
01:00:16,603 --> 01:00:17,983
Yes.

721
01:00:19,735 --> 01:00:21,628
Don't like me.

722
01:00:21,628 --> 01:00:22,739
Huh?

723
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:24,887
I have no time to play around.

724
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,097
I'm busy just trying to
make a living every day.

725
01:00:27,097 --> 01:00:29,335
I'm not someone who has nothing to do.

726
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:32,239
It's not that I like you
because I have nothing to do.

727
01:00:37,052 --> 01:00:38,893
I'm serious.

728
01:01:05,117 --> 01:01:07,416
Oh, my friend!

729
01:01:07,416 --> 01:01:09,425
- My friend...
- I'll have an udon.

730
01:01:09,425 --> 01:01:10,594
Okay.

731
01:01:11,637 --> 01:01:15,190
Oh, now you're ignoring us?

732
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:17,010
What made that guy so twisted?

733
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,760
That's part of his charm.

734
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,201
Do you know what
his nickname was during school?

735
01:01:21,201 --> 01:01:23,675
- Hey.
- Twisted Doughnut.

736
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:27,684
Twisted Doughnut.

737
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,081
Oh, hey, Twisted Doughnut.

738
01:01:31,081 --> 01:01:35,284
Twisted Doughnut, you buy drinks since
you're in the Strategic Planning office.

739
01:01:35,284 --> 01:01:37,833
Really? You transferred?

740
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:39,362
You must be happy.

741
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,782
Your path to success is open, bang bang.

742
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:44,264
All we do is, bang bang, unclog toilets.

743
01:01:44,264 --> 01:01:47,784
What? What's wrong with
unclogging toilets?

744
01:01:47,784 --> 01:01:49,699
Haven't you heard?

745
01:01:49,699 --> 01:01:52,539
This is the beauty of unclogging.

746
01:01:52,539 --> 01:01:54,369
- This is the beauty of unclogging?
- Yes.

747
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:56,788
You can't just do it with strength.

748
01:01:56,788 --> 01:02:00,030
You need to put the plunger
in there and use your wrists.

749
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:07,445
Left, right, left, right.
Bong, bong, bong.

750
01:02:07,445 --> 01:02:10,275
Get me to unclog
all toilets from now on.

751
01:02:10,275 --> 01:02:12,713
I am the expert in toilet unclogging.

752
01:02:14,306 --> 01:02:15,528
Unclogging a toilet.

753
01:02:15,528 --> 01:02:21,139
Left, right, left, right.
Bong, bong, bong.

754
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:29,523
"Now is the time. Woo!"

755
01:02:29,523 --> 01:02:33,809
<i>Running toward the wind
that's calling for me.</i>

756
01:02:33,809 --> 01:02:38,501
<i>Running toward the sky,
I throw my body.</i>

757
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:41,911
Oh, the lights are on in 301.

758
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:44,369
The lights are on in 301.

759
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:47,038
- Someone must've moved in.
- Someone must've moved in.

760
01:02:47,038 --> 01:02:49,527
I hope it's a good looking man.

761
01:02:49,527 --> 01:02:52,387
I hope it's a good look...

762
01:02:52,387 --> 01:02:53,554
What?

763
01:02:53,554 --> 01:02:55,548
I hope it's a pretty girl.

764
01:02:55,548 --> 01:02:58,847
All the women in this building
are too tough.

765
01:02:58,847 --> 01:03:02,536
Hey, what do you mean tough?

766
01:03:02,536 --> 01:03:04,989
Hey, Twisted Doughnut!

767
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,288
She is pretty tough.

768
01:03:07,288 --> 01:03:09,632
Wait up, friends!

769
01:03:38,518 --> 01:03:40,063
Byun Hyuk.

770
01:03:41,244 --> 01:03:43,512
Do you like me?

771
01:03:45,532 --> 01:03:48,764
Jae Hoon, do you know what?

772
01:03:50,025 --> 01:03:54,210
Earlier today,
Joon called me by my name.

773
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:56,074
She called me Byun Hyuk.

774
01:03:58,197 --> 01:04:01,675
She always referred to me as
a "third generation rich guy."

775
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:04,903
She finally called me by my name.

776
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:10,639
<i>There's a female cleaner
that Hyuk works with.</i>

777
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:18,097
They ran away from
the cafeteria holding hands.

778
01:04:18,766 --> 01:04:21,396
Find out who she is
and what kind of person she is.

779
01:04:22,967 --> 01:04:25,422
Find out her relationship to Hyuk.

780
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:29,840
Yes, CEO.

781
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:49,597
Every day that I spend with you
is so fresh and new.

782
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,043
I'm serious.

783
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:09,833
It's not that I like you
because I have nothing to do.

784
01:05:20,398 --> 01:05:23,012
Oh, so frustrating.

785
01:05:23,012 --> 01:05:25,659
Oh, what do I do?

786
01:05:36,659 --> 01:05:41,161
What do I do?
I already miss Joon.

787
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,748
Gosh... good night, Joon.

788
01:06:05,376 --> 01:06:08,818
Oh, this is seriously driving me crazy.

789
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:26,605
