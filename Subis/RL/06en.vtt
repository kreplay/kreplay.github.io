<i>[Episode 6]</i>
You know these cleaners...

5
00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:27,012
The image of them eating meals with us?

6
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:28,131
Fine!

7
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:32,353
I don't think it's right to
discriminate either.

8
00:00:32,353 --> 00:00:33,613
- But, you know...
- Yes?

9
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:35,524
It's only hard at the beginning.

10
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:38,465
Once you allow just one thing...

11
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,993
there are so many problems that follow.

12
00:00:40,993 --> 00:00:43,265
You are correct... so right.

13
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:45,844
Have a drink. Have a drink.

14
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:49,006
Will they be satisfied with
eating meals there?

15
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,375
- CEO Min.
- Yes?

16
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,512
You know how it is.

17
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:57,094
They'll ask for days off, bonuses,
break rooms, this, and that.

18
00:00:57,094 --> 00:01:01,993
They'll make requests for all of that
and it'll be such a pain for me.

19
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:05,566
We can't allow that to happen.
That cannot happen.

20
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:09,828
So, CEO Min.

21
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:12,750
You need to hire the right
people to begin with.

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,051
What if young people get together
and form a labor union?

23
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:21,718
Ah, yes.

24
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:26,995
<i>I love you.</i>

25
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,632
I love you.

26
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:20,883
Joon.

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,800
You... why are you here?

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,062
How? Why? Why? Why?

29
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:28,975
Don't you remember last night?

30
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:31,865
Last night?

31
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,055
You need to take
responsibility for me now.

32
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:41,730
Why do I have to do that?
Why do I have to take responsibility?

33
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,262
What... what did I do?

34
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:46,372
Don't you remember
what you said to me last night?

35
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:48,888
What did I say?

36
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,020
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

37
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,144
What is that?

38
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:56,763
Come on now.

39
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:58,463
You know.

40
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:00,580
- I don't know.
- Beep, beep, beep, beep.

41
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,873
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

42
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:11,082
This isn't right.

43
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:19,858
No.

44
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,633
Get away. Get away!

45
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:47,967
Seriously, I don't know.

46
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:01,126
I'm going insane.

47
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:10,002
Oh, I must be crazy!

48
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:35,959
<i>I love you. I love you. I love you.</i>

49
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,786
Ah, I'm crazy. I'm crazy.

50
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,642
Joon!

51
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:00,992
What are you doing here?

52
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:02,759
You slept in so I came to wake you.

53
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,422
That's what I'm saying.

54
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,252
What?

55
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:08,353
Well, you know.

56
00:05:08,353 --> 00:05:10,262
I don't know. I'm late.

57
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,622
Wait for me!

58
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,329
I'm crazy, so crazy.

59
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:31,233
I don't know.

60
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,997
Joon!

61
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:36,146
What's with her?

62
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:37,446
Must be because she's late.

63
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:38,641
These are yours.

64
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,584
Get it together.

65
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,108
Joon, wait for me!

66
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:04,312
- Joon.
- Huh?

67
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:07,583
Are you sick or something?
You don't look so good.

68
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,745
Ah, no. It's nothing.

69
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:15,934
Sorry.

70
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:18,726
Is it a cold?

71
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:26,053
Gosh, drive carefully.

72
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:04,850
- Hold on, Joon.
- Huh?

73
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:11,966
What.. what are you doing?

74
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,843
I think you have a fever.

75
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:20,880
A fever?

76
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:26,045
I'm totally okay.

77
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,925
Oh, we're here.
Let's get out.

78
00:07:32,473 --> 00:07:35,355
What a terrible driver!

79
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:38,449
Joon.

80
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:40,730
Why aren't they here?

81
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,774
Someone's here, someone's here.

82
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,069
Why is that guy here?

83
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:54,298
He isn't the CEO
of this cleaning company, is he?

84
00:07:57,488 --> 00:08:02,389
I heard from the section chief that
an unfortunate event occurred yesterday.

85
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:07,653
When one or two muddy the waters and
our clients start to become unhappy

86
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,862
they will not re-sign
their contract with us.

87
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:19,788
Hey, why do you have come
into the same one as me?

88
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:21,798
Are you all right?
You don't look so well.

89
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:25,456
<i>How could you all protest
in front of the company employees?</i>

90
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:28,767
What if your actions cause
Gangsu Group to terminate the contract?

91
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,367
That means all of you
here will get fired.

92
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:33,496
It will only cause pain for all of you.

93
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:37,618
I won't make this long.

94
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:41,147
Who is the person
who caused the problem yesterday?

95
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,269
Step forward.

96
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:49,710
I want the leader to come out!

97
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,653
We're sorry we're late.

98
00:08:56,652 --> 00:08:57,732
What do we do?

99
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:03,162
Wait.

100
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:06,022
What's with you two?

101
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:08,484
You...

102
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:16,495
They are the ones who didn't
know their place yesterday.

103
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:26,134
What? The chairman's second son?

104
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:28,572
What is the meaning of this?

105
00:09:28,572 --> 00:09:33,312
Is this a test from Gangsu Group with
the upcoming contract renewal?

106
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:36,153
Well, I never received any such orders.

107
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:40,423
What's going on?

108
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:42,154
Oh, Chief!

109
00:09:42,154 --> 00:09:45,105
I'm glad you're here.

110
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:46,283
What's the problem?

111
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:50,303
Ah, well to be honest...

112
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:51,923
I should've introduced myself earlier.

113
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:54,323
I am CEO Min Sang Ho
of Hangang Services.

114
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:58,505
Yes. It's an honor.

115
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,745
The thing is, Sir...

116
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:11,053
Don't worry about it
too much. Go on as usual.

117
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:12,677
Yes, I will.

118
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:17,245
Regarding any issues
caused by Mister Byun Hyuk

119
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:20,298
I'll do what I can to handle
the public opinion.

120
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:22,038
All you need to do is say the word.

121
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,466
What do you mean handle public opinion?

122
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:27,866
Are you implying this
is all a show for the public?

123
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:30,638
Pardon? Of course, not.

124
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:32,668
That wasn't my intent at all.

125
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:34,847
He won't need special
treatment as the employer's son.

126
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,818
Treat Hyuk like any other employee.

127
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:39,288
The same?

128
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,586
Yes, the same.

129
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:45,846
The same without any special treatment.

130
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:49,636
If I hear that he's getting
special "Golden Spoon" treatment

131
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:52,960
I won't stand for it.

132
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,982
Do you understand my meaning?

133
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:58,972
Yes, I understand your meaning.

134
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:03,543
It would be an honor if I could
meet with you another time.

135
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,741
Yeah.

136
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:29,596
Push, pop, push, pop, push, pop.

137
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:33,154
Joon, did you see?

138
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:34,445
Today is all clear!

139
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,125
Flush, flush!

140
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,336
You did well.

141
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:40,527
Can you come out for a bit?

142
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:45,486
Gosh, seriously.

143
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:54,038
Are the facilities managers
doing their jobs or not?

144
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:56,796
They should figure out
the source of the problem and fix it.

145
00:11:56,796 --> 00:11:59,395
Is it the toilet or the drain?

146
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:00,793
Don't you agree, Joon?

147
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:03,126
That's how management usually is.

148
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:06,298
Rather than taking countermeasures,
they work harder on the aftermath.

149
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,447
That includes your older brother.

150
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:12,557
Come on, Joon.

151
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:16,759
Including my brother
in that group is upsetting to me.

152
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,769
My older brother
isn't that kind of person.

153
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,100
You trust your brother that much?

154
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,298
Of course. I may not trust my father.

155
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:23,679
I can trust my brother though.

156
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,118
Even if everyone turns on me,
he will be on my side until the end.

157
00:12:28,118 --> 00:12:30,485
Yeah? Really?

158
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:32,296
Of course, really.

159
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:39,284
That's a relief if it's true.

160
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:40,981
Joon, Mister Byun.

161
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:42,315
- Come have some coffee.
- Okay.

162
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:43,883
- Come on.
- Okay.

163
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:50,807
Her nuance makes me feel uneasy.

164
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:53,836
Joon!

165
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:02,746
What should I do with them?

166
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:04,404
What are you conflicted about?

167
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:06,061
He said don't treat them any differently.

168
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:08,633
Ah, I see. I understand.

169
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,812
I'll fire them all today.

170
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:15,243
No need to do that and
make things noisy.

171
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:18,162
- What?
- Make them quit on their own.

172
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:20,980
You can do that, right?

173
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,080
Ah... yes. I can.

174
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,445
I understand.

175
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,235
Do you have a list of the VJs
who do eating programs?

176
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:40,245
Yes, about 100.

177
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:42,674
What about magazine
editors and reporters?

178
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:44,743
Yes, we're waiting to hear from them.

179
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:48,168
Oh, it'll resolve itself
if you wait, won't it?

180
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:51,587
Call them yourself
and check. Hurry it up.

181
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:53,427
Yes, Section Chief.

182
00:13:53,427 --> 00:13:56,828
We don't have much time until
the event, so be on your toes.

183
00:13:56,828 --> 00:13:58,979
- Yes, I understand.
- Yes.

184
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:00,248
Also, Section Chief Kwon.

185
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:03,155
Yes?

186
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:05,774
For the sampling event of
the new food product...

187
00:14:05,774 --> 00:14:08,804
Section Chief Kwon,
you can plan the entire thing.

188
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:13,615
Me?

189
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:16,005
Yes, I'm talking about you.

190
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:21,986
Take charge and plan
the event so that it's a success.

191
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,855
Yes, I'll work hard.

192
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:28,379
Don't work hard.

193
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,197
You need to do it well.

194
00:14:42,635 --> 00:14:44,082
<i>[Father] </i>

195
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,788
Yes, Managing Director.
I did as you told me.

196
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:06,823
<i>[Employee Profile]</i>

197
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:13,673
<i>[Kwon Jae Hoon]</i>

198
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:25,736
Oh, Jae Hoon.
Sorry to call when you're busy.

199
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:27,725
What is it?

200
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:29,114
Well, the thing is...

201
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:38,330
I came to see Hyuk, Section Chief Kwon.

202
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,320
I heard he had an odd job here,
so I came to see for myself.

203
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,832
Where is my Hyuk?

204
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:46,840
Hm?

205
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,725
Where is he?

206
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:09,649
What is this?

207
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,960
Why are we suddenly in charge of this?

208
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,129
People's jobs can change
depending on the situation.

209
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:17,389
Why are you arguing about it?

210
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:19,659
Did CEO Min tell you to do this?

211
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:26,467
Well, who told you to go
eat in the employee cafeteria?

212
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:31,927
You're telling me this is
because we ate in the cafeteria?

213
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:34,812
So, is CEO Min is giving us
a taste of our own medicine?

214
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,046
Forget it.

215
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:39,004
You are all in charge
of this today, so just know that.

216
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:41,934
It's no fun if you walk off on the job.

217
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,166
You know the terms
of your contract very well.

218
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,240
So, you shouldn't need
much explanation, right?

219
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,206
That guy...

220
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:53,751
What is so wrong
about eating in the cafeteria?

221
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:55,797
Does this make sense?

222
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:58,706
Seems like this is about Mister Byun.

223
00:16:58,706 --> 00:17:01,655
He's getting revenge
for the brick on his head, right?

224
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:05,222
Still, he is the chairman's
son. I doubt it.

225
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:07,335
My goodness.

226
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:09,753
By the way, where is Mister Byun?

227
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:12,804
You're right.
They took him somewhere else.

228
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:14,314
I don't see him at all.

229
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:22,164
What? Mister... Mister Byun Hyuk?

230
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:25,085
Yes, his mother is looking for him.

231
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,666
Where is Hyuk now?

232
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,315
Ah, wait... wait... wait a moment.

233
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,210
Yes, Manager Jung.
It's me, Section Chief Gong.

234
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,717
Yes, about Mister... Mister Byun Hyuk.

235
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:43,500
Yes, yes. The chairman's second son.

236
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,991
Can you get him over here now?

237
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:47,800
Oh, about that...

238
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,212
I received orders that I shouldn't treat
him special as the employer's son.

239
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:53,982
Where is he right now?

240
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:57,905
What? What did you say?

241
00:17:57,905 --> 00:17:59,965
Where?

242
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,887
Ah... ah.

243
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:26,080
What is it? Section Chief Gong!

244
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,346
What... what are we to do?

245
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:35,615
What?

246
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:00,961
<i>Oh, Mom!</i>

247
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:03,852
Oh... oh my, oh my, oh my!

248
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,683
Oh my, oh my, oh my!

249
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:09,019
Hyuk!

250
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:12,564
Oh my, oh my! Oh my, hey. Oh my!

251
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:13,607
Get down.

252
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:15,885
Mom, I'm flying.

253
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:18,152
No, no. Don't do that. Get down.

254
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:19,494
Oh no! No!

255
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:21,343
Hey!

256
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:24,171
No, no Hyuk! Get down. Get down!

257
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:27,247
No, no! You can't do that! No!

258
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:29,839
Stop that. Stop that and come down!

259
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:33,557
Honey!

260
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:37,212
Honey, honey, honey!

261
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:41,538
What brings you here?

262
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:43,212
What do you mean?

263
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:46,012
How could say such a thing like
nothing's going on?

264
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:50,452
Are you this calm knowing what our
Hyuk is doing right now?

265
00:19:50,452 --> 00:19:52,722
He's probably cleaning something.

266
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:56,313
It's not just regular cleaning!

267
00:19:56,313 --> 00:19:58,462
He's working hard at his job.

268
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:01,333
Don't sway him and weaken him.

269
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,162
Because you always protect him...

270
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,692
Hyuk has always been weak.

271
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:09,432
Weak?

272
00:20:09,432 --> 00:20:12,924
Is that why you hung Hyuk
out there like that?

273
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:17,753
Hung him out? What are you talking about?

274
00:20:32,373 --> 00:20:35,271
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

275
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:39,686
Oh! He's cleaning the exterior today.

276
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,710
This kid is tougher than I thought.

277
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,166
Father!

278
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,104
Yeah.

279
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:48,619
My goodness.
How can you say that after seeing him?

280
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:51,599
What if there's an accident
while he's out there?

281
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,998
Gangsu!

282
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:57,096
Keep it up.

283
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:03,205
What is our Hyuk going to do?

284
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:05,577
I'm going to go insane!

285
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:07,740
Find out who it is right now.

286
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,021
Find out right now who put my child
on that dangerous thing.

287
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,880
Picture.

288
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,690
- Gangsu!
- I like it.

289
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,616
Honey!

290
00:21:19,732 --> 00:21:21,873
One, two, three.

291
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:25,539
<i>Stay still.</i>

292
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:28,018
<i>One, two, three.</i>

293
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:32,749
What? Cleaning the exterior?

294
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,410
Must you guys do
dangerous things like that?

295
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,988
That man, CEO Min, is crazy.

296
00:21:40,988 --> 00:21:43,049
CEO Min?

297
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:44,498
What are you talking about?

298
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:48,528
Hey, explain to me what's going on.

299
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:50,009
And where are you right now?

300
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,218
You don't need to know.
I'll figure it out.

301
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,545
- Joon.
- I have to hang up.

302
00:22:02,476 --> 00:22:04,578
CEO Min?

303
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:06,415
Joon, are you okay?

304
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:08,744
Your cough doesn't sound good.

305
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,336
It's okay, just a passing cold.

306
00:22:11,336 --> 00:22:14,178
Who was that on the phone?

307
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:17,625
Apparently, Hyuk is cleaning
the exterior of the building.

308
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,700
- What?
- What?

309
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,854
The exterior of the building?

310
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:23,239
I think I need to go
upstairs for a moment.

311
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,469
We were told to stay put.
Do you think it'll be okay?

312
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,467
Isn't cleaning the exterior
of the building a bit severe?

313
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:32,007
All right, we'll finish up here.
Go on upstairs.

314
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:34,146
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

315
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,715
Sorry.

316
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:37,906
Is the manager crazy?

317
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:42,096
What's he thinking putting a kid
with no experience out there?

318
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:44,195
Seriously now.

319
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:56,932
I feel queasy.

320
00:22:56,932 --> 00:23:00,631
I like land. I missed you.

321
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:06,241
Quit now if you can't do it.

322
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:08,050
Who said I can't do it?

323
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,528
But, how can you give
that dangerous job to a beginner?

324
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:13,339
What if there was an accident?

325
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:15,704
Do you think I enjoy
doing this to you people?

326
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:19,728
I have a son and daughter too.
Do you think I enjoy harassing you?

327
00:23:19,728 --> 00:23:21,627
The higher-ups are
ordering it. What can I do?

328
00:23:21,627 --> 00:23:23,876
Do I have any power?

329
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:26,270
So, can you all stop bothering me?

330
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,347
Just quit on your own.

331
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:31,488
If you two quit...

332
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:35,856
I'll put Mister Lee, Mister Kim, and
Madam Ahn back in their old places.

333
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:38,798
Don't hold out and make others suffer.

334
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:40,038
Think it over.

335
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,108
Get downstairs now!
I told you not to leave your work.

336
00:23:53,817 --> 00:23:55,858
What a load of crap.

337
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,758
<i>Do you trust your brother that much?</i>

338
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:06,035
Don't you know facilities management is
managed by management and administration?

339
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:08,344
The highest person there
is your older brother.

340
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:10,257
The higher-ups are
ordering it. What can I do?

341
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:11,353
Do I have any power?

342
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:21,153
Hyuk.

343
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:24,805
You were there?

344
00:24:29,722 --> 00:24:33,505
How could a father do that?

345
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,828
Is he only my son? It's his son too.

346
00:24:35,828 --> 00:24:37,396
How absurd.

347
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,230
Oh, my Hyuk!

348
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,650
Ta-da.

349
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:49,374
I rode a gondola.

350
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:53,586
At first, it was very scary.

351
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:57,768
After I was on it for five minutes,
I thought, "Oh, it's not bad."

352
00:24:57,768 --> 00:25:00,038
I was actually well-suited for it.

353
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:02,686
I'm actually into extreme things.

354
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:06,617
I really like bungee
jumping and skydiving.

355
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:13,487
So, let's not quit for them.

356
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:23,432
If we quit like they want us to,
how should I put it...

357
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:25,127
Um...

358
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:26,933
It would be shameful.

359
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:29,428
That's right! Also...

360
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:33,458
How should I put it? It's kind of...

361
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:37,238
It feels like we'd be giving into
something unjust, so you're angry?

362
00:25:37,238 --> 00:25:40,007
Yes, that's exactly it!

363
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,255
Joon, you always know how I feel.

364
00:25:42,255 --> 00:25:44,278
Oh, how unusual.

365
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:46,400
You have that kind
of strength too, Byun Hyuk?

366
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,628
What do you mean?

367
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:50,450
I'm someone who walked into
the prosecutor's office on my own.

368
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,559
You saw it too.

369
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,935
My spirit, courage, and passion.

370
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:57,324
I saw a bit of bluffing.

371
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:58,644
Hey now.

372
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:02,463
You can't talk of my sincere
passion for you like that.

373
00:26:04,317 --> 00:26:08,298
Because of you and for you,
I've come this far.

374
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:22,964
What did he say?
Because of that girl?

375
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:29,731
Oh, your face is red again.

376
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:35,701
Red? Red? Who is red?

377
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:38,865
I'm not red. Oh, it's hot.

378
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:45,329
Hey, I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

379
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:47,124
Oh yeah? You're hungry?

380
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:50,332
Then we should go. Let's go eat now.

381
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:51,433
What are you doing?

382
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:57,236
You're coughing? You really have a cold?

383
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:59,077
Who is that girl?

384
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:04,467
She's already close to him,
a girl like Pyunggang.

385
00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:06,894
It can't be.

386
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:11,670
<i>A protest? What complete nonsense.</i>

387
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,181
We just wanted to eat a meal.
How is that a protest?

388
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:17,736
They're just service
company contractors too.

389
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,006
Do they think they're
some high ranked people?

390
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,964
Let's not sit here.
Let's go up to eat lunch.

391
00:27:22,964 --> 00:27:24,409
Joon?

392
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,188
No thanks.

393
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:29,897
I don't want to cause problems and
put people in difficult positions.

394
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:32,152
Goodness.

395
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:39,904
Let's just finish our job.

396
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:44,909
I just can't understand it.

397
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:47,828
We have the meal tickets and
we only want to use them to eat.

398
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:49,378
What is so complicated?

399
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:50,731
What can we do?

400
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:54,385
Big corporations like this don't
hire cleaners like us directly.

401
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:55,455
Why?

402
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:59,855
Because of things like
insurance, benefits, retirement.

403
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:03,267
There's so much
to take care of for employees.

404
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:06,415
That's why they use contract
services for convenience.

405
00:28:06,415 --> 00:28:11,546
Then can they be hired by
Gangsu Group if they change their mind?

406
00:28:11,546 --> 00:28:14,238
If the company changes
its mind, then yes.

407
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:16,325
There wouldn't be a need
for a service contractor.

408
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:18,405
Then we could eat
in the employee cafeteria too?

409
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:22,867
Of course, if that's the company
policy, we could eat there.

410
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,749
Eureka.

411
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:28,079
These are all the forms
of discrimination that we don't see.

412
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,361
Though we're so used to it that
we don't even feel it anymore.

413
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:35,076
You're right.

414
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:37,950
Let's just buy lots of kimbap.

415
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,101
Oh, I'm hungry.

416
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:41,755
- Come on.
- Get up.

417
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:44,143
They can hire them directly.

418
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,194
If only the company decides to...

419
00:28:55,156 --> 00:28:56,479
Oh, Joon!

420
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,377
- Joon!
- What's wrong?

421
00:28:58,377 --> 00:28:59,452
Joon.

422
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,238
- Oh no!
- Joon!

423
00:29:11,238 --> 00:29:12,709
Joon!

424
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:16,834
No! Watch out!

425
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,646
Joon, what do we do?

426
00:29:18,646 --> 00:29:20,175
Joon!

427
00:29:21,953 --> 00:29:23,777
Are you okay, Joon?

428
00:29:23,777 --> 00:29:25,025
- Joon.
- Joon!

429
00:29:25,025 --> 00:29:26,269
Joon!

430
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:27,962
- Joon.
- Joon!

431
00:29:27,962 --> 00:29:29,307
Are you all right?

432
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:30,593
Joon!

433
00:29:30,593 --> 00:29:32,869
- Joon.
- Joon!

434
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,500
Say something!

Jae Hoon, there's a problem.

441
00:30:15,601 --> 00:30:17,717
What now? Did you cause a problem?

442
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:19,276
Joon passed out.

443
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,755
- Joon passed out!
- What?

444
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:23,355
- Over here.
- Okay.

445
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,747
She's okay, right?

446
00:30:39,747 --> 00:30:43,355
Are you her guardian? Go register.

447
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:44,613
Register?

448
00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:49,415
Where do I go to...

449
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:50,698
Over there.

450
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:51,895
Okay.

451
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:58,482
I was sent here from the ER.

452
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,355
Please fill this out.

453
00:31:00,355 --> 00:31:01,363

What? No, that's my name.

457
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:16,650
No, you need to write the patient's name.

458
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,708
Oh, is that right?
Sorry, I didn't know.

You don't know her personal information?

462
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:36,315
The thing is, it's my first time
filling out this kind of form.

463
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:37,364
What?

464
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,932
- Jae Hoon.
- I'll do it.

465
00:32:07,203 --> 00:32:08,291
Here you go.

466
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:13,852
Is she on any medication?

467
00:32:13,852 --> 00:32:14,868
No.

468
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:17,777
- Any allergies?
- No.

469
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:19,557
What's her blood type?

470
00:32:19,557 --> 00:32:20,736
Type O.

471
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,965
Do you want to do a CT?

472
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:25,291
- Use that to pay for everything.
- Okay.

473
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:27,762
Where's Joon?

474
00:32:29,054 --> 00:32:30,403
In the ER.

475
00:32:44,252 --> 00:32:47,229
Seeing that she has a fever,
it seems she has a slight cold.

476
00:32:47,229 --> 00:32:49,148
She also has overexertion.

477
00:32:49,148 --> 00:32:50,721
Overexertion?

478
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:54,161
There's nothing else particularly
wrong, so she can finish the IV

479
00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:56,378
then pick up medication.

480
00:32:56,378 --> 00:32:59,049
She must rest for things like this.

481
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:01,595
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

482
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:14,941
According to the cleaning manager...

483
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:18,950
the higher-ups ordered him to do it.

484
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:23,086
Was that person CEO Min
of the cleaning company?

485
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:27,291
I still don't understand it though.

486
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:28,712
Even so...

487
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:35,311
Why would CEO Min be so
harsh with me and Joon?

488
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:36,499
Is it possibly because of....

489
00:33:37,777 --> 00:33:39,846
that brick incident?

490
00:33:47,781 --> 00:33:49,849
Are you that slow?

491
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:52,031
Or are you just pretending?

492
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:57,519
Even if he disliked you and Joon,
he knows you're the chairman's son.

493
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,421
Would it make sense for CEO Min
to do that without anyone backing him?

494
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:05,651
Is the person backing CEO Min...

495
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:10,460
my older brother?

496
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:35,121
Do you think you can handle it?

497
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,561
Attempted murder?

498
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:55,766
Yes.

499
00:34:55,766 --> 00:35:00,106
But, it was never, ever
my intent to call the police.

500
00:35:00,106 --> 00:35:04,043
I didn't know that it was your brother,
the second son of Gangsu Group either.

501
00:35:05,038 --> 00:35:08,876
The second son of Gangsu Group
working in a construction site.

502
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:10,717
Who could imagine that?

503
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:16,885
You two have an amusing
relationship of bad fate.

504
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:19,780
Yes.

505
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,934
So, I wanted to resolve
the misunderstanding...

506
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:24,516
No need to worry over
one measly service employee.

507
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:31,342
Well, thanks to your injured
forehead, we managed to meet.

508
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:32,373
Ah.

509
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:35,489
That's an honor.

510
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:40,110
No matter what you need done
from now on, please use me.

511
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,413
Hangang Services doesn't
only provide cleaning.

512
00:35:42,413 --> 00:35:45,001
We are experts at cleaning up
any other pesky things.

513
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,112
For example?

514
00:35:49,173 --> 00:35:52,574
Anything you don't wish
to dirty your hands with.

515
00:35:52,574 --> 00:35:57,197
Something unclear or messy,
anything that's bothersome.

516
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:03,246
My goodness. It sounds like
you're talking about Hyuk.

517
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:05,313
It makes me feel awkward to hear it.

518
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:11,340
Whatever the case,
just give me your orders.

519
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,041
Please accept this drink.

520
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:49,233
Woo Sung.

521
00:37:15,387 --> 00:37:16,637
Thanks.

522
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:52,715
This is an employee application.

523
00:37:54,945 --> 00:37:57,657
There are open applications
coming up at the company for interns.

524
00:38:07,692 --> 00:38:10,413
I'm just frustrated seeing you like this.

525
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,266
Why suffer instead of going down
an easier, more comfortable path?

526
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:15,157
What's an easy and comfortable path?

527
00:38:17,135 --> 00:38:20,994
A career that you can
show off to others about?

528
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:24,974
Or a high salary?

529
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:26,713
Ask other people.

530
00:38:26,713 --> 00:38:29,679
Ask them which of us is right.

531
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,929
Don't be delusional that you're right.

532
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:37,409
In the end, people live
according to their beliefs.

533
00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:42,103
You continue to choose
to work hard labor jobs.

534
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:45,264
What are these beliefs of yours?

535
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,840
Get going.

536
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:55,478
I want to rest.

538
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:01,737
Hyuk.

539
00:40:07,963 --> 00:40:10,628
What are you doing here alone?

540
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:11,996
Nothing really.

541
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:16,197
How about you? How are you feeling?

542
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:18,655
I'm all right.

543
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:23,105
I went to the ER for a cold.

544
00:40:23,105 --> 00:40:24,166
How embarrassing.

545
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:28,751
It wasn't just a cold.
You had overexerted yourself too.

546
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:31,012
A cold and overexertion.

547
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,992
And you were down in the garbage
room working where the air was bad.

548
00:40:36,577 --> 00:40:37,811
If you think about it...

549
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:42,021
it's all my fault.

550
00:40:42,021 --> 00:40:45,213
Hey, why is that your fault?

551
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:48,452
It's CEO Min's fault
for abusing his power.

552
00:40:48,452 --> 00:40:50,429
Anyway, that makes it my fault.

553
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:53,052
- Hyuk.
- So, I was thinking, Joon...

554
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:54,472
I think that...

555
00:40:55,976 --> 00:40:57,711
I should quit.

556
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:02,552
What are you talking about?

557
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:05,483
You said we shouldn't quit.
You said so yourself.

558
00:41:05,483 --> 00:41:07,512
You said that it would be shameful.

559
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:09,159
That it was giving in to injustice.

560
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:14,577
If I quit, you, Mister Kim,
Mister Lee, and Madam Ahn...

561
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:17,980
they will all be okay, so...

562
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,378
What about your promise to your father?

563
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:24,001
He'll assume I can only go that far.

564
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:26,503
I was always that kind of son.

565
00:41:26,503 --> 00:41:28,442
It won't be anything new for him.

566
00:41:30,481 --> 00:41:31,565
Okay.

567
00:41:35,373 --> 00:41:38,958
Yeah, then quit.

568
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:44,987
Who can stop you if you
don't want to do it?

569
00:41:44,987 --> 00:41:47,090
However...

570
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:52,246
don't use me, Mister Kim,
Mister Lee, or Madam Ahn as excuses.

571
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:58,115
Whether you continue
to work or not, that is your choice.

572
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:02,201
I don't want to hear
that you did it because of us.

573
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:08,009
Honestly... it's just an excuse.

574
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:10,978
Isn't that right?

575
00:42:16,713 --> 00:42:19,108
I told you to get confident on your own.

576
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:25,967
Claiming your rights is part
of getting confident, Hyuk.

577
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:27,467
Claiming my rights?

578
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:31,367
Yes, your rights.

579
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:34,996
Someone is desperately
hoping that you will give up.

580
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,436
That's what I'm talking about.

581

<i>For example?</i>

582
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:45,521
Anything you don't wish
to dirty your hands with.

583
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:50,050
Something unclear or messy,
anything that's bothersome.

584
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:56,153
My goodness. It sounds like
you're talking about Hyuk.

585
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:58,206
It makes me feel awkward to hear it.

00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:21,483
Hey... hey.
What's with you suddenly?

587
00:43:26,402 --> 00:43:28,278
I'm just so ashamed.

588
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,809
I'm so ashamed in front of you.

589
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,701
Are you crying?

590
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:44,474
No need to cry over that.

591
00:43:44,474 --> 00:43:47,985
It's okay, all right? It's okay.

592
00:43:49,077 --> 00:43:50,485
Stop crying.

593
00:43:57,277 --> 00:43:58,592
Gosh.

594
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:01,659

Bye, then.

What was that?

607
00:45:51,637 --> 00:45:53,710
Oh, that scared me.

608
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,969
Did he move in next door?

609
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:58,809
Oh, how did he know where I lived?

610

Uh... excuse me.

00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:29,302
I was a bit sick yesterday,
so I went to the hospital.

00:47:29,302 --> 00:47:31,954
Stop being so tough.
That's enough now.

621
00:47:31,954 --> 00:47:34,547
I'll pay you for the work you did so far.

Sorry, but I can't do that.

I told you that you couldn't
leave work while on the job.

00:47:41,949 --> 00:47:44,945
It wasn't leaving on the job.
I had to go to the hospital.

That's your own personal problem.

627

You should quit

Don't be a nuisance to everyone.

629

Manager, you're being too harsh.

630
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:57,391
You're the one who is too harsh.

631
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:59,860
What are you planning
by staying around like this?

632

If you faint while on the job

633
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,121
are you going to ask
for worker's compensation?

00:48:05,121 --> 00:48:06,809
Ah.

Hangang Services hold any responsibility.

Mister Kim, do you want to get fired too?

643
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,722
- Seriously?
- What nonsense.

644
00:48:30,722 --> 00:48:32,530
- How ridiculous.
- Is he for real?

645
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,452
- He's the worst.
- For sure.

- Mister Lee.
- Stay put!

00:48:56,704 --> 00:49:00,775
If we don't work now and
just leave, what can you do about it?

656
00:49:00,775 --> 00:49:02,706
They will say the cleaning job is a mess.

657
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,922
The company employees
will complain loudly.

Can you re-sign
the contract, at that rate?

- No, you can't!

You're the one making
threats, Manager Jung.

664
00:49:18,983 --> 00:49:22,110
- When did I do that?
- You just did!

665
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,467
Why you people...

666
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:25,635

00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:30,798
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:32,936
- Let's go for it!
- Come on.

670
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:37,358
Act like a manager if you're the manager.

671

You think you're all that if
you're manager?

Are you talking to me?

681
00:50:07,653 --> 00:50:09,043
Let's talk later.

682
00:50:12,364 --> 00:50:13,472
What's with you?

683
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:15,413
I came to see you, CEO Min.

684
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,143

686
00:50:22,324 --> 00:50:26,123
I just had one thing
I wanted you to know.

00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,240
What?

688
00:50:34,302 --> 00:50:39,172
You won't be able to renew your
contract with Gangsu Group.

689
00:50:39,172 --> 00:50:40,192
What?

690
00:50:40,192 --> 00:50:42,092
I'll stop you from
renewing that contract.

00:50:44,414 --> 00:50:49,076
Gosh... what are going on about so
early in the morning, you punk?

692
00:50:49,076 --> 00:50:53,766
Hey, you've been tossed out by your
family, so how will you stop it?

693
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:55,876
You're dressed in this cleaner's uniform.

694
00:50:55,876 --> 00:50:58,751
You picked up money
from construction. What can you do?

695
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:01,541
Then who are trusting
to act so foolishly?

696
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:07,152
Your older brother
told me to stomp you out.

697
00:51:07,152 --> 00:51:08,192
Satisfied?

698
00:51:12,137 --> 00:51:15,440
Do you think you can handle it?

699
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:20,338
I'll have to handle it.

700
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:21,391

701
00:51:22,757 --> 00:51:23,826

00:51:35,556 --> 00:51:37,940
He'll handle it.

703

704
00:51:39,548 --> 00:51:41,217
Yes.

705
00:51:41,217 --> 00:51:43,726
There is a problem in the building
management, as well.

706
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:48,007
Byun Hyuk and someone else, Baek Joon,
have mobilized my company employees.

Should I take care
of it before it gets noisy?

711
00:52:00,554 --> 00:52:02,130
No.

712
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,291

00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:16,744
It seems like Hyuk
is determined for once.

716
00:52:16,744 --> 00:52:20,255
Leave him and let's see what he does.

717
00:52:20,255 --> 00:52:24,474
But, the CEO will be at
the sampling event tomorrow.

718
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,235
Not just the CEO,
but external parties too.

719
00:52:27,235 --> 00:52:29,757
There will be reporters with cameras.

720
00:52:29,757 --> 00:52:30,920
Will it be okay?

721
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,228
Hyuk says he will handle it.

722
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,027
Leave him alone to do what he wants.

723
00:52:42,228 --> 00:52:45,427
The event will be ruined and
Hyuk will be taken care of.

724
00:52:45,427 --> 00:52:47,487
Two birds with one stone, right?

725
00:52:56,327 --> 00:52:58,369
Just pretend you didn't know.

726
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:02,518
Since Hyuk will cause the problem,
you won't get in trouble.

727
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:15,103
Where have you been
all this time? The event is tomorrow.

728
00:53:15,103 --> 00:53:17,974
Will the event run smoothly?

729
00:53:17,974 --> 00:53:19,405
I'm sorry.

730
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:21,465
I'm sure he'll do well.

731
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:23,903
He has great personnel record.

732
00:53:23,903 --> 00:53:27,764
All of the projects he's
taken on have succeeded.

733
00:53:27,764 --> 00:53:32,605
Also, he wouldn't mess up
the first event he takes on here.

734
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:33,724
Isn't that right?

735
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,144
I will do my best, Director.

736
00:53:39,146 --> 00:53:40,512
You will have to.

737
00:53:41,742 --> 00:53:43,135
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

738
00:53:46,882 --> 00:53:48,757
Hey.

739
00:53:48,757 --> 00:53:53,226
You know how important this event is
to the Managing Director and team, right?

740
00:53:53,226 --> 00:53:55,525
There had better not be any problems.

741
00:54:06,936 --> 00:54:08,465
Come on. Hurry.

742
00:54:08,465 --> 00:54:11,083
- Everyone's here.
- Come on.

743
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:13,603
Hurry. Gather around.

744
00:54:13,603 --> 00:54:17,269
I'm going to go all the way this time.

746
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:25,934
Here you go.

747
00:54:25,934 --> 00:54:27,110
Thanks.

748
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:28,862
Let's go now.

749
00:54:28,862 --> 00:54:30,385
All right.

750
00:54:30,385 --> 00:54:31,706
Let's go.

751
00:54:31,706 --> 00:54:33,101
Hold on.

752
00:54:33,101 --> 00:54:36,271
You really don't have to do this.

753
00:54:36,271 --> 00:54:38,715
Are cleaning employees not human?

754
00:54:38,715 --> 00:54:42,067
Does it make sense that we
can't even get worker's compensation?

755
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:46,556
This happened because you fought
to get us cafeteria meal tickets.

756
00:54:46,556 --> 00:54:48,590
We wouldn't be humans
if we ignored that.

757
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,994
Yes, of course.

758
00:54:49,994 --> 00:54:53,186
It's time for their contract
renewal, so they can't ignore us.

759
00:54:53,186 --> 00:54:56,293
If we don't speak up now,
they won't blink an eye.

760
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,215
Yes, that's right.

761
00:54:58,215 --> 00:54:59,594
That's for certain.

762
00:54:59,594 --> 00:55:01,360
Wait, wait.

763
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,157
I'm very grateful that you are all
feeling the heartache and anger with me.

764
00:55:05,157 --> 00:55:07,121
Still, you don't have to do this.

765
00:55:07,121 --> 00:55:10,076
It's okay if I get fired,
but what if you all get fired?

766
00:55:10,076 --> 00:55:13,123
Joon, what happened to you...

767
00:55:13,123 --> 00:55:16,300
it could happen to
any of us at any time.

768
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,476
This isn't because of you,
so don't feel that way.

769
00:55:20,476 --> 00:55:21,487
Mister Kim.

770
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:23,762
I'll quit if they want to fire me.

771
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:25,862
I can find another job like this.

772
00:55:25,862 --> 00:55:28,858
If you step on me,
I may not be able to wiggle a lot

773
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,501
but I will move about a bit if I can!

774
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:33,090
- Sounds good!
- Yes.

775
00:55:34,255 --> 00:55:35,938
Let's go now!

776
00:55:35,938 --> 00:55:37,871
We need to show them!

777
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:39,195
You're all right.

778
00:55:42,148 --> 00:55:44,338
We need to show them.

779
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:45,757
Hyuk.

780
00:55:45,757 --> 00:55:51,208
But, this method... it's so old.

781
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:54,773
As you all know,
I personally know the CEO.

782
00:55:54,773 --> 00:55:58,878
A strike isn't the kind of thing
that will work on him.

783
00:55:58,878 --> 00:56:01,929
Really? Then what will work?

784
00:56:03,996 --> 00:56:05,398
A show.

785
00:56:05,398 --> 00:56:08,306
- A show?
- A show?

786
00:56:08,306 --> 00:56:09,931
A show?

787
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:12,121
Yes.

788
00:56:12,121 --> 00:56:14,153
A show.

789
00:56:14,153 --> 00:56:15,440
What kind of show?

790
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,420
What kind of show would we do?

791
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,123
Wow!

792
00:56:24,123 --> 00:56:25,242
I want this one.

793
00:56:25,242 --> 00:56:27,414
- Pink would suit you.
- How about this?

794
00:56:27,414 --> 00:56:29,177
That's sexy.

795
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,485

Stop right now.

00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:25,711
Stop what?

800
00:57:25,711 --> 00:57:28,822
Whatever you're planning
for tomorrow's sampling event.

801
00:57:28,822 --> 00:57:32,103
Wow, even you've heard about it already?

802
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:36,172
Do you know how important that
event is for the company?

803
00:57:36,172 --> 00:57:39,567
If it's the company you're
worried about, there's no need.

804
00:57:39,567 --> 00:57:42,719
I'm not going to ruin tomorrow's event.

805
00:57:45,193 --> 00:57:49,452
No, you'll never succeed,
no matter what you do.

You don't have to worry if you are.

813
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,619
Of course. Of course.

It's not too late even now.

You don't have to do it

You're going up against
your father and your brother.

Even if you stop now,
no one would say a thing.

That's why I have to do it.

819
00:59:10,387 --> 00:59:12,230
Because they are my father and brother.

820
00:59:13,961 --> 00:59:17,547
So, no one else can do this.

821
00:59:18,746 --> 00:59:20,295

- Let's go!
- Good luck.

What's this?

874
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:22,119
Did they invite performers?

875
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:23,255
I don't know.

01:04:37,755 --> 01:04:40,385
<i>is your sweet lips.</i>

895
01:04:40,385 --> 01:04:44,166
<i>The red sun shining for you</i>

896
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:47,463
<i>I only love you.</i>

897
01:04:47,463 --> 01:04:50,811
<i>I am burning hot.
Just look at me.</i>

898
01:04:50,811 --> 01:04:53,612
<i>I am in you.</i>

899
01:04:53,612 --> 01:04:57,260
<i>I like how sexy you are.
You're not shy at all.</i>

900
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,498
<i>I like how forward you are.</i>

901
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:00,737
I'm so sorry, CEO Byun.

902
01:05:00,737 --> 01:05:03,268
I'll stop them now. What are
you doing, Section Chief Kwon?

903
01:05:03,268 --> 01:05:06,804
Hey, hey, hey. Just leave them, okay?

904
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:12,202
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

905
01:05:12,202 --> 01:05:15,152
<i>My heart is on fire because of you.</i>

906
01:05:15,152 --> 01:05:18,686
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

907
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:22,244
<i>In front of love, I am melting.</i>

908
01:05:25,724 --> 01:05:29,101
<i>The way you smile
is worth a million.</i>

909
01:05:29,101 --> 01:05:32,119
<i>It makes me faint.</i>

910
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:35,559
<i>The best drink in this world</i>

911
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:37,905
<i>is your sweet lips.</i>

912
01:05:38,514 --> 01:05:41,409
He's better than I imagined.

913
01:05:41,409 --> 01:05:43,179
- Right, Sis?
- Yes, isn't he?

914
01:05:43,179 --> 01:05:45,943
Woohoo. He's pretty good.

915
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:47,717
My goodness.

916
01:05:47,717 --> 01:05:50,847
Who knew he had that kind of talent?

917
01:05:51,362 --> 01:05:54,297
<i>I like how sexy you are.
You're not shy at all.</i>

918
01:05:54,297 --> 01:05:58,190
<i>I like how forward you are.</i>

919
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:01,695
<i>You are so honest. </i>

920
01:06:01,695 --> 01:06:05,387
<i>I like that about you.</i>

921
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,141
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

922
01:06:10,141 --> 01:06:13,251
<i>My heart is on fire because of you.</i>

923
01:06:13,251 --> 01:06:15,128
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

924
01:06:15,193 --> 01:06:17,282
Why you punk...

925
01:06:17,282 --> 01:06:18,550
Come on.

926
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:23,338
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

927
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:26,318
<i>My heart is on fire because of you.</i>

928
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:29,847
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

929
01:06:29,847 --> 01:06:33,034
<i>In front of love, I am melting.</i>

930
01:06:40,965 --> 01:06:42,829
- Yes.
- Good job.

931
01:06:42,829 --> 01:06:44,045
Thank you. Thank you.

932
01:06:44,045 --> 01:06:47,903
We are Gangsu Food's cleaners
who are in charge of the hygiene.

933
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,998
We are here performing a congratulatory 
song for the new product.

934
01:06:50,998 --> 01:06:56,163
Please give a big round of applause
to the performance from our cleaners.

935
01:06:56,163 --> 01:07:00,226
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

936
01:07:04,434 --> 01:07:07,297
Father, I would've stopped him
if I had known in advance.

937
01:07:07,297 --> 01:07:09,534
I didn't know Hyuk would do
something so foolish.

938
01:07:09,534 --> 01:07:12,344
I'll make sure to discipline him.

939
01:07:12,344 --> 01:07:15,865
Everyone, Gangsu Foods is
a company that makes food.

940
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,945
Hygiene is a basic thing
when it comes to food.

941
01:07:18,945 --> 01:07:22,565
So, our cleaning employees are in the
building where you earn your livelihoods.

942
01:07:22,565 --> 01:07:27,436
They are always doing their
very best for Gangsu Foods.

943
01:07:37,876 --> 01:07:39,405
With that in mind...

944
01:07:40,396 --> 01:07:44,976
Gangsu Group cherishes
our cleaning employees.

945
01:07:46,065 --> 01:07:47,525
They are considerate of them.

946
01:07:52,655 --> 01:07:55,527
Therefore, CEO Byun Gang Su...

947
01:07:56,494 --> 01:08:00,826
has decided to not use external
contractors for cleaning services.

948
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,534
He will hire them directly.

949
01:08:02,534 --> 01:08:06,804
He decided to make that
announcement on this very day.

950
01:08:06,804 --> 01:08:08,342
What?

951
01:08:08,342 --> 01:08:10,059
Is that true?

952
01:08:10,059 --> 01:08:11,376
Hyuk didn't mention that.

953
01:08:11,376 --> 01:08:13,472
That doesn't make sense.

954
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,543
Hyuk.

955
01:08:17,578 --> 01:08:18,987
- What's going on?
- Hey.

956
01:08:18,987 --> 01:08:20,845
What's going on, Byun Hyuk?

957
01:08:20,845 --> 01:08:22,342
I've never heard that before.

958
01:08:22,342 --> 01:08:24,657
Is that true? Is it?

959
01:08:24,657 --> 01:08:26,890
- This never came up.
- He's not that kind of person.

960
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:28,997
A temporary employee
into a full-time employee?

961
01:08:28,997 --> 01:08:30,578
All of those employees?

962
01:08:30,578 --> 01:08:31,905
Is it true?

963
01:08:31,905 --> 01:08:33,609
- Really?
- Hold on.

964
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,645
CEO Byun Gang Su.

965
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:41,226
I truly thank you for this
very meaningful decision.

966
01:08:41,226 --> 01:08:43,717
He never mentioned that.

967
01:08:43,717 --> 01:08:45,323
- It must be true.
- Really? Oh my.

968
01:08:45,323 --> 01:08:46,752
CEO Byun Gang Su!

969
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:49,996
Thank you!

970
01:08:49,996 --> 01:08:53,372
Give him a round of applause!

971
01:08:53,372 --> 01:08:54,729
Woo!

972
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:00,720
That little punk.

973
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,645
- CEO!
- Is that true?

974
01:09:02,645 --> 01:09:04,417
Please give us a comment.

975
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:06,278
Just one comment.

976
01:09:06,278 --> 01:09:08,046
Did you know about this?

977
01:09:08,046 --> 01:09:09,917
Hyuk, you little rascal.

978
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:17,608
Hyuk, why did you do that?

979
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:19,210
Why did you do it?

980
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:22,328
<i>It was because of you.</i>

981
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,060
<i>Like paint that spreads
in a container of water...</i>

982
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:31,238
<i>very gradually and gracefully...</i>

983
01:09:31,238 --> 01:09:36,690
<i>you changed my heart into your color.</i>

984
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:39,462
<i>I was changed into your color.</i>

985
01:09:39,462 --> 01:09:42,654
<i>I could not return to colorlessness.</i>

986
01:09:42,654 --> 01:09:44,690
<i>And like that...</i>

987
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:50,072
<i>you changed the color
of my heart into your color.</i>

988
01:09:53,872 --> 01:09:55,113
Hyuk.

989
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:57,663
Joon.
