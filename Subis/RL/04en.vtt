<i>[Appearance by Gangsu Group's
Second Son, Byun Hyuk]</i>

6
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:35,590
Why have you suddenly shown up
after staying away for so long?

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,420
Do you acknowledge the assault?

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,082
Did you sexually harass
the flight attendant?

9
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:41,011
Did you lobby the prosecutors
to bury the case?

10
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:42,320
<i>Where have you been?</i>

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,948
<i>- Did Gangsu Group settle with her?</i>
- Oh!

12
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:48,033
Young... young man?

13
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:50,890
Byun?

14
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,484
Please give us one comment.

15
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:04,572
Everything... was due to my carelessness.

16
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,986
How do you feel right now?

17
00:01:18,998 --> 00:01:22,307
Reporters, you're all working so hard.

18
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:24,742
Why don't we do photo shoot?

19
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:26,536
- Huh?
- Photo shoot?

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,819
Is this etiquette?

21
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:39,799
That will be all then. Work hard.

22
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,897
How are you feeling right now?

23
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:51,405
Excuse me.

<i>Gangsu Group's Byun Hyuk, whose
whereabouts have been unknown</i>

25

<i>[Prosecutor Hwang Myung Soo]
Prosecutors have been under scrutiny...</i>

27
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:08,953
Why didn't he say anything?

28
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:17,580
Joon, to tell you the truth...

29
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:20,402
yesterday night...

30
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:28,354
<i>Regarding the reporter's questions on
whether the surrender was preplanned</i>

31
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:31,865
<i>Gangsu Group has yet
to give an official answer.</i>

32
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:34,443
<i>- Hold on, President.
- The CEO is inside, right?</i>

33
00:02:34,443 --> 00:02:35,734
<i>- You can't do this.
- Move!</i>

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,556
Gang Su.

35
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:42,234
What is with this chaos?

36
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:44,062
Why is Hyuk doing this?

37
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:46,818
Is this something you planned?

38
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:49,358
<i>Whenever there was a scandal,
the case was concealed.</i>

39
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:52,139
<i>The custom of the rich to avoid
punishment was broken.</i>

40
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:56,137
Do you know how much
the stock is falling?

41
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:58,664
You should've told us
in advance if this was the plan.

42
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:02,127
Do you want to see
our stock hit rock bottom?

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,859
<i>According to Monk Chung Woong,
he says our Hyuk will become great.</i>

44
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,598
He will do something great
and raise up our company.

45
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,705
What good is it to be born
with a great fortune?

46
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:17,048
He needs wings.

47
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:21,495
So, give our Hyuk a chance too.

48
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:23,365
<i>Even if you don't favor him...</i>

49
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:26,800
<i>isn't it only right for a parent
to give their child wings?</i>

50
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:30,223
Gosh, this is frustrating.

51
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:31,943
What are you going to do now?

52
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:35,646
Gang Su, can't you hear us?

53
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,270
Yes, it's Byun Gang Su.

54
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,656
No, we agreed to cover this up
before it got to charged...

55
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:57,925
We agreed to cover this all up.

56
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:59,536
You stab me in the back like this?

57
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:10,486
How can you turn this
upside down in less than an hour?

58
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:14,901
Are you set out on screwing me over?

59
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:16,584
Why would I do that, Prosecutor Hwang?

60
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:19,502
He went in there all on his own.

61
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:23,045
Now, I realize that you're not in
the loop within your company at all.

62
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:25,545
How will you ever do
anything great, at this rate?

63
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:31,535
Now that things worked out this way,
please investigate and punish him.

64
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:33,012
There's no need to be lenient.

65
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:34,891
Are you telling me how to do my job?

66
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,031
Are you telling me how to do my job?

67
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:48,283
I will no longer discuss
this matter with you.

68
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:10,375
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:15,514
Hello. Good morning.

70
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,033
Hello.

71
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,500
Manager Park, are you enjoying it?

72
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,930
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

73
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,620
Hey, did you see the news?

74
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,805
He turned himself in.

75
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:25,353
Yes, that troublemaker.

76
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:28,052
Look at that face.
He looks girl crazy.

77
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:30,913
- Yes, a pervert.
- With those eyes.

78
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:36,074
To tell you the truth,
Byun Hyuk came to my place last night.

79
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:44,475
I thought a money
settlement was enough.

80
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,677
Now, I know it was very hasty.

81
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,036
I am sincerely sorry.

82
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:00,372
Hyuk?

83
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,872
He says he got his act
together thanks to you.

84
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:07,033
He says that Joon, that you,
made him into a human being.

85
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:12,875
What's going to happen now?

86
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,644
What do you think?

87
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:16,665
He'll go to jail.

88
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,103
Oh, what will he do?

89
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:21,319
Won't it be worse
because he was on the run?

90
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,987
What will he do?
It's getting cold too.

91
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:26,942
<i>He got his act together because of me?</i>

92
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:29,458
<i>He didn't turn himself in
because of me, did he?</i>

93
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,687
<i>That's nonsense.
What's going to happen to Hyuk?</i>

94
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:36,968
<i>Hey, hey. Why am I worrying about him?</i>

95
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:41,807
He is a third generation rich guy.

96
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:44,788
His dad is the CEO of the group,
so he wouldn't do nothing.

97
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:48,329
He'll use money, or lawyers
will get him off on probation.

98
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:50,269
As they always do.

99
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:51,600
Isn't that right?

100
00:07:05,944 --> 00:07:07,300
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,629
Sorry, sorry.

102
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:14,959
Shouldn't you have been
in control of this?

103
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,396
You should've reported Hyuk's
movements to me, at least.

104
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:25,139
I had no idea that Hyuk
would suddenly do something like that.

105
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,588
I'm very sorry.

106
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:30,619
Who is this third party person
who is keeping Hyuk?

107
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:34,869
What is this?
Why do you have so many secrets?

108
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,458
Section Chief Kwon.

109
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,031
Are you and Hyuk up
to something I don't know about?

110
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:45,403
Up to something?

111
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:46,752
What do you mean?

112
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:49,136
He's never acted on his own like that.

113
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:53,495
Now, suddenly he is.
I'm just shocked.

114
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:55,716
Is something going on
with you two that I don't know?

115
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:04,649
I had a friend
who was able to let Hyuk stay.

116
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,684
My friend doesn't even know who Hyuk is.

117
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:08,725
It's irrelevant to this incident.

118
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:10,194
I trust you, Section Chief Kwon.

119
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:12,995
You know what I mean, right?

120
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,894
Yes.

121
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:21,732
Section Chief Kwon.

122
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,300
Do you trust me?

123
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:26,821
<i>Section Chief.</i>

124
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:29,254
<i>I traced where the video was leaked from.</i>

125
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:31,514
<i>They were trying to make
it look like a foreign IP.</i>

126
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:34,034
<i>But, you know me.
I found out where it came from.</i>

127
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:36,907
It was the Chief of Management's
office on the eighth floor.

128
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:50,332
Of course, I trust you.

129
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:04,594
<i>Once everything goes well with Hyuk,
I'll send you to Strategic Management.</i>

130
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:08,405
We can't let you go
to waste forever, right?

131
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:10,817
What do you mean by that?

132
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:14,812
Let him take responsibility for
the trouble he caused.

133
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,736
Prosecutor. Aren't you
going to investigate me?

134
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:45,784
You scared me!

135
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:47,154
Just stay put, would you?

136
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,734
Waiting to get hit
is harder than getting hit.

137
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:51,634
You're taking your time with it.

138
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:54,633
Taking my time? Who is?

139
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,335
You'd better watch your mouth.

140
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:59,856
Do you think a prosecutorial
investigation happens that quickly?

141
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:03,232
Aren't you going to handcuff me?

142
00:10:03,232 --> 00:10:05,708
- What?
- I'm going jail, right?

143
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,341
How large are the rooms?
I don't want to be alone.

144
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,729
Can you put me in a room
with lots of people?

145
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:12,573
I can't stand being bored.

146
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:23,261
Oh, my friend.

147
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:27,985
Hey, let's go.

148
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,130
I don't think anyone is here.
You can let go and talk.

149
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:43,221
His older brother said
to leave him a wanted man.

150
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:45,510
The younger brother shows up
here to be investigated.

151
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,712
One and then the other.

152
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,121
Are you guys playing me? Are you?

153
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:52,614
I thought you might misunderstand
and that's why I'm here.

154
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:54,481
It's not like that.
Just formally charge him.

155
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:56,644
Hey, this place has so many...

156
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:00,857
This place many people
being paid off by Gangsu.

157
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:04,618
We need to get our stories straight
or we'll get all mixed up.

158
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:11,041
Hyuk is ignoring the CEO
and doing this on his own.

159
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,452
The company has decided
to take their hands off too.

160
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:14,885
You're sure about that?

161
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:20,306
Fine, then I'll go by
the book from now on.

162
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:23,746
So, don't tell me to give back
what I've received so far.

163
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,390
Jae Hoon!

164
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,201
You really are the only person
who comes running for me.

165
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:57,851
What were you thinking when you did this?

166
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,900
Did you see?

167
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,173
I looked cool when I turned myself in.

168
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:02,611
What did Joon say? Huh?

169
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:04,722
Is that something you
should be asking now?

170
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:06,573
I don't know.

171
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:09,203
I felt bad hiding and
seeing Joon like that.

172
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:11,270
Hearing that I avoid
responsibility because of  money.

173
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,299
"Rich are innocent, poor are guilty."

174
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,067
It was embarrassing to hear.

175
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,811
A man would take
responsibility, so I came in.

176
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:19,880
Do you have a plan?

177
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,342
No, I don't.

178
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:25,842
What do I do now, friend?

179
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,881
What else?

180
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,144
Go through the investigation.

181
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:36,807
Let's start now. Sit down.

182
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:37,850
Jae Hoon, please...

183
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,897
Do well, then.

184
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:40,240
Jae Hoon, please!

185
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,859
Don't leave me alone.

186
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,337
I'm scared.

187
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:49,707
Please leave now.

188
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:52,471
Only lawyers are allowed in here.

189
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,693
You heard that, right?
I have to leave.

190
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:56,828
Jae Hoon!

191
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:08,505
Hello, where have you come from?

192
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,535
You must be Prosecutor Hwang Myung Soo.

193
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:13,075
We're Byun Hyuk's lawyers.

194
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,688
Lawyers?

195
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:19,282
Wait. Who hired you?

196
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:22,452
CEO Byun Gang Su
called our law firm himself.

197
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,455
Father?

198
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,524
You wanted to go by the book
and now there are five lawyers?

199
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:44,596
What is the play here?

200
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,746
<i>[Suspect's Statement]</i>
The tragedy started with Chae Ri.

201
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:06,136
<i>I was traumatized after
she stood me up in Bali.</i>

202
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,225
I had three whiskeys.

203
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:09,629
You already mentioned that.

204
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:11,899
Did I tell you I hadn't eaten at all.

205
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,419
That isn't important.

206
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,246
Why isn't that important?

207
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:18,640
Those are circumstances leading to
why I was so dizzy that day.

208
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,311
It is important.

209
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:26,510
Anyway, the moment I stood up,
the plane started to shake.

210
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,303
Once it started to shake,
I wanted to hold onto something and...

211
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,984
That was the flight attendant's chest?

212
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:32,081
Yes, that's right.

213
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,686
Why did you hit the person
who tried to stop you?

214
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:36,856
That was an accident that
occurred while trying not to fall.

215
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:39,721
That was the first time I had ever
encountered turbulence.

216
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:42,328
The video doesn't show
that much turbulence.

217
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:45,087
The sexual assault looks like
it was purposeful, as well.

218
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:50,346
Hey, I feel very wronged if you
judge purely on the video.

219
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:53,557
Then... do you have a witness?

220
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,116
Not really a witness.

221
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:01,807
I do have a relationship
with that flight attendant.

222
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:05,206
The flight attendant...
as in the victim?

223
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:06,914
We didn't know each other before.

224
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:09,308
It was a strange coincidence
that we ran into each other.

225
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,918
The point is...

226
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:15,636
I made a sincere apology to her.
Then she accepted my apology.

227
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:18,147
Are you saying you settled?

228
00:15:18,147 --> 00:15:23,057
We did have a type of settlement.

229
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:25,895
If there is a settlement, then those
are extenuating circumstances.

230
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:27,587
There was a settlement contract.

231
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:30,937
However, there was an accident
and Yeon Hee ripped it up.

232
00:15:30,937 --> 00:15:33,167
What kind of accident?

233
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,208
Honestly, I accidentally
grabbed her chest again.

234
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,063
- Oh no!
- No!

235
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,947
You're a repeat offender!

236
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,693
It's not like that.

237
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,823
Let go of me.

238
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:48,003
Prosecutor, my father told me
not to come in, to stay hidden.

239
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:50,390
- No!
- Grab him.

240
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,760
What in the world!

241
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,772
You should not speak
so carelessly to a prosecutor.

242
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:56,849
Are you trying to make me
charge CEO Byun too?

243
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:59,570
We would like to exercise
his right to remain silent now.

244
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,000
That makes me look bad.

245
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,471
I want to explain it all.

246
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:05,046
He told me not to go in, but to hide.

247
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:06,961
- He said to hide!
- No!

248
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:08,181
Stop! Stop!

249
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,876
What are you going to do now?

250
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:16,081
What am I supposed to do?

251
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:17,981
There are so many eyes watching.

252
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:20,039
I have to pretend to do
a proper investigation.

253
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,770
Make sure you explain
everything to CEO Byun.

254
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:43,451
Oh my goodness.

255
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,779
What's this?

256
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:52,554
I need the restroom.

257
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,058
<i>A witness interview?</i>

258
00:16:55,058 --> 00:16:57,975
I just got a call from the prosecutor.

259
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,366
He wants me to come tomorrow morning.

260
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:02,154
What should I do?

261
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,537
I think I'm a little scared, Joon.

262
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:47,597
You need go in for questioning.

263
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:48,705
Questioning?

264
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,010
Okay.

265
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:06,442
Yeon Hee!

266
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:10,703
What brings you here?

267
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:12,905
I'm here as a witness.

268
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:16,695
Witness?

269
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:20,457
I'll tell them exactly
what happened that day.

270
00:19:20,457 --> 00:19:21,519
Bye now.

271
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:53,279
The victim is done talking.

272
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,832
What did she say?

273
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:57,859
Yeon Hee will sue me, right?

274
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:59,269
Is it over now?

275
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:03,270
All that's left is me going to jail?

276
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,192
We'll have to see what
Prosecutor Hwang will do.

277
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:09,182
I think things will work out though.

278
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:12,329
How?

279
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:15,423
She said it was an accident
from severe turbulence.

280
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,711
She told them that the video
wasn't quite right.

281
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:19,182
That was her statement.

282
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:23,501
Yeon Hee said that?
She really said that?

283
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:25,959
Until we know what
Hankook Air's official position is...

284
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,292
we can't feel completely safe.

285
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,741
You can go home for now.

286
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:33,162
Awesome. For real? Really?

287
00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:35,635
Let's go now.
The CEO is waiting.

288
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:36,705
Wait!

289
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:43,176
Don't ever tell Joon that there
were five lawyers here.

290
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,178
What?

291
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:47,696
I worked so hard in order
to reveal the truth.

292
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:50,916
I wasn't afraid of any punishment
and didn't hide anything.

293
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,248
I was sincere in my investigation.

294
00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:57,195
You have to tell Joon.
I'm asking you, Jae Hoon.

295
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:03,140
Did you really come here
because of Joon?

296
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,162
Just to look good to Joon?

297
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:07,789
How many times do I
have to tell you that I did?

298
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:10,696
The company turned
upside down because of you.

299
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:12,971
And you did this
reckless thing over a girl?

300
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,830
She's not just a girl. It's Joon.

301
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,675
My life is divided into
"Before Joon" and "After Joon."

302
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:01,000
Are you finished? How did it go?

303
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,402
What did your father,
Byun Gang Su, do to settle this case?

304
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:04,644
Where are you headed now?

305
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:06,029
Please give us a comment!

306
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,224
One comment, please.

307
00:22:14,423 --> 00:22:17,273
Joon!

308
00:22:18,635 --> 00:22:19,806
Joon!

309
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:23,811
Joon!

310
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,068
Joon!

311
00:22:35,913 --> 00:22:37,071
<i>Move.</i>

312
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:39,902
Joon!

313
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,252
Joon... what is this?

314
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:46,394
Who are you people? Let me go!

315
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:50,009
Let go of me!

316
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,876
- Let go!
- It's the CEO's orders.

317
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:53,023
Don't rebel, just go.

318
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:54,922
No, I'm going to Joon. Joon!

319
00:22:54,922 --> 00:22:57,441
Yes, Joon! Joon!

320
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:59,080
Joon!

321
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,632
Don't take pictures... Joon!

322
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,902
Don't take pictures. Joon!

323
00:23:02,902 --> 00:23:04,688
You saw me, right? Joon?

324
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:05,770
Joon!

325
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:11,616
Joon!

326
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:15,422
Joon!

327
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,750
Joon!

328
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,512
Joon... Joon!

329
00:23:23,424 --> 00:23:24,962
Joon! Stop the car.

330
00:23:24,962 --> 00:23:26,601
Stop the car.

331
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:30,493
Joon... Joon!

332
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,592
Joon!

333
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,701
What's going to happen to Hyuk?

334
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:39,148
It worked out well, thanks to you.

335
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:43,990
If he gets dragged off like that,
won't he get beaten up by his father?

336
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,895
That's something Hyuk has to endure.

337
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,628
That's the world he lives in.

338
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,261
You're right.

339
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:58,058
Hyuk's just going back 
to the world he's originally from.

340
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:01,299
You're not worried about him, are you?

341
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,438
Why would I worry about
a third generation rich guy?

342
00:24:03,438 --> 00:24:04,608
Then why are you here?

343
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,438
- Joon!
- Hi.

344
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:08,430
- Let's go now.
- Yeah, let's go.

345
00:24:13,212 --> 00:24:16,119
Why would I worry
about him? How funny.

346
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,406
Huh? What do you mean?

347
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:20,020
It's nothing.
It was hard today, wasn't it?

348
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,223
It was no joke.

349
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:49,318
Why did someone like you show up?

350
00:24:49,318 --> 00:24:50,957
Why did you show up?

351
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:54,486
Why did you destroy everything? Why?

352
00:24:54,486 --> 00:24:56,483
Destroy?

353
00:24:56,483 --> 00:24:57,894
I did?

354
00:24:57,894 --> 00:24:59,723
I'm asking you this favor.

355
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:02,753
Please return to the world you came from.

356
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:04,943
Stop making things hard
for so many people.

357
00:25:04,943 --> 00:25:07,022
Please just get lost!

358
00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:30,740
<i>I will go to you.</i>

359
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,710
<i>I want to become a flower.</i>

360
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,759
<i>I want to become someone
you do not forget.</i>

361
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,510
<i>The one and only glance.</i>

362
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:48,489
Joon!

363
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:51,703
Joon! Stop the car!

364
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:53,585
Joon... Joon!

365
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:08,344
Live well, third generation rich guy.

366
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:31,586
So, the second son of Gangsu Group?

367
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:34,155
CEO Byun Gang Su's son, Byun Hyuk.

368
00:26:34,155 --> 00:26:37,501
The kid who carried bricks with us
and ate rice stew with us?

369
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:39,385
It's that Mister Byun?

370
00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:42,219
You must be so traumatized 
that your eyes are messed up.

371
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:45,248
You saw his face on the news!

372
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:49,667
It's that Mister Byun who threw
the brick at CEO Min.

373
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,578
What? The dandelion seeds were what?

374
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,977
Seriously, how absurd.

375
00:26:54,977 --> 00:26:57,567
Joon, you shouldn't
have done that either.

376
00:26:57,567 --> 00:27:01,707
I was good to you because you're
young and working in a place like that.

377
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:04,248
Yet, you sit there
and fool all of your elders?

378
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:07,231
I'm sorry.

379
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:10,928
Stop it! Joon would never
do that with bad intentions.

380
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:13,087
She must've had
her reasons for doing it.

381
00:27:13,087 --> 00:27:17,500
Well, Madam Ahn isn't wrong
about any of this.

382
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,608
If we knew he had
the support of that CEO father

383
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:23,647
we wouldn't have cared if he got
dragged off to the police station or not.

384
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:25,041
Isn't that right?

385
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:27,683
Because we took his side,
we all got fired.

386
00:27:27,683 --> 00:27:30,307
Look at us now.
What are we doing?

387
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:33,596
We shouldn't be doing this?

388
00:27:33,596 --> 00:27:37,175
Let's go find CEO Byun Gang Su.

389
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:39,159
Wh... what?

390
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,711
Well, this happened because
we were trying to save his son.

391
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:44,940
He should give us a reward.

392
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,665
Let's go. Joon, lead the way.

393
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,768
Ki Sub, let's go
get money for our losses.

394
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,385
Let's get going. Hurry.

395
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:52,540
Hurry up.

396
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,942
What should I do?
I don't know where they live.

397
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:05,527
Who in this country doesn't know
where CEO Byun Gang Su lives?

398
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:06,738
Let's go.

399
00:28:09,663 --> 00:28:10,820
Mister.

400
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:14,923
Oh no. What do we do?

401
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:18,874
Let me go, seriously.

402
00:28:18,874 --> 00:28:20,933
It hurts. Let go.

403
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,704
I'm sorry.

404
00:28:46,616 --> 00:28:48,520
You did well.

405
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,553
Pardon me?

406
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:54,663
If that's how you want to live,
then that's how you should live.

407
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:58,317
Thank you for sending me the lawyers.

408
00:28:58,317 --> 00:29:00,792
I didn't do it to save you.

409
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:03,384
I did it to save the company.

410
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:06,573
Yes, of course. The company comes first.

411
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:09,578
Soon, you will be cleared of all charges.

412
00:29:09,578 --> 00:29:12,571
You can live the way you want now.

413
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:13,953
Thank you, Father.

414
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:17,594
- You can go now.
- Yes, I will.

415
00:29:25,115 --> 00:29:26,579
Where do you think you're going?

416
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:30,740
You said I could go.

417
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,446
I meant get out.

418
00:29:37,446 --> 00:29:38,461
What?

419
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:41,777
If you've decided to live
on your own, by your own will...

420
00:29:41,777 --> 00:29:43,490
you should move out.

421
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:49,570
What do you mean by that?

422
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,211
You must have prepared for the
consequences of going against my word.

423
00:29:53,211 --> 00:29:57,392
You won't be getting any help
or support from me at all.

424
00:29:57,392 --> 00:29:59,880
Don't live as Byun Gang Su's son.

425
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,826
See how long you can survive
and live however you want.

426
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:06,541
Father, you're not
kicking me out, are you?

427
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,823
That's right. I am kicking you out.

428
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:11,875
Father, I was just released
by the prosecutors.

429
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,397
Isn't it wrong to kick me out like this?

430
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:18,047
Yes, it is wrong to kick
you out like this.

431
00:30:19,757 --> 00:30:21,895
Leave behind everything I've given you.

432
00:30:21,895 --> 00:30:24,568
All your clothes,
your watch, and shoes...

433
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:27,678
Everything on your body... all of it!

434
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:28,849
What?

435
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,965
Strip this punk.

436
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:32,746
- Right now!
- Yes.

437
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:35,605
Father! Hey, let go.
Don't do it.

438
00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:37,549
Don't touch me.
Mom, save me!

439
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:40,357
Father, Father! This isn't right.

440
00:30:40,357 --> 00:30:41,674
<i>Father!</i>

441
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:44,038
<i>Get out now!</i>

442
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,940
Father!

443
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,607
Mom, this isn't right. This isn't right.

444
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:13,038
Anyone who gives him any clothes
will be kicked out of my home.

445
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:28,217
Father, Mom! This is wrong.

446
00:31:31,618 --> 00:31:36,028
How... can... this... be?

447
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,778
Mom! Please save me.

448
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:51,308
Save me.

449
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:54,432
This is a crime... a crime!

450
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:56,903
Young Master, where are you?

451
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,191
Mister?

452
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:04,637
- Young Master.
- Yes?

453
00:32:04,637 --> 00:32:06,234
Take this, at least.

454
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:15,827
That is all I can give you.

455
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,154
This is better than nothing. Thank you.

456
00:32:21,616 --> 00:32:25,557
How much longer do I have to wait?

457
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:27,684
5 minutes or 10 minutes?

458
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:32,096
Will my father have cooled down by then?

459
00:32:32,096 --> 00:32:35,257
- Within five minutes...
- Yes?

460
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:40,316
You must get out of here or the CEO
will shoot you with a crossbow.

461
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,108
Young Master.

462
00:32:48,108 --> 00:32:51,267
I'm sorry I could not protect you.

463
00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:19,021
<i>That day, I was thrown out
into a world I did not know.</i>

464
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:25,162
<i>I thought it was like a brief vacation.</i>

465
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:27,721
<i>I had no idea at the time.</i>

466
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:29,829
<i>Once you break out of "The Matrix"...</i>

467
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,819
<i>you cannot return.</i>

468
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:36,671
<i>Once you swallow the red pill...</i>

469
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:38,820
<i>you can never return.</i>

470
00:33:57,866 --> 00:33:59,650
Honey!

471
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,700
Take it off!

472
00:34:11,657 --> 00:34:13,896
How many times
have we walked in circles?

473
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:15,166
Is this the right place?

474
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,728
Hold on. This is right.

475
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,704
Let's see here.

476
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:23,563
My eyes aren't very good,
so I can't tell at all.

477
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:27,481
Yeah, we need someone young
to lead the way here.

478
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:29,561
I'll go ahead and look around.

479
00:34:30,724 --> 00:34:32,530
Okay.

480
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,027
Wow, the houses sure are nice.

481
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:40,059
Where does one house start and end?

482
00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:03,907
Ah... ah!

483
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:13,789
Oh, what do I do?

484
00:35:15,202 --> 00:35:16,766
Oh my goodness!

485
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:20,170
Why? What is it?

486
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,771
- What? What?
- Over there.

487
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:24,027
Over there. Look, look.

488
00:35:24,027 --> 00:35:26,420
What? Look at that pervert punk!

489
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,367
That bastard. It's the middle of the day!

490
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,577
Hey, you pervert!

491
00:35:30,577 --> 00:35:31,702
- Get him!
- Stop!

492
00:35:31,702 --> 00:35:33,563
That's not it.

493
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:36,539
- Hey, pervert.
- Get him!

494
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:37,864
Wait. Hold on!

495
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:40,251
Stop following me. Stop!

496
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,757
- Stop running!
- Don't follow me!

497
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:43,918
Wait!

498
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,869
- Don't follow me.
- That's not it, everyone.

499
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:47,202
Wait!

500
00:35:47,202 --> 00:35:49,030
- Stop following me.
- Stop right there!

501
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:54,938
Pervert!

502
00:35:54,938 --> 00:35:56,672
Pervert, stop right there!

503
00:35:56,672 --> 00:35:58,952
Hey, pervert!

504
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:00,998
- Pervert!
- Stop!

505
00:36:00,998 --> 00:36:02,492
You pervert creep!

506
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:04,338
- Get him.
- Stop!

507
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,818
Go get him!

508
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,878
You punk. We got you, pervert.

509
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:36,885
Mister.

510
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:38,833
Huh?

511
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:41,043
Byun... Mister Byun.

512
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:43,193
- Byun?
- Young man?

513
00:37:01,643 --> 00:37:03,693
Oh my goodness.

514
00:37:03,693 --> 00:37:05,501
Even so...

515
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:09,164
how could he kick you out without
even a pair of underwear?

516
00:37:09,164 --> 00:37:12,655
Were you a child
they got off the streets?

517
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:17,273
Or are you an illegitimate child?

518
00:37:17,273 --> 00:37:20,780
We don't have any
birth secrets in our family.

519
00:37:25,338 --> 00:37:27,753
I bought some medication.
Put it on.

520
00:37:27,753 --> 00:37:28,864
Thank you.

521
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,268
Joon, could you possibly...

522
00:37:38,237 --> 00:37:40,367
not look at me?

523
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:44,829
Ah, yes. Okay.

524
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:50,228
So, what brings you all by?

525
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:52,958
Oh, yeah. You and the CEO...

526
00:37:54,157 --> 00:37:55,257
What?

527
00:37:58,748 --> 00:38:01,556
Ah, well we just happened to be...

528
00:38:02,498 --> 00:38:03,842
There goes the money.

529
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:09,481
Money?

530
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:15,157
Why don't we go
buy some clothes for now?

531
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:16,438
Yes, let's do that.

532
00:38:28,978 --> 00:38:31,925
Oh, here. Take these.

533
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:34,101
- Put on the underwear first.
- Thank you.

534
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:35,773
I bought something for you too, Mi Yeon.

535
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:38,128
That's not going to fit me.

536
00:38:38,128 --> 00:38:39,255
I'll keep it.

537
00:38:39,255 --> 00:38:41,302
Oh, there it is. Here.

538
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:43,175
Choose something.
2,000 won to 10,000 won.

539
00:38:43,175 --> 00:38:45,619
Choose something,
Miss Kyung and Miss Park.

540
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:47,376
- Make a choice.
- How's this?

541
00:38:47,376 --> 00:38:49,661
- Hm...
- How's this then?

542
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,405
This kind of pattern
doesn't suit my style.

543
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:54,867
Isn't there something
more intellectual or elegant?

544
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:56,693
How is this?

545
00:38:56,693 --> 00:39:01,340
Isn't there something more monochrome,
trendy, and sporty in design?

546
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,702
- What are you saying?
- What?

547
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:04,880
Hey, you're not
in a position to be picky.

548
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,387
This guy is picky.

549
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:08,170
Come on inside then.

550
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,556
We have lots of elegance inside.

551
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:11,097
- Come on in.
- Oh, really?

552
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:14,260
What's wrong with these?

553
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:28,735
What do you think?

554
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:30,806
It's great, right?
There's a good feeling.

555
00:39:30,806 --> 00:39:34,443
This is monochrome and sporty?

556
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:38,106
2017 intellectual trendy fashion.

557
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:40,726
As long as you like it...

558
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:43,007
I really like it a lot.

559
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:50,168
No...

560
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,349
I just can't.

561
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:57,434
Joon understands fashion.

562
00:39:57,434 --> 00:39:59,954
I'm hungry. Let's just go eat.

563
00:39:59,954 --> 00:40:02,052
Should we? What should we eat?

564
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:03,853
Me! That thing.

565
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:05,563
I want to eat that thing.

566
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:06,956
That thing.

567
00:40:14,262 --> 00:40:19,143
This exquisite taste
that reaches the depths of my soul.

568
00:40:19,143 --> 00:40:22,065
Why do you have so much to say
about a 6,000 won rice stew?

569
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:23,155
Hurry up and eat.

570
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:24,885
- Let's eat, everyone.
- Let's eat.

571
00:40:24,885 --> 00:40:27,338
Wait, wait, wait!

572
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:28,775
Where did you go?

573
00:40:28,775 --> 00:40:29,851
Well...

574
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:33,949
Here. Eat this first.

575
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,572
If you go into places like that,
you have to eat this once you come out.

576
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:40,972
It's so that you can become a new person.

577
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:44,434
Chew it up and eat it.
Then don't ever go near those places.

578
00:40:49,242 --> 00:40:50,693
Why aren't you eating it?

579
00:40:55,362 --> 00:40:58,871
Without meaning to,
I hid my identity.

580
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:01,289
I caused trouble and I'm really...

581
00:41:07,126 --> 00:41:08,356
happy!

582
00:41:10,688 --> 00:41:12,126
My goodness.

583
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:13,967
Oh gosh.

584
00:41:16,094 --> 00:41:17,257
Here.

585
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:42,481
CEO Byun asked for me.

586
00:41:42,481 --> 00:41:45,547
He just kicked out Young Master Hyuk.

587
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:49,949
- What?
- He kicked him out without even 10 won.

588
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:51,811
The mood is not good.

589
00:41:51,811 --> 00:41:55,460
Do whatever the CEO tells you to.

590
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,005
You need to bow down to him, okay?

591
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:04,206
Goodness.

592
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:20,050
Gosh, I told you to give it a rest.

593
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,684
Did the world end?

594
00:42:22,684 --> 00:42:25,929
How could you do this, Honey?

595
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:28,137
He doesn't have any money.

596
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:32,204
You're setting him up
to go out and starve to death.

597
00:42:32,204 --> 00:42:37,501
How ignorant of you to kick
him out in the nude like that.

598
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:39,184
Oh, my baby.

599
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:42,032
Where is my Hyuk?

600
00:42:42,032 --> 00:42:44,371
You told me to give him wings.

601
00:42:48,061 --> 00:42:49,992
What do you mean by that?

602
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:53,934
If he has wings, he'll fly.

603
00:42:56,342 --> 00:42:58,402
I don't know about a phoenix.

604
00:42:58,402 --> 00:43:03,143
But, we have to throw him out to find
out if he's a baby chick or an eagle.

605
00:43:04,193 --> 00:43:06,400
CEO, you have a guest.

606
00:43:06,402 --> 00:43:07,532
What?

607
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:14,313
Is he planning something?

608
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:24,458
Do you have any idea
where Hyuk might have gone?

609
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:27,507
No, I'll look into it once I leave.

610
00:43:27,507 --> 00:43:31,777
Once you find out his location,
report to me right away.

611
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:36,329
What is your plan?

612
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:38,114
Keep him close by.

613
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:41,896
Find out what he's doing and
what he's thinking.

614
00:43:41,896 --> 00:43:43,657
Give me detailed reports.

615
00:43:45,494 --> 00:43:47,655
<i>What could he be thinking?</i>

616
00:43:49,414 --> 00:43:53,677
Perhaps, he wanted it resolved
with as little talk as possible.

617
00:43:53,677 --> 00:43:59,148
If he wanted people to stop talking,
he should have handed Hyuk over.

618
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:03,626
He's taking criticism from
the media and public.

619
00:44:03,626 --> 00:44:05,516
Why protect Hyuk through all that?

620
00:44:05,516 --> 00:44:07,885
There is criticism.

621
00:44:07,885 --> 00:44:10,637
But, the victim came forward
and vindicated Hyuk.

622
00:44:10,637 --> 00:44:12,398
Wouldn't that resolve
the misunderstanding?

623
00:44:17,873 --> 00:44:20,105
People don't want the truth.

624
00:44:21,523 --> 00:44:24,554
They want to see bad people be punished.

625
00:44:24,554 --> 00:44:28,693
So, it doesn't matter if
that person is really bad or not.

626
00:44:28,693 --> 00:44:30,782
The thing I'm curious about is...

627
00:44:30,782 --> 00:44:35,054
why would he save Hyuk and
not the company at this juncture?

628
00:44:35,054 --> 00:44:36,855
What was Father thinking?

629
00:44:38,628 --> 00:44:42,367
Are you asking me to monitor Hyuk?

630
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,681
I just want to know something.

631
00:44:45,681 --> 00:44:49,981
So, report everything
about him directly to me.

632
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:57,954
You'll report to me first
before you tell my father, right?

633
00:44:59,454 --> 00:45:02,269
Don't go to anyone else first.
Come directly to me.

634
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:07,289
Let's filter out what
you report to the CEO.

635
00:45:10,985 --> 00:45:12,414
Yes, Chief.

636
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,076
Be careful so people
don't start talking about it.

637
00:45:19,105 --> 00:45:20,416
I understand, CEO.

638
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:49,567
Joon, how was I today?

639
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:51,806
I look great on TV, don't I?

640
00:45:53,076 --> 00:45:56,005
Byun Hyuk who was
determined to reveal the truth.

641
00:45:56,005 --> 00:45:57,838
I confidently made my way
to the prosecutor.

642
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,211
Wasn't I kind of cool?

643
00:45:59,211 --> 00:46:01,143
Did you go there to look cool?

644
00:46:01,143 --> 00:46:02,295
<i>I did.</i>

645
00:46:02,295 --> 00:46:05,114
You went in because you did
something wrong, so you had to go.

646
00:46:05,114 --> 00:46:08,284
Lots of people don't do
things that they should do.

647
00:46:08,284 --> 00:46:09,815
You don't believe my sincerity?

648
00:46:09,815 --> 00:46:12,815
I'm not the old me.
I've really changed.

649
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:15,394
So what if you've changed?
What does that have to do with me?

650
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:16,887
Why wouldn't it?

651
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:20,798
Didn't you see the letter I left you?

652
00:46:20,798 --> 00:46:24,809
<i>Please, call me by my name,
which suits my color and fragrance.</i>

653
00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:26,280
<i>I will go to you.</i>

654
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,902
Stop that.

655
00:46:27,902 --> 00:46:30,393
I have to go to work.
Go in by yourself.

656
00:46:39,804 --> 00:46:41,916
What? What is it?

657
00:46:43,096 --> 00:46:45,416
I don't know how this will sound to you.

658
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,146
But, I have no bus money.

659
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:08,266
Here.

660
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:16,670
Work is hard, isn't it?

661
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:24,471
Bow down when the wind blows and
take the rain when there's a storm.

662
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,286
To stay on the higher ups'
good side, that's the best way.

663
00:47:40,288 --> 00:47:41,990
<i>He was on the street,
so I picked him up.</i>

664
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:44,619
<i>I sent him to my place.
You go and take care of him.</i>

665
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,661
This punk.

666
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:56,621
- I need to go.
- Oh?

667
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,019
Make sure to behave well.

668
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:05,188
Father, I'll take care of it.

669
00:48:05,188 --> 00:48:06,288
All right.

670
00:48:49,603 --> 00:48:51,199
Woo!

671
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:54,347
I'm back.

672
00:48:54,347 --> 00:48:57,307
The paradise that I longed for.

673
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,833
When is Joon coming home?

674
00:49:06,635 --> 00:49:08,960
You have very unique taste.

675
00:49:13,672 --> 00:49:16,536
Which brand is that, exactly?

676
00:49:20,186 --> 00:49:22,567
Who needs brand names?

677
00:49:22,567 --> 00:49:24,766
Once I wear it,
it becomes designer level.

678
00:49:29,987 --> 00:49:31,807
Thank you for before.

679
00:49:33,336 --> 00:49:35,385
I didn't do it to get your thanks.

680
00:49:35,385 --> 00:49:37,557
I only told the truth.

681
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,206
Right? It was.

682
00:49:39,206 --> 00:49:40,871
The weather was bad that day.

683
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:45,190
Nonetheless, I felt sexually harassed
from my point of view and that's a fact.

684
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,710
Yes. You are right.

685
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,655
That is a fact.

686
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,114
Still...

687
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:57,483
I didn't think it was right for all
that noise and criticism either.

688
00:49:57,483 --> 00:49:59,632
There was also what Joon said too.

689
00:50:02,512 --> 00:50:03,722
Joon?

690
00:50:04,742 --> 00:50:06,144
What did she say?

691
00:50:06,144 --> 00:50:10,432
Whether you make
a statement or not, that's up to you.

692
00:50:10,432 --> 00:50:15,840
However, shouldn't you go and tell the
truth about why that happened that day?

693
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:23,076
Joon?

694
00:50:24,744 --> 00:50:26,014
For me?

695
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:29,016
For me?

696
00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:31,670
The thing that really offended
me and made me angry...

697
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,500
was that no one
gave me a sincere apology.

698
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,445
It was your attitude
of trying cover it up with money.

699
00:50:37,445 --> 00:50:40,501
And? What else did Joon say?

700
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:42,942
Did she have any other worries about me?

701
00:50:42,942 --> 00:50:44,570
I'm begging you, please.

702
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:49,344
If there's anything else you can recall,
please tell me anything, all of it.

703
00:50:51,152 --> 00:50:53,059
Are you sure you're not a pervert?

704
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:54,199
What?

705
00:50:57,161 --> 00:50:58,436
Oh!

706
00:51:04,847 --> 00:51:07,000
I'm not. It's a misunderstanding again.

707
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,311
I don't know why
this keeps happening to me.

708
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,943
I'm very sorry for this misunderstanding.

709
00:51:13,943 --> 00:51:16,507
Please don't tell Joon.

710
00:51:16,509 --> 00:51:19,286
Gosh, seriously. I ought to just...

711
00:51:22,326 --> 00:51:25,039
Ah... Mother.

712
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:27,059
Hello.

713
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:28,181
Mother?

714
00:51:34,552 --> 00:51:36,862
Mother? Whose mother?

715
00:51:36,862 --> 00:51:38,590
Who else? Joon's mother.

716
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,891
Oh, really?

717
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:42,018
Is she out of money again?

718
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:43,402
Money?

719
00:51:43,402 --> 00:51:46,182
Every time Joon's about to save
money, she comes and takes it all.

720
00:51:46,182 --> 00:51:47,625
Then she comes again and again.

721
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:48,807
What?

722
00:51:48,807 --> 00:51:52,135
Why? Why would a parent
take their child's money?

723
00:51:52,135 --> 00:51:54,137
I know. That's what I'm saying...

724
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,019
It's a secret that I told you this.

725
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:01,056
Then the lingerie thing is a secret too.

726
00:52:01,057 --> 00:52:02,420
- Deal.
- Deal.

727
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,543
She's here for money?

728
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,222
Hey!

729
00:52:38,692 --> 00:52:41,652
Who said you could put this garbage here?

730
00:52:41,652 --> 00:52:43,603
Seriously, so annoying!

731
00:52:43,603 --> 00:52:46,173
Sorry. I'm sorry, Sir.

732
00:52:46,173 --> 00:52:47,355
Move!

733
00:52:47,355 --> 00:52:48,429
Sorry.

734
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:50,815
Don't do anything
you have to be sorry for then.

735
00:53:15,155 --> 00:53:17,701
<i>Joon, your mom is here.</i>

736
00:53:57,257 --> 00:53:59,146
You're just getting home? You're late.

737
00:54:07,746 --> 00:54:10,277
You should've called
if you ran out of side dishes.

738
00:54:10,277 --> 00:54:13,065
All the food in your fridge
was instant food.

739
00:54:13,065 --> 00:54:15,179
I told you that
I can't get you that money.

740
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,530
Do you think I'm here for money?

741
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:20,219
I came to see your face.

742
00:54:22,648 --> 00:54:24,675
Why are you doing this to me?

743
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:26,500
Did you leave some
money of yours with me?

744
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,788
Or did I borrow money from you, Mom?

745
00:54:28,788 --> 00:54:31,038
Why are always coming
to me with your hand out?

746
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:35,673
Eat up. It's your favorite, potato stew.

747
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:39,574
I really think I'm going to go
insane whenever you do this.

748
00:54:39,574 --> 00:54:40,784
Do you know that?

749
00:54:40,784 --> 00:54:43,784
I never asked you for money,
even when I was in school.

750
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:47,286
After I graduated high school,
I did everything on my own.

751
00:54:47,286 --> 00:54:49,784
What did you do for me
that you're acting like this?

752
00:54:49,784 --> 00:54:52,724
Why do you show up
so brazen with no shame?

753
00:54:52,724 --> 00:54:55,536
How can you hold your hand out to me?

754
00:54:55,536 --> 00:55:00,923
I don't even expect a mom
that I can rely on in my life.

755
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:05,076
At least, stop expecting
things from me, would you?

756
00:55:06,443 --> 00:55:09,224
I said stop doing that!

757
00:55:11,255 --> 00:55:13,507
Eat your rice.

758
00:55:13,507 --> 00:55:16,175
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

759
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:37,099
I'm sorry.

760
00:55:39,181 --> 00:55:40,742
I'm a bad mom.

761
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,030
Mom.

762
00:55:51,385 --> 00:55:54,275
I really don’t have 10 million won.

763
00:55:56,065 --> 00:55:58,215
Yes, I know.

764
00:55:58,215 --> 00:56:00,141
Just eat your rice.

765
00:56:37,422 --> 00:56:39,036
What are you doing?

766
00:56:43,018 --> 00:56:44,208
Sit down.

767
00:56:46,775 --> 00:56:48,030
Why were you there?

768
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,603
Why are you always
hanging around Joon's place?

769
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:53,125
One moment, Jae Hoon.

770
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,273
Jae Hoon, do you happen
to have 10 million won?

771
00:57:07,981 --> 00:57:09,211
What are you talking about?

772
00:57:09,211 --> 00:57:11,019
Why do you suddenly need
10 million won?

773
00:57:14,112 --> 00:57:16,119
Honestly, the thing is...

774
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:19,802
Joon's mother is here.

775
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:23,961
Joon is crying.

776
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:27,210
It's not even 1 billion won
or 100 million won.

777
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,659
It's only 10 million won.

778
00:57:30,735 --> 00:57:34,547
You just got kicked out
of your house like a bum.

779
00:57:34,547 --> 00:57:35,947
Should you be worrying about Joon?

780
00:57:35,947 --> 00:57:38,556
No, no. It's the time to worry about me.

781
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:41,478
In two or three days,
Mom will have cooked Father alive.

782
00:57:41,478 --> 00:57:43,088
Then he will have cooled down.

783
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:46,123
That's when I'll go back naturally.

784
00:57:46,123 --> 00:57:48,943
No, that won't be long enough.

785
00:57:50,344 --> 00:57:53,114
Five days? Will it be a week?

786
00:57:53,114 --> 00:57:56,231
You can't take care of yourself
and you want 10 million won?

787
00:57:56,231 --> 00:57:57,532
What a joke.

788
00:57:58,481 --> 00:58:01,208
Joon is crying right now!

789
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:02,592
Can't you do it?

790
00:58:04,954 --> 00:58:07,958
If you're so worried,
then look into it yourself.

791
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:13,182
That guy is so cold.
He has no blood or tears.

792
00:58:14,344 --> 00:58:16,887
Joon is crying right now.

793
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:14,106
Wait, how could you not have
10 million won, Mom?

794
01:00:14,106 --> 01:00:16,878
Don't be like this. I really need it.

795
01:00:16,878 --> 01:00:18,567
For real, right now.

796
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:20,041
It's your father's orders.

797
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:22,581
We can't give you a thing.

798
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:23,822
Mom.

799
01:00:24,902 --> 01:00:26,985
Do you think only
your accounts are blocked?

800
01:00:26,985 --> 01:00:29,385
Mine have all been blocked
for the time being.

801
01:00:29,385 --> 01:00:31,637
<i>The combinations for the safes
have been changed too.</i>

802
01:00:31,637 --> 01:00:35,603
He says he's going to check all of
my credit card transactions.

803
01:00:35,603 --> 01:00:41,193
Unless you want to see me
get divorced, just hang up.

804
01:00:41,193 --> 01:00:42,373
Seriously...

805
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:57,431
Se Na, it's your older brother.
Send me 10 million won.

806
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,530
You heard what Mom said.

807
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,320
Can't you see what's going on?

808
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:06,411
If I give you 10 won,
Dad said he'll kick me out too.

809
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:09,349
If you don't want to see a divorce
and me getting kicked out too

810
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:11,135
please get it together, okay?

811
01:01:19,907 --> 01:01:23,360
Is this for real, a true story? Huh?

812
01:01:26,802 --> 01:01:28,882
That measly 10 million won.

813
01:01:28,882 --> 01:01:30,974
It's not even much.
Why's everyone being this way?

814
01:01:32,141 --> 01:01:34,780
It may be a measly 10 million won to you.

815
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:38,471
To some, it's big money that they may
or may not be able to save in a year.

816
01:01:40,878 --> 01:01:42,429
You really don't have 10 million won?

817
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:48,469
I barely managed to get you your phone.

818
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:50,155
Be thankful for that.

819
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,436
So cold, so cold, so cold.

820
01:02:06,864 --> 01:02:09,277
<i>Hyuk! I saw the news.</i>

821
01:02:09,277 --> 01:02:11,313
<i>You looked great on TV.</i>

822
01:02:11,313 --> 01:02:13,244
Gosh, what does she want now?

823
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:30,380
Hyuk, Hyuk, Hyuk!

824
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,923
Hyuk! Oh, Hyuk!

825
01:02:34,329 --> 01:02:37,809
Seriously, you look
like you suffered so much.

826
01:02:37,809 --> 01:02:41,490
Do you know how worried Chae Ri
was when she couldn't reach you?

827
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:42,539
Yes.

828
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:47,510
Let's calm down and let me
ask you for a favor.

829
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,851
Ask me for anything.

830
01:02:48,851 --> 01:02:50,568
Lend me 10 million won.

831
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:56,139
I need it urgently.

832
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,639
Lend me 10 million won.

833
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:01,128
Hyuk, I understand you're mad at me.

834
01:03:01,128 --> 01:03:02,659
You're wrong about that day.

835
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:05,798
I've forgotten about that day and
I have nothing to be mad about.

836
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:07,998
So, just that 10 million won.

837
01:03:07,998 --> 01:03:12,059
Look, I get that you're mad.

838
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:14,708
How could you ask
to break up in such a dirty way?

839
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,278
What are you talking about?

840
01:03:16,278 --> 01:03:18,099
We are already broken up.

841
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:20,545
Since when? When did we break up?

842
01:03:20,545 --> 01:03:22,704
I never broke up with you.

843
01:03:23,764 --> 01:03:26,315
Chae Ri... Chae Ri!

844
01:03:26,315 --> 01:03:29,795
No matter how unreasonable
you're being, this is not right.

845
01:03:29,795 --> 01:03:33,036
Sung Kyu is my friend.

846
01:03:33,036 --> 01:03:36,367
Does Sung Kyu know you're doing this?

847
01:03:36,367 --> 01:03:39,184
Sung Kyu and I are not in a relationship.

848
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:42,264
It was all a misunderstanding that day.

849
01:03:42,264 --> 01:03:45,476
That's the bag that I bought you, right?

850
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:49,416
I remember it being worth
more than 10 million won.

851
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:52,456
If you don't want to give
me money, give that back to me.

852
01:03:55,463 --> 01:03:57,014
No, you can't!

853
01:03:59,349 --> 01:04:00,750
You're crazy.

854
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:05,222
I really don't like
your personality today.

855
01:04:05,222 --> 01:04:06,869
Contact me once you feel better.

856
01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:09,193
No matter how mad you are, this is wrong.

857
01:04:19,858 --> 01:04:21,052
What a waste.

858
01:04:50,869 --> 01:04:52,063
Are you doing well?

859
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:01,114
Your account matures in a month
and you're going to close it?

860
01:05:01,114 --> 01:05:05,143
If you close it now,
you won't get much interest.

861
01:05:05,143 --> 01:05:07,943
It won't amount to much anyway.

862
01:05:07,943 --> 01:05:09,786
- Please do it.
- Okay.

863
01:05:22,146 --> 01:05:23,277
Woo Sung!

864
01:05:28,795 --> 01:05:29,862
Hyuk.

865
01:05:31,378 --> 01:05:32,389
Are you okay?

866
01:05:32,389 --> 01:05:34,556
Yeah, I suppose.

867
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:37,179
I was about to go
for a lunch appointment.

868
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:38,539
I'll cancel it. Let's go eat.

869
01:05:38,539 --> 01:05:40,443
No, Woo Sung. I don't need to eat.

870
01:05:40,443 --> 01:05:43,217
Actually, I came to ask for a favor.

871
01:05:47,572 --> 01:05:49,128
Can you give me 10 million won?

872
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:57,815
I only have 3,000 won.
Can you give me 10?

873
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:00,556
They're for my mom.

874
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:01,688
All right.

875
01:06:01,688 --> 01:06:03,418
Thank you!

876
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,199
- Here you go.
- Here.

877
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:06,639
Thank you. Sell lots.

878
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:07,820
Come again.

879
01:06:12,331 --> 01:06:15,429
<i>To tell you the truth,
there's a girl I like.</i>

880
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,659
I'm home.

881
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:23,880
