You need to pay up.

20
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,152
Don't play dumb.
Pay up now or you'll go to jail.

21
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:37,383
How would you get
your hands on my assets?

22

You should have some rice wine too.

Why would a young lady
who graduated college live this way?

56
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,790
It's a waste of time and money to
spend money building up my resume.

57
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,750
You're right. Who here hasn't
graduated from college?

Your chairman is so strict.

86
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,600
He should let his employees

Lack of responsibility.

95
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:45,817

00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:48,362
Where is the son of

One moment. One moment.

122
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,269
This is Hankook Air,
flight from Bali to Incheon.

123
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:34,220
Many of the passengers are complaining,
so may we end this call?

Not there. Down here.

128
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:00,708
Can't you give me just one more drink?

129
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,908
I'm begging you, please.

130
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:07,298
According to our regulations,
any more will be a problem.

131
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:11,379
Everyone, everyone!
She is providing me bad service.

132
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,462
How do I get out of here?

133
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:15,857
It's dangerous. You shouldn't stand.

134

Oh no!

I will be shooting my Taser at you now!

139
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:07,124
What an amusing story.

140
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:11,673
I'm sorry to interrupt.

141
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:16,004
Oh, your eldest son is handsome

142
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:17,580
Thank you.

143
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,306
I don't see your second son though.

144
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:22,287
He's on his way now.

145
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:25,783
He has a severe cold.
I don't think he'll be able to make it.

146
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:27,826
Why? Did he cause trouble again?

147
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:29,616
Come on, now.

148
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:33,985
One moment, Father.

149
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,331
You know I have a fear of flying, right?

150
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:58,042
I'm really scared of turbulence.

151
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:02,823
What happened was that I stood up
and then there was severe turbulence.

152
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:06,894
When that suddenly happened,
I held on to anything that could save me.

153
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,865
So, you grabbed
the flight attendant's breasts?

154
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:10,404
That's right.

155
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:15,472
Oh my.

156
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,811
I was filled with terror
and thought we would crash.

157
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:24,498
Can't you understand?

158
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:26,955
On my life, it won't happen again.

159
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:31,173
In the center of my business...

160
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:35,052
there has always been love.

161
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:38,678

Gangsu Group will be a company that

Please calm down and listen.

It's not an excuse. I had my reasons.

179
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:38,594
Get over here. Get over here!

180
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:41,666
You punk! How did I have a son like you?

181
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:46,517
I wasn't a good mother
and it's all my fault.

182
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:47,850
Don't blame yourself, Mom.

183
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,950
How many times did I tell you?
I was in a rush to come out.

184
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:54,706
You were born at seven months.
You shouldn't make your mom suffer now.

185
00:14:54,706 --> 00:14:57,554
Get your act together
and live like a proper human being!

186
00:14:57,554 --> 00:14:59,321
Father! Your blood pressure...

187
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:00,359
Blood pressure?

188
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:05,816
Before you worry about my blood pressure,
worry about your own legs!

189
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:09,784
Get over here.

190
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,702
Chairman, I brought it.

191
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,701
If you come at me like this,
I can't communicate with you.

192
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:16,676
What? Communicate?

193
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:20,482
Hyuk, just beg for forgiveness.
Say that you're sorry.

194
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:22,764
Why do you get angry
before even listening?

195
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:24,381
Section Chief Kwon, bend over.

196
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,062
- Father!
- Yes, Chairman.

197
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:28,182
No, Jae Hoon didn't do anything wrong.

198
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:32,355
He let a ticking time bomb
like you on a plane alone.

199
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:34,496
I lied to Jae Hoon and got on the plane!

200
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:38,511
You punks. You're both the same.

201
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:41,964
You have nothing better to do
than eat and act this way.

202
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:43,270
Father!

203
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:48,273
I'm sorry, Father.

204
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:51,469
Everything is my fault.

205
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,861
If you're going to
hit someone, then hit me.

206
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:04,152
Keep him out of my sight
for the time being.

207
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,467
Got it?

208
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:14,183
Thank you, Section Chief Kwon.

209
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,014
Get up now.

210
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:35,570
Why is it that my own father
won't even bother listening to me?

211
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,966
I have my reasons too.

212
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:44,418
I think he's just getting angry
because he wants to.

213
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:49,817
I suppose I should just obey.

214
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:51,623
It's my living.

215
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:54,489
You should know
you can enjoy that privilege.

216
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,086
Before you start complaining...

217
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:01,980
Is that how it is?

218
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:04,464
Good job, everyone.

219
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:06,441
- Good job.
- Good job.

220
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,455
Will you be okay
to clean up alone, Baek Joon?

221
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:15,354
Of course, I should do this much,
at the very least.

222
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:16,748
You should go home.

223
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:19,287
I can always count on you to do your job.

224
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:20,984
Then I'll trust you and go.

225
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:23,664
- Yes. Thank you, Manager.
- Thanks.

226
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,755
I'm home.

227
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:25,276
Hello. Good morning.

228
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:27,104
Here's your drink.

229
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:28,940
Hello.

230
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,780
Looks like you have dark circles.

231
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:33,353
You'd better have some.
Please go on and have it.

232
00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:34,675
Thank you.

233
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:36,865
Hello. Good morning.

234
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:47,759
Hello. Good morning.

235
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,096
Section Chief Kwon,
when did you get promoted?

236
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:54,701
I told you I wouldn't drink that.

237
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:57,693
You got a promotion.
Why don't buy some?

238
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:01,642
Help me increase sales.

239
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,582
Follow me.

240
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:15,460
Take this.

241
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:17,317
What is this?

242
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,678
An application for new employees.

243
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:23,277
Why would you give me this?

244
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:27,060
For someone like you,
I can ask HR to get you an interview.

245
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,299
Isn't that why you're
delivering the green smoothie?

246
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:34,644
Don't go from department to department
showing your face around.

247
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:37,449
Getting people to know your face
like that isn't going to help.

248
00:21:37,449 --> 00:21:39,564
It'll lose you points during interviews.

249
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,270
Why?

250
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:47,125
Because it's a lowly job
to deliver smoothies?

251
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:52,237
Hey, a person's value is
determined by the work they do.

252
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,030
You must be mistaken thinking that
the work you do is highly valued.

253
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,209
I don't want to make money
cleaning up after rich people.

254
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,780
Stop it with that pride of yours.

255
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,496
The work you do ends up
earning money for that CEO too.

256
00:22:07,496 --> 00:22:11,267
No, I don't act as a fixer
for my employer's son.

257
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:13,576
It's been quiet lately.

258
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:15,795
It was fun seeing
your face in the papers.

259
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,724
I'm telling you one more time.

260
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:24,786
I have no interest in being a full-time
employee, especially for your company.

261
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:40,903
<i>[Gangsu Group Second Son
Mister B, Drunk Driving]</i>

262
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:43,125
Gangsu Group's second son, Byun Hyuk.

263
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,820
He's famous.

264
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:52,700
Drunk driving, not paying bills
at clubs, public urination.

265
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,810
The cases are always buried.

266
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,039
And every time, you appear in the media.

267
00:22:57,778 --> 00:23:00,563
But this airplane incident is a big case.

268
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:03,579
It's at a different level
than these little crimes.

269
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:04,750
I know that.

270
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:07,183
Have you eaten?

271
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:08,876
It's still early.

272
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:10,319
Is it?

273
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,047
It's been so long since
I've eaten at the right meal time.

274
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,713
That's how prosecutors are.

275
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:18,757
I can't eat or sleep.
I have to do everything at once.

276
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,771
What isn't hard in this world?

277
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:37,958
It must be hard for you too,
running chores for these rich folks.

278
00:23:38,873 --> 00:23:43,305
Then I'll assume this has been resolved
and I'll get going, Senior.

279
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:49,214
I thought you would come work for me.

280
00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:51,566
Weren't you preparing
to take the prosecutor exam?

281
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,444
I was surprised to hear
you went to Gangsu Group.

282
00:23:55,444 --> 00:23:57,936
You were the top of your class.

283
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,188
Why do you live like this?

284
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:14,384
You and I aren't very different.

285
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:16,603
We both live off a salary.

286
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:20,525
Are you looking down on me
for accepting this money?

287
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:22,934
I know how it is.

288
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:26,548
It's hard to refuse orders
coming from your superiors.

289
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:29,944
This isn't a bribe I'm offering.

290
00:24:29,944 --> 00:24:32,978
- It's a bonus.
- Oh, look at you.

291
00:24:32,978 --> 00:24:36,421
By the way,
call me if you ever need anything.

292
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:40,914
I can always find a job for you
in our legal department.

293
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,038
I can offer you any salary you wish.

294
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:50,405
I'll get going, then.

295
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:02,092
I met the prosecutor in charge
and took care of it.

296
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:05,134
This is the original file
and there are no copies.

297
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:08,773
I know he's my little brother,
but gosh...

298
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,605
I really don't know what he's thinking.

299
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:14,866
He's very emotional,
so he makes many mistakes.

300
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:20,843
Thanks to you, Section Chief Kwon,
we were able to keep this quiet.

301
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:23,755
Since he got into trouble,
he should be quiet for a bit.

302
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:24,863
I hope so.

303
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:27,584
Where is he now?

304
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,863
Our separation can't be
so empty like this.

305
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:52,781
I'm sure something unavoidable
came up for Chae Ri.

306
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:55,526
I'll assume she can't contact me for now.

307
00:25:55,526 --> 00:25:57,222
Don't obsess over it.

308
00:26:05,426 --> 00:26:06,726
What are you looking at?

309
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:08,368
<i>- I didn't look.
- You did.</i>

310
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:10,766
<i>You're the prettiest, Honey.</i>

311
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,009
<i>Hey, I really didn't look. I didn't.</i>

312
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:15,690
<i>Come on, Honey.</i>

313
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,077
- You did too.
- Come and catch me.

314
00:26:20,757 --> 00:26:22,027
Chae Ri.

315
00:26:23,464 --> 00:26:25,182
I'm positive that was Chae Ri's voice.

316
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:27,615
Chae Ri, Chae Ri!

317
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:39,767
My key... key.

318
00:26:40,218 --> 00:26:41,518
What do I do?

319
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,144
Chae Ri and Sung Kyu?

320
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:16,000
29, 30.

321
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:21,388
Chae Ri... Chae Ri.

322
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:22,613
Chae Ri...

323
00:27:28,151 --> 00:27:29,397
Chae Ri.

324
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:33,432
I'm sure it's Chae Ri.

325
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:41,273
Oh my! My earrings, my earrings!

326
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:43,876
Honey, Honey!

327
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:46,303
What is it, my Honey?

328
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:05,262
You were the only one
who came into this room.

329
00:28:05,932 --> 00:28:09,763
You can't accuse me
just because I was in this room.

330
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:18,048
Oh my.

331
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,849
How can you be so pretty
even when you're angry?

332
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:24,128
Don't get too angry.
You'll get wrinkles.

333
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:27,019
I'll just buy you another pair.

334
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:33,608
<i>You look so shameless.
Who do you think you're lying to?</i>

335
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:39,200
You think you're the first person
like this I've come across?

336
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:55,252
<i>Hyuk!</i>

337
00:28:55,938 --> 00:28:59,057
Chae Ri wants all of this and this.

338
00:28:59,057 --> 00:29:01,313
Sure, of course. Buy it all.

339
00:29:01,313 --> 00:29:02,721
Really?

340
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:06,605
Here you go. I'll buy it all.

341
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,440
Hyuk! This one too.

342
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,842
Yes, of course.

343
00:29:09,842 --> 00:29:11,242
Hyuk, what about this one?

344
00:29:11,242 --> 00:29:12,631
- Hyuk?
- We'll take it all.

345
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:14,839
Hyuk, thank you.

346
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:23,123
In celebration of Hyuk
and Chae Ri's 30th day...

347
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:24,590
Let's get loud!

348
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:28,589
You two should now kiss.

349
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:31,786
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

350
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:34,634
Kiss, kiss!

351
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:38,625
We envy you.

352
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:43,955
<i>Hyuk, go to Bali first and
I'll be right behind you, okay?</i>

353
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:51,469
If it wasn't you,
then where's the other one?

354
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:53,720
You were the only person
who cleaned this place.

355
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,711
I only did the duties required of me.

356
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,842
I never even saw garbage like that.

357
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:01,551
So, if you insist on
accusing me of theft...

358
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:05,923
please come up with real proof.

359
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,410
I find it suspicious that a young person
would even do a job like this.

360
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,749
Are you doing this to steal from guests?

361
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:14,358
What did you just say?

362
00:30:14,878 --> 00:30:16,819
Who do you think
you're speaking rudely to?

363
00:30:19,304 --> 00:30:20,771
Are you serious?

364
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,971
- Stop!
- Honey!

365
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:26,484
What are you doing?

366
00:30:26,484 --> 00:30:27,916
Let her go.

367
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,106
Apologize now!

368
00:30:29,106 --> 00:30:31,926
She grabbed my hair first.
She should apologize first.

369
00:30:31,926 --> 00:30:34,613
Baek Joon, let her go!

370
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:40,757
Why should I be
the only one apologizing? Why?

371
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:44,115
Because she's our guest.

372
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:52,278
I'm very sorry for the bother.

373
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:55,587
We'll do our best to find your lost item.

374
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,391
If we cannot find it,
we will compensate you for it.

375
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:03,881
I'll need an apology for her speaking
so rudely to me before any of that.

376
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:08,680
What are you doing, Baek Joon?
Apologize to her now.

377
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:10,856
Baek Joon!

378
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:14,528
Seriously!

379
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,352
You're crazy!

380
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:39,252
That's right. I am crazy.

381
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:42,693
I'll end up losing money I haven't
touched yet if I can't find it.

382
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,794
Of course I'd be crazy.
Why wouldn't I be?

383
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:47,163
Baek Joon, stop this immediately.

384
00:31:47,163 --> 00:31:48,391
You said to find it.

385
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:52,016
First, as an employee,
you should make the guest feel better.

386
00:31:52,016 --> 00:31:54,006
Didn't you hear me tell you to apologize?

387
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:56,045
Why should I when I haven't
done anything wrong?

388
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:58,961
Because the guest... is king.

389
00:32:02,384 --> 00:32:03,557
Gosh...

390
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:09,523
Hyuk... Hyuk...

391
00:32:18,516 --> 00:32:21,988
That hurts!

392
00:32:23,794 --> 00:32:25,000
What is this?

393
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:47,845
Oh, my earring!

394
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:52,200
My earring!

395
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,887
Move your foot right now!

396
00:32:54,888 --> 00:32:57,042
King? Give me a break.

397
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,455
The person who is wrong should apologize.

398
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:02,615
Hey, rude girl. Apologize to me.

399
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:05,351
I'll move my foot aside nicely
if you apologize.

400
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:07,464
Awesome.

401
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:09,419
Hey, you psycho!

402
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:17,567
I'm so sorry.

403
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:30,701
Hey... I could take you down
so easily, you little thing.

404
00:33:31,561 --> 00:33:35,016
I could sue you for false accusation.

405
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:38,428
I won't bother
because it's a waste of paper.

406
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,461
I'm sorry. I sincerely apologize.

407
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:51,372
Look here, Baek Joon!

408
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:54,854
This is so annoying!

409
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,946
Hyuk?

410
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,503
Hyuk.

411
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:14,224
Hyuk... Hyuk!

412
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,989
No!

413
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:19,628
So annoying! So, so annoying.

414
00:34:20,846 --> 00:34:23,903
<i>I've lost love and I feel bitter.</i>

415
00:34:24,686 --> 00:34:27,849
<i>Farewell, those short nights.</i>

416
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:32,702
<i>Farewell, they no longer belong to me...</i>

417
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:34,335
<i>these desires.</i>

418
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:42,869
Even if you are a part-timer...

419
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:45,063
You don't have the basics as an employee.

420
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:48,079
Doing the labor and receiving pay
is enough as an employee.

421
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,385
Must I sell my pride too?

422
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:51,793
Money is pride, at least here.

423
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:55,552
The money you earn comes out
from that guest's wallet.

424
00:34:56,851 --> 00:34:58,463
That's not really right.

425
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:05,275
2,470 won per hour is too low to ask me
to sell off my pride and feelings.

426
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:07,920
If that's a problem for you,
you should quit, right?

427
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,135
What do you mean, quit?

428
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:13,936
How can you fire an employee
who hasn't done anything wrong?

429
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:21,976
Stay quiet for now.
Don't make any noise for now.

430
00:35:23,434 --> 00:35:28,005
Anyway, you're telling a person accused
of theft they should always say sorry.

431
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:30,257
Isn't that a bit unfair?

432
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:33,052
You... you....

433
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:39,583
Are... are people training employees
properly these days or not?

434
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:40,914
Forget it.

435
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:44,161
Please just deposit my wages
from last month into my account.

436
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:45,304
By today.

437
00:35:45,304 --> 00:35:46,545
The guest is king?

438
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,539
This is a world where even presidents
can get dragged out when wrong.

439
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:51,061
What are you talking about?

440
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:52,329
That's what I'm saying.

441
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:55,500
Guest is king? That's so old-fashioned.

442
00:35:56,347 --> 00:35:59,418
Why, you... you... you...

443
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:03,847
Both of you, get out right now.

444
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:09,304
Aren't you leaving? Get out now.

445
00:36:09,304 --> 00:36:11,106
I can go on my own.

446
00:36:11,106 --> 00:36:13,494
Get out of here, both of you.

447
00:36:17,266 --> 00:36:19,170
This is wrongful termination.

448
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,862
Is it wrong to ask to be treated
with respect as an employee?

449
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:23,114
Wrongful termination?

450
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,224
I know I've heard that somewhere.

451
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:29,601
My goodness.

452
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,697
You treat your employees this way,
but you promise the best service?

453
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:39,586
I hope your crappy hotel goes into ruin!

454
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:45,610
There's no need to curse them.

455
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,130
What's with you anyway?

456
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,313
Well, I'm just...

457
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:51,862
Are you a part-timer too?
Do you work in the spa?

458
00:36:51,862 --> 00:36:53,369
No, that's not it.

459
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:55,777
You're not a full-time employee, are you?

460
00:36:56,943 --> 00:36:58,844
They chased you out anyway?

461
00:36:59,362 --> 00:37:00,989
<i>[Full-time employee?]</i>
Wow.

462
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:04,530
<i>[Part-timer?]</i>
This is a terrible hotel.

463
00:37:07,003 --> 00:37:09,239
You should report to the Labor Ministry.

464
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:11,992
I don't think I need to do that.

465
00:37:11,992 --> 00:37:14,347
People always take it and
that's why they behave that way.

466
00:37:14,347 --> 00:37:17,048
Report them and get them fined.

467
00:37:17,048 --> 00:37:20,746
Get your back wages
and your legal fees too, okay?

468
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:22,969
Do I have to?

469
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:26,070
Good luck. I hope you win.

470
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:35,369
Anyway, thank you
for fighting with me, comrade.

471
00:37:44,878 --> 00:37:46,083
Excuse me...

472
00:37:50,257 --> 00:37:51,958
What's your name?

473
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:54,561
Me? Baek Joon.

474
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,376
Ah, Baek Joon.

475
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:02,471
What's your name?

476
00:38:04,112 --> 00:38:05,431
Hyuk.

477
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:08,003
Byun Hyuk.

478
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,583
Byun... Hyuk.

479
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,376
That's a good name.
It has a good feeling.

480
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,313
Goodbye, Byun Hyuk.

481
00:38:28,545 --> 00:38:30,998
<i>Before she called out my name...</i>

482
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:36,380
<i>I did not make a single movement.</i>

483
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,505
<i>When she called out my name...</i>

484
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:46,255
<i>for the first time...
I became a flower.</i>

485
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:03,568
What's this?

486
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:06,528
Why are you blocking me from entering?

487
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:11,003
Just leave for today.

488
00:39:11,003 --> 00:39:14,778
Soon, we will calculate the funds
you earned along with that woman.

489
00:39:14,778 --> 00:39:16,610
They will be deposited in your account.

490
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,416
Ah, you must be mistaken
because of my clothes.

491
00:39:24,076 --> 00:39:25,717
I don't work here.

492
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:32,313
The manager has ordered us to
keep out employees who cause problems.

493
00:39:33,617 --> 00:39:36,945
Oh, you really don't understand.

494
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:40,043
I really didn't want
to reveal my identity.

495
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:42,342
Don't reveal yourself.

496
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:44,728
Don't ever tell anyone who you are.

497
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:50,199
I'm Byun Hyuk of Gangsu.

498
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:56,626
I'm CEO Byun Gang Su's son!

499
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,981
It's the truth! Believe me!

500
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,666
- Hey!
- Be quiet!

501
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,833
I'm Byun Gang Su's son!

502
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,159
Let go, let go!

503
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:08,306
Put him down. Put him down.

504
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:18,333
I am Byun Gang Su's son!

505
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,755
Please just be quiet!

506
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:22,275
Do we really need to
call the police on you?

507
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,815
If there's any more bad gossip about you,
you and I are both dead.

508
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:38,880
My friend. My friend...

509
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,358
Those jerks.

510
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:56,436
They just kick me out like that?

511
00:40:57,742 --> 00:41:01,275
I have no phone or wallet.
What do I do?

512
00:41:22,034 --> 00:41:23,775
Oh, comrade.

513
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,496
You get on the bus here too?

514
00:41:25,496 --> 00:41:27,231
Huh? Yeah.

515
00:41:27,231 --> 00:41:29,351
Oh, you got hurt.

516
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:33,472
I went back to the hotel
and got in a little fight.

517
00:41:33,472 --> 00:41:35,112
You were beaten up by them?

518
00:41:38,188 --> 00:41:41,400
No, it was just a little bit.

519
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,831
No, I was like Sparta
against all them coming at me.

520
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:50,371
Now that you mention it,
could I use your phone to make a call?

521
00:41:50,371 --> 00:41:53,376
I left my phone and wallet in the hotel.

522
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:56,391
They won't even let you
get your belongings from the hotel?

523
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:58,882
They are worse than I imagined.

524
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:01,351
Here, use it. Use it as much as you need.

525
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:02,599
Okay.

526
00:42:09,204 --> 00:42:10,617
Is it not working?

527
00:42:11,304 --> 00:42:14,335
I always use speed dial.

528
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:17,199
I suddenly can't remember the number.

529
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:23,335
My bus is coming. I have to go.

530
00:42:24,204 --> 00:42:25,777
Oh, thank you.

531
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:48,510
Have you eaten?

532
00:42:58,855 --> 00:43:00,226
How may I help you?

533
00:43:00,226 --> 00:43:01,659
I need a suite room opened.

534
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:03,554
I can't find one
of your checked-in guests.

535
00:43:03,554 --> 00:43:05,735
It's against our rules to open them.

536
00:43:05,735 --> 00:43:08,014
I'm from the management team
at Gangsu Group.

537
00:43:08,014 --> 00:43:11,565
The guest is Byun Hyuk,
the second son of CEO Byun Gang Su.

538
00:43:15,936 --> 00:43:17,030
<i>[Chairman's son]</i>

539
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:21,228
I'm Byun Hyuk.
I'm CEO Byun Gang Su's son!

540
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:28,144
This seasoning...

541
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:33,019
The salted shrimp.

542
00:43:35,023 --> 00:43:36,621
Sesame seed powder.

543
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:41,402
Some of this onion.

544
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:44,418
Pour in the radish kimchi soup.

545
00:43:57,047 --> 00:43:59,659
Yum... yes.

546
00:43:59,659 --> 00:44:03,449
People like us who work part-time
have to eat food with protein.

547
00:44:03,952 --> 00:44:05,208
Why aren't you eating?

548
00:44:06,483 --> 00:44:07,655
What is this?

549
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:10,963
Pork rice stew.

550
00:44:12,795 --> 00:44:14,697
Is this your first time seeing it?

551
00:44:14,697 --> 00:44:17,097
I've never seen
pork intestines in a stew.

552
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,032
You must be picky about food.

553
00:44:21,682 --> 00:44:23,771
- Just try it.
- Okay.

554
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:29,543
Hey, try some of that meat there.

555
00:44:30,431 --> 00:44:32,273
I've never seen meat like this before.

556
00:44:33,572 --> 00:44:35,661
That's pig's head.

557
00:44:35,661 --> 00:44:38,882
That's heart, that's brain,
and that is the ear.

558
00:44:40,288 --> 00:44:41,434
Ear?

559
00:44:42,456 --> 00:44:44,289
A pig's ear?

560
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:45,391
Yes.

561
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,364
Don't eat it if you don't want to.

562
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:55,255
For me, this is soul food. It's so good.

563
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:06,197
<i>Someone whose soul gets comfort
from chewing on pig's ear.</i>

564
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:12,001
If you think about it,
I think people are very cruel.

565
00:45:14,893 --> 00:45:17,791
Do you not like pork?
Are you vegetarian?

566
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:22,250
No, I think we should eat it well
for the pig who sacrificed itself.

567
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:32,061
Do you know how much it costs
for a night in that suite room?

568
00:45:33,492 --> 00:45:34,800
Around 1.2 million won?

569
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:39,911
With that money,
I can pay rent and monthly living costs.

570
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:43,701
I have to work every day as a maid
for a month to make that much.

571
00:45:45,681 --> 00:45:47,512
That's all you make?

572
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:51,759
They looked around our age.
You think they earned that money?

573
00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:54,014
I'm sure it was their parents' money.

574
00:45:54,014 --> 00:45:56,744
Yes, they act superior using money
that their parents gave them.

575
00:45:56,744 --> 00:45:59,364
Our nation's becoming more corrupt
because of people like that.

576
00:45:59,364 --> 00:46:01,735
It's people like us who suffer.

577
00:46:01,735 --> 00:46:03,512
How? How do we suffer?

578
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:07,143
They make you feel deprived and
you no longer want to work hard in life.

579
00:46:07,143 --> 00:46:10,414
They make you feel hopeless,
so that you don't have the will to live.

580
00:46:10,414 --> 00:46:14,061
Still, isn't it too much to say it's
a direct consequence of them?

581
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:17,539
You are so unaware of the real world.

582
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:21,202
We just got kicked out because of them.

583
00:46:22,585 --> 00:46:24,012
- That's true.
- You know...

584
00:46:24,012 --> 00:46:26,452
You will continue to get hurt
if you're this soft.

585
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:30,282
People who have nothing like us
need to have our heads on straight.

586
00:46:30,282 --> 00:46:32,402
This is Hell Joseon.

587
00:46:32,974 --> 00:46:35,847
<i>Hell Joseon? What's that?</i>

588
00:46:35,847 --> 00:46:38,244
<i>What is this combination
of Korean and English?</i>

589
00:46:38,244 --> 00:46:41,603
<i>A life where living expenses
equals your monthly pay.</i>

590
00:46:42,172 --> 00:46:44,282
<i>Is that why it's hell?</i>

591
00:46:44,282 --> 00:46:46,231
- Hurry up and eat.
- Okay.

592
00:46:57,036 --> 00:46:59,387
Bye. It was nice meeting you.

593
00:46:59,387 --> 00:47:01,545
Yeah. You too.

594
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:04,101
Right. You must not have bus money.

<i>[Gangsu Group's Second Son "B,"
Airplane Disturbance]</i>

596
00:47:19,612 --> 00:47:21,268
Here. Take this.

597
00:47:22,456 --> 00:47:23,552
By the way...

598
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:27,342
I have a favor to ask.

599
00:47:32,177 --> 00:47:33,498
Here he comes!

600
00:47:41,914 --> 00:47:44,978
Chairman, is it true your son
caused an airplane disturbance?

601
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:46,367
Where is he right now?

602
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:47,755
Please move!

603
00:47:47,755 --> 00:47:50,088
- Please move!
- Chairman, give us a comment.

604
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:04,494
Chairman, Chairman!

605
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:08,896
Chairman, one comment please!

606
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,148
Sorry, Father.

607
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:16,840
Where is Hyuk now?

608
00:48:18,634 --> 00:48:21,157
Catch him now and bring him to me.

609
00:48:21,934 --> 00:48:23,313
Right now!

610
00:48:23,313 --> 00:48:24,670
Yes, CEO Byun.

611
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:42,998
Gosh, where is he?

612
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,670
Here you go.

613
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:47,315
Where were they?

614
00:48:47,315 --> 00:48:49,403
Still in his locker.

615
00:48:51,355 --> 00:48:54,496
Then, are you saying
he disappeared in his swim trunks?

616
00:48:57,235 --> 00:49:01,132
I don't see him leaving
after he enters the spa.

617
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:05,804
There's no way,
unless he died in the water.

618
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,617
- Take another look.
- Okay.

619
00:50:37,132 --> 00:50:38,672

Yes.

621
00:50:45,728 --> 00:50:47,797
What were you doing?

622
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:50,086
How could you let that news come out?

623
00:50:50,516 --> 00:50:52,036
Why is that my fault?

624
00:50:52,036 --> 00:50:54,987
If you took care of Young Master,
this wouldn't have happened.

625
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:58,563
I have been taking
better care of him than ever.

626
00:50:58,563 --> 00:51:00,666
He's not a child.
I can't watch him for 24 hours.

627
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:03,063
You should have done that if you had to.

628
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:06,561
Goodness, I'm ashamed
to see CEO Byun.

629
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:09,601
It's enough for me to do it,
so you don't need to act that way.

630
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:12,152
How is the Young Master? Is he okay?

631
00:51:13,492 --> 00:51:14,963
I'm looking for him now.

632
00:51:14,963 --> 00:51:16,076
Still?

633
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:18,844
Where could he be this late?

634
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:23,411
It's very cold out.
I hope he's not suffering.

635
00:51:23,913 --> 00:51:26,550
The Young Master
you care so much about, Father...

636
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:30,389
I'm sure he's doing perfectly fine,
so just take care of yourself.

637
00:51:36,572 --> 00:51:40,001
This kid... I guess work is hard.

638
00:51:42,416 --> 00:51:46,193
Still, we're both living this well
because of CEO Byun.

639
00:51:46,193 --> 00:51:47,809
He should be grateful.

640
00:51:49,034 --> 00:51:50,106
That rascal.

641
00:51:56,748 --> 00:51:58,659
Gosh, that kid.

Oh, come here.

646
00:52:23,717 --> 00:52:25,608
Did you have fun playing, Hyuk?

647
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:26,632
Yes.

648
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:29,945
- Hold on, Sir.
- What?

649
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:33,740
What is it?

650
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:39,487

651
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,431
All right. Let's go inside.

00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:52,945
Bye, Jae Hoon. See you later.

653
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,864
My son is so good.

654
00:52:57,244 --> 00:52:59,934
Did you have a good day too, Son?

655
00:52:59,934 --> 00:53:02,586
Should we have ribs or bulgogi?

656
00:53:02,586 --> 00:53:05,277
- Ribs!
- Sounds good.

00:53:05,826 --> 00:53:07,467

00:53:12,184 --> 00:53:14,576

a thorn in my side.</i>

660
00:53:15,034 --> 00:53:18,635
<i>However, he was someone I couldn't
let go of, the elevator to my life.</i>

661
00:53:18,635 --> 00:53:20,989
No, Jae Hoon didn't do anything wrong.

662
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:25,527

668
00:54:03,737 --> 00:54:05,719
I don't think that sounds right.

669
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:07,702
How frustrated
do you think I was with him?

670
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:11,762
I came here for a talisman
for him to stop getting into trouble.

671
00:54:11,762 --> 00:54:14,126
Why would you get a talisman
to get in his way?

672
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,181
Those are all necessary steps
to becoming great.

673
00:54:16,181 --> 00:54:19,016
Einstein was told he had a
learning disability when he young.

674
00:54:19,016 --> 00:54:21,744
Edison was a troublesome child
who got suspended.

Oh my word.

677
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:28,893
Jobs did drugs?

678
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,927
He has the Um and Yang and
the five elements inside of him.

679
00:54:32,927 --> 00:54:36,237
He has the blessing
of people, money, and food.

680
00:54:36,237 --> 00:54:39,056
You need not worry at all.

681
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,027
How do I convince him?

682
00:54:52,617 --> 00:54:56,750
I need to bring it up well in the
beginning so he can't refuse.

683
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:02,619
Honestly, it's more likely he’ll say no.

684
00:55:02,621 --> 00:55:04,594
He's very cold and rude.

685
00:55:04,594 --> 00:55:07,420
I'll ask since you're in a bad position.

686
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,614
Don't have high expectations.

00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:13,782
Of course.

689

It costs 7,000 won,
but I'll charge you 6,000 won.

690
00:55:16,849 --> 00:55:18,619
I'll pay you back once I get my wallet.

691
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:22,371
Don't forget that
staying the night costs 30,000 won.

Hey, don't be that way and
just let him stay one night.

695
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:38,791
Huh? Huh?

696
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:41,710
He has no money at all,
so has nowhere to go tonight.

697
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:44,900
It's cold tonight.
How can I leave him on the street?

698
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,360
I don't know why I should let a person
I don't know in my house.

00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:55,335
For the common good of all,
you could share your space.

700
00:55:55,335 --> 00:55:56,664
No.

701
00:55:56,664 --> 00:56:00,079
Kwon Jae Hoon,
why are you such a bad person?

702
00:56:05,413 --> 00:56:07,971
Oh, help! Help me!

703
00:56:07,971 --> 00:56:09,300
What? What is it?

704
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:13,277
What? What is it?

705
00:56:13,277 --> 00:56:14,925
It's a rat. A rat!

706
00:56:14,925 --> 00:56:18,382
A rat. It's totally a rat!

707
00:56:22,407 --> 00:56:23,677
What is this?

708
00:56:23,677 --> 00:56:26,806
Ah, it's that person I told you about.

709
00:56:26,806 --> 00:56:29,425
My comrade who
got fired from the hotel with me.

710
00:56:29,425 --> 00:56:31,056
What? Comrade?

711
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:32,577
Nice to meet you.

712
00:56:33,114 --> 00:56:34,739
Nice meeting me?

713
00:56:36,277 --> 00:56:38,264
I told you he's a little cold.

714
00:56:39,108 --> 00:56:42,086
Yes, yes. I understand.

715
00:56:46,422 --> 00:56:49,356
Just let him stay one night.

716
00:56:49,356 --> 00:56:53,235
If you don't let him stay,
I'll have to let him stay with me.

717
00:56:53,235 --> 00:56:55,251
- What?
- Really?

718
00:56:55,251 --> 00:56:59,184
I can't do that now.
We are male and female, after all.

719
00:57:03,759 --> 00:57:05,311
He'll pay to stay the night.

720
00:57:05,311 --> 00:57:07,371
We can split it in half, okay?

721
00:57:09,442 --> 00:57:13,150
He may appear this way on the outside,
but his heart is as wide as the ocean.

722
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,130
- He looks nice.
- Of course, he is.

723
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:18,405
I feel bad for him. Just one night.

724
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,076
No, no.

725
00:57:26,103 --> 00:57:27,507
What happened with you?

726
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:30,367
There was a misunderstanding because
of my clothes, as you can see.

727
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,746
They kicked me out without my phone,
so I couldn't even call you.

728
00:57:33,746 --> 00:57:36,376
Yes, but how did you end up here?

729
00:57:36,376 --> 00:57:40,228
I know! We must be destined.

730
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:46,423
Wow, so this is what
your room looks like.

731
00:57:46,423 --> 00:57:47,570
Wow.

732
00:57:54,677 --> 00:57:56,710
Get up. Go home right now.

733
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:58,498
No. I can't go.

734
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:01,601
Didn't you see the news?

735
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:04,021
That's why I can't go.

736
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:07,492
You need to turn yourself in.
We can't cover it up anymore.

737
00:58:07,492 --> 00:58:09,882
That's what the CEO wants too.

738
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,186
Jae Hoon.

739
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:19,420
Chae Ri was cheating on me
with my friend, Sung Kyu.

740
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:21,659
I saw them together at the hotel.

741
00:58:24,231 --> 00:58:26,398
Honestly, today's been a really hard day.

742
00:58:26,398 --> 00:58:29,188
I just want to lie back
and rest for one day.

743
00:58:30,168 --> 00:58:33,728
Can't you console me
for today, as a friend?

744
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:38,333
You really are the worst.

745
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,773
Do you know the chaos
you've caused at the company?

746
00:58:41,005 --> 00:58:44,217
And you're having a hard time because
your girlfriend cheated on you?

747
00:58:47,615 --> 00:58:49,532
It's my last night.

748
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:51,460
What?

749
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,360
If I turn myself in tomorrow,
I'll be in jail.

750
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,974
So, it's my last night.

751
00:59:01,043 --> 00:59:03,851
Stay with me, my friend.

752
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:04,971
My friend.
(In French)

753
00:59:04,971 --> 00:59:06,862
My friend.
(In Japanese)

<i>[Two-Year Savings Account Matures]</i>

755
00:59:18,407 --> 00:59:22,293
All because of that terrible girl,
I'm going to miss my goal.

756
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:26,123
It was the best part-time job
where I earned the most.

757
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:31,396
What will I fill that with?

758
00:59:48,762 --> 00:59:50,760
They didn't care about
the rights of employees

759
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,572
and treated us like we're nothing.

760
00:59:52,572 --> 00:59:55,744
I was so disgusted
that I just quit right there.

761
00:59:55,744 --> 00:59:57,489
I did well, right?

762
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:02,967
If I were loyal
and stayed with the hotel...

763
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:05,862
I would have been hurt
like you were, Dad.

764
01:00:05,862 --> 01:00:10,804
Dad... you understand why I don't
want to work full-time anywhere, right?

765
01:00:18,552 --> 01:00:19,610
Sleep here.

766
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:22,239
Can't I sleep on the bed with you?
My back hurts.

767
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:24,429
No, you can't.

768
01:00:38,795 --> 01:00:40,822
What is Joon like anyway?

769
01:00:40,822 --> 01:00:42,753
She's not ordinary from what I can tell.

770
01:00:42,753 --> 01:00:44,244
What do you mean?

771
01:00:44,244 --> 01:00:46,934
She only works part-time jobs
and she's immature.

772
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,411
She's very cool.

773
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:51,132
She saved my life.
She's like a guiding light.

774
01:00:51,132 --> 01:00:52,286
What are you saying?

775
01:00:52,286 --> 01:00:55,715
If it weren't for her,
I could've starved to death.

776
01:00:55,715 --> 01:00:59,221
She was the first person
to treat me so kindly.

777
01:00:59,221 --> 01:01:00,858
It's because
she can't mind her own business.

778
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:02,574
I want to pay Joon back.

779
01:01:03,306 --> 01:01:04,588
Did you borrow money too?

780
01:01:04,588 --> 01:01:07,507
For the room and three bowls
of ramen, 49,000 won.

781
01:01:08,117 --> 01:01:11,655
She sold ramen and rented a room
to a guy she doesn't even know.

782
01:01:13,219 --> 01:01:15,099
Joon is so absurd.

783
01:01:16,378 --> 01:01:18,898
- Get down.
- Ow.

784
01:01:24,818 --> 01:01:28,719
Being unable to afford one meal was
the thing that made me feel the worst.

785
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,280
I felt so pathetic
because I didn't have it.

786
01:01:33,018 --> 01:01:35,858
My pride was hurt and I felt so low.

787
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,630
Did you just find that out now?

788
01:01:38,398 --> 01:01:44,068
I realized that I was a stupid fool
who couldn't even earn 10,000 won myself.

789
01:01:47,467 --> 01:01:51,304
In return for obeying my father,
who's like the king...

790
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,378
I'm giving him that privilege and right.

791
01:01:56,215 --> 01:01:57,672
I think I know.

792
01:02:01,257 --> 01:02:03,512
What happened to you?

793
01:02:05,498 --> 01:02:08,239
But Joon doesn't obey others.

794
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:10,030
Forget about a king.

795
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:14,134
She won't sell her self-respect and pride
for money and she just walked out.

796
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:16,260
It was totally awesome.

797
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,769
You really should have seen it.

798
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:21,431
I see she let her temper
get the best of her again.

799
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,983
How long have you known Joon?

800
01:02:26,983 --> 01:02:28,646
Have you lived here with her a long time?

801
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:32,567
You don't need to know.
Mind your own business.

802
01:02:56,179 --> 01:02:57,739
Did you not hear me?

803
01:03:04,016 --> 01:03:06,956
I... like you.

804
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:11,273
I like you... I like you... I like you.

805
01:03:22,324 --> 01:03:23,980
So, what?

806
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,672
What am I supposed to do?

807
01:03:51,534 --> 01:03:53,893
It's making me angrier
the more I think about it.

808
01:03:53,893 --> 01:03:57,170
A person's value is
determined by the work that they do?

809
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:02,889
Kwon Jae Hoon, you're just like that rude
girl and the manager who chased me out.

810
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:08,420
You stupid lackey!

811
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:18,143
I... like you.

812
01:04:20,092 --> 01:04:22,788
<i>I like you... I like you... I like you.</i>

813
01:04:26,251 --> 01:04:27,632
How close are you?

814
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:33,715
You're not dating, are you?

815
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:36,552
What?

816
01:04:38,036 --> 01:04:40,070
Don't be ridiculous and sleep.

817
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:41,802
Right? You're not!

818
01:04:41,802 --> 01:04:44,019
Yeah, there's no way.

819
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:53,512
But... why are you asking
if we're dating or not?

820
01:04:53,512 --> 01:04:56,663
- You're not--
- I think Joon likes me.

821
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,534
What?

822
01:04:58,534 --> 01:05:00,985
Why else would she be so good to me?

823
01:05:00,985 --> 01:05:02,934
She took care of me a lot.

824
01:05:02,934 --> 01:05:06,373
She took me around all day,
gave me rides, and fed me.

825
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:08,293
She even found me a place to sleep.

826
01:05:08,293 --> 01:05:10,365
I'm telling you, she likes me.

827
01:05:10,623 --> 01:05:12,601
I'm popular wherever I go.

828
01:05:15,257 --> 01:05:20,942
You need to wake up early tomorrow
to turn yourself in, so sleep, okay?

829
01:05:23,597 --> 01:05:27,898
Take good care of her
while I'm gone, Jae Hoon.

830
01:05:32,438 --> 01:05:34,317
By the way, what's Hell Joseon?

831
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,713
Who are you speaking so rudely to?

832
01:06:13,485 --> 01:06:15,485
Thinking about it...

833
01:06:17,195 --> 01:06:19,731
I think I'm in love with her.

834
01:06:22,389 --> 01:06:28,297
All the loves I've had so far...
they were just practice.

835
01:06:38,317 --> 01:06:40,469
The girl I'm destined to meet...

836
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:44,507
I think I finally met her.
