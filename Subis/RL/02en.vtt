You know good food.
Do you want some more?

You two are still speaking
formally to each another?

21

Oh, Jae Hoon here isn't very outgoing.

22
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:25,087
You should put away your blankets if
I allowed you to stay the night.

23
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:27,155
Of course, my friend.

24
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:28,983
First, let me have some rice.

Joon, the thing is...

38
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:17,902
I guess you'll be busy again taking
care this rich reckless troublemaker.

<i>Why am I?</i>

41
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:24,792
If he was born with
a silver spoon in his mouth

42
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,741
he should be thankful and live quietly.

43
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,353
Where does he get off acting
high and mighty with money?

44
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:33,188
People like this need to be erased
from the world. They're just evil.

45
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:37,706

I'd like to call the stations

49
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:50,925
I'll hold myself back
because I'm very busy with work.

50

You can do it if you want.

51

She called me a troublemaker.

59
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:34,007
Not just reckless, but a troublemaker.

60
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,781
How can she be so mistaken?

61
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:42,685
This won't do. I need to fix this.

62
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:45,956
I need to fix this terrible
misunderstanding between me and Joon.

63
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:48,225
I have made a decision, my friend.

64

- What decision?
- I'm going to go.

65
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:56,629
I'll fix this confusing misunderstanding.

Don't get involved, don't start trouble.

No, I've finally met my destiny.

69

I can't let her think

00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:42,684
am I someone who can't
do anything on my own?

177
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:47,192
Take this.

178
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,486
They might track
your phone, so turn it off.

179
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,437
Let's go.

180
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,139
Get out, get out, get out.

181
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,590
I told you to go!

182
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,831
Hurry up and get out!

183
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:12,341
I told you, it's good for hangovers.

184
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:14,490
You said it was good for stamina before.

185
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,692
It's good for stamina and hangovers.

186
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:18,274
I don't want it either way.

187
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:20,879
I'm busy so get out. Go, go!

188
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,744
If you don't want it, that's fine.
No need to be like this.

189
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:27,505
Don't be this way.
Just try it for one month.

190
00:15:27,505 --> 00:15:30,019
I told you I don't want it.
Take it and get out!

191
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:32,980
You drank all the free ones
I gave you to try last week.

192
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,259
You enjoyed the free ones.

193
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:37,552
Do you take me for a fool?

194
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:41,149
Hey, Smoothie.
You forcefully gave them to me.

195
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,946
Now, you're trying strong-arm me?

196
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:45,365
- Section Chief.
- Seriously...

197
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:56,778
It's fine if you don't want it.

198
00:15:56,778 --> 00:15:59,634
How could you throw it all on the ground?

199
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:01,063
These are for drinking.

200
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:03,576
Hey, Manager Kim! Call security.

201
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,765
Get this woman out of here now.

202
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,466
This is so annoying,
early in the morning.

203
00:16:14,284 --> 00:16:16,414
Ah, don't let it get to you.

204
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:19,009
Don't let it get to you, Baek Joon.

205
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,519
Hey, Hyuk.

206
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:30,821
What do I with these?

207
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:36,048
Oh, thank you.

208
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:44,668
Oh, Hyuk!

209
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:48,495
How... what are you doing here?

210
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:49,653
Wait.

211
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:55,381
Hey... huh?

212
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,504
Oh...

213
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:15,521
Gosh, seriously... who are you?

214
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:19,818
Oh!

215
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:23,047
Yes, that's right. Oh... it's me.

216
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:25,917
How... how did you end up here?

217
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:29,426
You don't need to know that.
Why don't you just drink it?

218
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:31,096
How much could it cost in a month?

219
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:36,294
For a person trying to make a living
and smiling while doing it...

220
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:38,496
there's nothing
more important than health.

221
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:41,653
Yes, yes! Ah, yes.

222
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:45,517
If you really don't have
the money for it...

223
00:17:45,517 --> 00:17:48,153
talk to your team manager,
Kwon, about it.

224
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:51,449
Yes, I understand.

225
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:53,911
I'm sorry, Section Chief.

226
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:56,586
Are you crazy? Let's go.

227
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:58,067
I'm sorry.

228
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,020
Joon!

229
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,486
Hey, you! You, you... hey.

230
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:14,747
<i>[CEO's troublemaker son,
Byun Hyuk, is in the office.]</i>

231
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:17,484
<i>[CEO's troublemaker son,
Byun Hyuk, is in the office.]</i>

232
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:23,826
Please don't post things like this
online, Section Chief Gong.

233
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:27,394
The company atmosphere
is already quite hectic.

234
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:42,602
What are you doing?

235
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:45,542
We're trying to make sales,
not force them into it.

236
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,803
What do you mean force?

237
00:18:46,803 --> 00:18:50,037
I was only trying to make him
understand as a human being.

238
00:18:50,037 --> 00:18:52,018
It looked like you were pressuring him.

239
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:55,256
Anyway, that's not how you do sales.

240
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:01,311
Hey... what's wrong with your face?

241
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:03,463
- Did you get hit?
- Yeah.

242
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:07,778
Just a bit.

243
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:09,993
Tell me the truth.

244
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:11,551
Why did you come here?

245
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:15,788
The thing about that is, Joon...

246
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:20,010
To tell you the truth,
my father works here.

247
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,785
Where? Which department?

248
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:25,720
Not any department in particular,
but the entire company really.

249
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,626
- Is he a laborer?
- Huh?

250
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,803
Like janitorial or security?

251
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,479
- Security?
- Oh...

252
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:35,820
So, he works in security.

253
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:42,463
If you came to see your father,
why did you get hit like that?

254
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,476
Oh, because of what happened yesterday...

255
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,173
He got very angry because you got
fired from the hotel, right?

256
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:49,854
- Huh?
- I see.

257
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:52,424
It's not easy to get a job
like that these days.

258
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,875
From your father's point of view,
I'm sure he's disappointed.

259
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,674
How angry was he that he hit
his son's face like this?

260
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:07,967
Well... I'm always the son
who disappoints him.

261
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:18,082
Yes?

262
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:20,123
You should get back to the hotel.

263
00:20:20,123 --> 00:20:22,188
All right.

264
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,266
I will.

265
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:35,060
I should get going.

266
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,301
Thanks, Joon.

267
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:42,911
- Hold on for now.
- What?

268
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:46,805
The police might come around.

269
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:49,099
It will be investigated
confidentially, so don't worry.

270
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:51,411
I've already talked it over with them.

271
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:56,211
By any chance... was this planned
by the prosecutor's office?

272
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:59,271
We would be in trouble
if this came out too.

273
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,592
Listen carefully.

274
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:05,584
Since the media knows about it,
we need to make it look good.

275
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:08,101
If the police find a case there,
it will have credibility.

276
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,546
It will depend, but there
could be an official investigation.

277
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:13,150
You have to make sure
that doesn't happen.

278
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:18,324
You have him, right?

279
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:23,131
Hide him well, so he doesn't get caught.

280
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:24,803
We can't control it if he shows up.

281
00:21:24,803 --> 00:21:27,799
Gangsu Group is not
the problem. We will be dead.

282
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,845
That's why it's not us, kid.

283
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:36,140
Then I'll assume that's true
and get going.

284
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,551
In my experience...

285
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:40,770
these things are usually
from someone on the inside.

286
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:45,919
Enemies are usually someone close by.

287
00:21:56,992 --> 00:22:00,432
Someone on the inside? What do you mean?

288
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:05,275
Do you still have that
original file that I gave you?

289
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:10,010
Of course, I put it in my safe
right after you gave it to me.

290
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,259
I'm certain about it so don't worry.

291
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:14,710
You should make sure that
that flight attendant stays quiet.

292
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,792
It will really be a pain if she starts
giving interviews, crying and so on.

293
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:20,963
I understand.

294
00:22:22,763 --> 00:22:25,624
Where is Hyuk now anyway?

295
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:32,005
He's probably at the hotel.

296
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:42,153
That's the new place
they're building. You see it?

297
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:45,193
Today's the first day,
so they'll be carrying bricks.

298
00:22:45,193 --> 00:22:46,403
There's lots to do.

299
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:47,957
- Don't worry. Let's go.
- Joon.

300
00:22:47,957 --> 00:22:49,688
- Oh, you're here.
- Joon!

301
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:51,778
- Is this him?
- Yes.

302
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:54,429
This is my friend, Byun Hyuk.

303
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:57,444
He's going through a difficult time.
Please help him out.

304
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:59,630
Joon, I don't know about this...

305
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,515
He's a little soft. Will he be okay?

306
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:09,068
What do you mean soft? It's all muscle.

307
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,589
I know he's soft,
but he's got a lot of spirit.

308
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:18,099
Please teach him well, okay?

309
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:22,746
- Joon, must I do this?
- All right, since it's you asking.

310
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:25,836
Hey, get over here Byun.

311
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:27,605
What do you mean Byun?

312
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:30,897
Yeah, what is that? Byun?

313
00:23:30,897 --> 00:23:33,397
Mister Byun, follow us.

314
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,236
- Byun...
- Joon!

315
00:23:38,236 --> 00:23:39,758
You can make 90,000 won a day.

316
00:23:39,758 --> 00:23:41,746
It's hard to find a job like this.

317
00:23:41,746 --> 00:23:43,945
Don't complain, just learn the job.

318
00:23:43,945 --> 00:23:45,155
See you later.

319
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:50,023
Joon!

320
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:53,945
Why are you standing there?
Go work to earn your meal.

321
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:55,905
Ma'am!

322
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:57,465
Hurry.

323
00:23:57,465 --> 00:24:00,175
Hurry, hurry. Get going.

324
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:05,654
You need to put more in there.

325
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:06,945
Put more.

326
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:10,672
Get going.

327
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,623
All right. Let's go.

328
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:17,003
You... you want me to carry this?

329
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:18,670
Who else would do it?

330
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,753
What are you doing? Hurry up.

331
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:23,583
Okay. Go.

332
00:24:25,522 --> 00:24:27,736
All right. Go!

333
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:29,065
Oh, oh. Wait.

334
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:32,496
All right. Let's go!

335
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:37,118
Mister Byun, hurry it up.

336
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:38,465
Ouch.

337
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:50,857
Hey, Byun. Get over here.

338
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:51,896
I can't do it.

339
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:53,142
What do you mean you can't?

340
00:24:53,142 --> 00:24:54,586
Byun Hyuk!

341
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:57,926
Keep it up!

342
00:24:57,926 --> 00:24:59,618
Stay strong! Woohoo!

343
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:01,647
Woo!

344
00:25:06,653 --> 00:25:09,304
Ah... I think I'm going crazy.

345
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:16,336
Hello.

346
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,015
Where are you?
Are you at the hotel?

347
00:25:21,015 --> 00:25:22,777
Jae Hoon, please save me.

348
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:25,695
- What are you talking about?
- This is hell.

349
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:28,590
I followed Joon and now I'm
trapped in a part-time job.

350
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,710
What? Who did you follow?

351
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,038
Why would you follow Joon?

352
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:37,018
Please, Jae Hoon. Please save me.

353
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:38,892
I'm scared and hungry.

354
00:25:38,892 --> 00:25:41,625
You rascal.

355
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,734
Why are you hitting me?

356
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:46,025
Hello... hello?

357
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:53,923
He's not picking up.

358
00:25:57,988 --> 00:26:01,015
<i>This caller cannot take your call.</i>

359
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,327
Hey, this is your life around here.

360
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:09,039
You can't just take it off like that.

361
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,397
Put it back on now.

362
00:26:10,397 --> 00:26:12,445
Why are you doing this to me, Mister?

363
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,666
Why do you think?
I'm taking care of Joon's friend.

364
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:17,873
You fool around every chance you get.

365
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:19,001
Where's Joon?

366
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:21,692
Where do you think?
She's working hard.

367
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:30,915
<i>Oh my goodness.</i>

368
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:32,755
<i>That enchanting figure.</i>

369
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:35,163
<i>Every movement filled with passion.</i>

370
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:38,324
<i>A natural grace waiting to explode.</i>

371
00:26:38,324 --> 00:26:40,015
<i>Oh, Joon.</i>

372
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,266
<i>You are beautiful
no matter what you are doing.</i>

373
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:48,586
Hey, hey, hey.
You're drooling.

374
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:51,046
Wipe your drool and follow me.

375
00:26:51,046 --> 00:26:52,968
What are you doing?

376
00:26:52,968 --> 00:26:54,787
Have you seen the news?

377
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,538
I came because of the video leak.

378
00:26:56,538 --> 00:26:57,675
Are you...

379
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:01,488
suspicious of me right now?

380
00:27:01,488 --> 00:27:03,828
You just saw me get off the plane.

381
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:05,297
I wasn't even in the country.

382
00:27:05,297 --> 00:27:07,926
You could've given it to someone else.

383
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,939
You really are just too much.

384
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:13,733
I'm the victim.

385
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:17,627
You people didn't take care of it and
now you're coming to threaten the victim?

386
00:27:17,627 --> 00:27:20,887
I hope you understand why I would
have to come talk to you.

387
00:27:20,887 --> 00:27:22,659
I'm doing my best to forget it.

388
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:27,807
If you continue to come
looking for me regarding this...

389
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:31,387
I might forget about this settlement.

390
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:34,969
I hope I don't need to see
your face in the future.

391
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,598
Someone from the media might contact you.

392
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,626
Don't ever agree to an interview.

393
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:53,749
Keep this a secret from your co-workers
and the people around you.

394
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:58,170
If you break the contract,
we can breach this settlement, as well.

395
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,198
Goodbye.

396
00:28:16,316 --> 00:28:17,519
Good job.

397
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,568
Good job, young man.

398
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:22,743
Good work.

399
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:26,141
You should put some
muscle-healing pads on him.

400
00:28:26,141 --> 00:28:27,868
You're the one who suffered, Mister.

401
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:29,775
Yeah, I guess.

402
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,382
Hey, you're a young man.

403
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:35,544
You need more strength.

404
00:28:35,544 --> 00:28:37,232
- Goodbye.
- Yeah.

405
00:28:45,144 --> 00:28:48,460
Ta-da! Today's pay, 90,000 won.

406
00:28:51,226 --> 00:28:54,273
10,000 won is for the lunch
you had earlier.

407
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:57,056
20,000 won is for the shovel
you broke today.

408
00:28:57,056 --> 00:29:00,153
For the ramen yesterday, I'll give you
a discount since you suffered.

409
00:29:00,153 --> 00:29:04,955
Breakfast was 4,500 won, and tomorrow's
breakfast will be 20,000 won.

410
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:06,530
Here. Good work.

411
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:16,323
40,000 won.

412
00:29:18,153 --> 00:29:19,873
Just to earn this...

413
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:47,721
You don't need to call your dad?

414
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:53,109
He must feel bad
after hitting you like that.

415
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:55,167
I told you.

416
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:59,170
No news is good news
when it comes to me and my father.

417
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,906
I don't know what the issue is.

418
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:04,530
You should still be good
to him while he's around.

419
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,547
It'll be too late once he passes away.

420
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,486
What was your father like?

421
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:13,656
My dad?

422
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:20,316
He was a normal man.

423
00:30:22,246 --> 00:30:25,686
He was kind and warm.

424
00:30:25,686 --> 00:30:29,288
He was loving and sensitive.

425
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,671
So, my mom found him
a little bit frustrating.

426
00:30:31,671 --> 00:30:33,458
He was the best dad to me.

427
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:37,280
If I think about it now...

428
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,612
I think he got hurt by the world
a lot because he had so much love.

429
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:47,471
- So, I...
- Wait, stop!

430
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:49,920
What is it?

431
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:55,901
You were about step on
the dandelion seed flower.

432
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,230
Wait.

433
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,279
Here we go.

434
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:44,170
Whenever I see the dandelion seeds,
I want to let them fly.

435
00:31:45,711 --> 00:31:49,830
It's like a wounded soul
is flying free somewhere.

436
00:31:51,532 --> 00:31:55,871
If they can find root
somewhere new and live there...

437
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:58,540
they can forget their past bad memories.

438
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:29,303
Oh, Jae Hoon.

439
00:32:29,303 --> 00:32:31,923
Oh, my friend Jae Hoon.

440
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:36,750
I guess he's coming home from work.

441
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,800
What are you doing here?
You didn't go home?

442
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,459
Oh, the thing is...

443
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:49,300
He started working a job
with me today. 90,000 won a day.

444
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,500
Yes, 90,000 won a day.

445
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:54,780
So, that's why I want to ask...

446
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,630
can he stay with you
until he gets his own place?

447
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,409
Can I, Jae Hoon, my friend?

448
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:03,789
No, just go back to where you belong.

449
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:07,730
If you don't want to,
then he can stay at my place.

450
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,374
- Really?
- Are you crazy?

451
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:12,122
I can go sleep downstairs at my
friend's place on the third floor.

452
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,981
But, it'll be 15,000 won a night.
What do you think?

453
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:17,786
I'll pay for two nights.

454
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:25,451
Sounds good.

455
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:27,333
That's good.

456
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:28,875
Let's go, Joon.

457
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,270
Let's go!

458
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:35,376
What? I paid already.

459
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:38,526
What is your problem?
I'm going up to Joon's to sleep.

460
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:40,448
I paid 30,000 won.

461
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:42,601
Geez.

462
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:45,413
Be quiet. Shut your mouth
and and go to bed here.

463
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:47,832
Joon... Joon!

464
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:49,521
- Joon!
- Hey.

465
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:52,432
What? What? My 30,000 won.

466
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,794
My 30,000 won.

467
00:33:57,721 --> 00:33:58,897
Joon.

468
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,071
Joon!

469
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:14,050
<i>[Mom] </i>

470
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:17,650
<i>[Mom] </i>

471
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,242
<i>[Mom] </i>

472
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:14,418
Oh my.

473
00:35:16,588 --> 00:35:17,981
Oh, you scared me.

474
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,918
What is this? Ha Yeon Hee.

475
00:35:25,018 --> 00:35:26,166
It's me.

476
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:29,233
Look at you just drinking
soju with no food.

477
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,757
You should've called if you were here.

478
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:34,521
It's not right of you
to drink without me.

479
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:37,177
I wouldn't do that.

480
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:40,418
This one is for our pretty Joon.

481
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:42,443
Thank you very much.

482
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:46,181
What is it? Something's wrong, huh?

483
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:48,327
Joon.

484
00:35:49,806 --> 00:35:51,436
Have you seen the news?

485
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:55,509
Third generation rich guy,
airplane disturbance.

486
00:35:57,382 --> 00:35:59,105
It can't be...

487
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:01,760
That flight attendant
whose face is blurred out.

488
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,023
That person is...

489
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:07,289
me.

490
00:36:10,438 --> 00:36:11,929
What... what?

491
00:36:16,414 --> 00:36:17,759
My friend.

492
00:36:19,168 --> 00:36:20,570
You see this money here?

493
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:26,722
It's the first money I earned
shedding blood and tears.

494
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,527
I don't think I'll ever
be able to spend this.

495
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,032
My lucky 10,000 won.

496
00:36:36,813 --> 00:36:38,806
I'll save it as a keepsake.

497
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,842
Go ahead and do that.

498
00:36:42,842 --> 00:36:46,210
You won't ever have to do
hard labor to make money again.

499
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,719
Do you know?

500
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:54,489
Most people can't keep money
as a keepsake after earning it.

501
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:57,996
They need to eat when they're hungry
and they need shelter to rest in.

502
00:36:57,996 --> 00:37:00,838
A life where income
and spending is equal.

503
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:08,726
Yes! Hell Joseon.

504
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:13,518
I feel like Neo,
who just took the red pill.

505
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:15,677
What are you saying?

506
00:37:15,677 --> 00:37:18,606
The matrix I've been living in
has been shattered.

507
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:23,295
The woman who gave me the drug
showing me the truth is my destiny.

508
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:26,358
I really can't just go to sleep.

509
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:28,025
I need to go have a drink with Joon.

510
00:37:28,025 --> 00:37:30,407
Can I buy some pork belly
with 10,000 won?

511
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:31,777
No. Just sleep.

512
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:33,135
Look here, friend.

513
00:37:33,135 --> 00:37:36,579
99 percent of you
is a very excellent friend.

514
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:38,920
However, the one percent
bad part is so strong.

515
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,322
You're so stubborn and hard-headed.

516
00:37:41,322 --> 00:37:42,777
Give it a rest and sleep.

517
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:44,409
Don't stop me, friend.

518
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,581
Just one drink, Joon.

519
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:49,681
Joon!

520
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,619
Hey, stop right there.

521
00:37:52,976 --> 00:37:54,873
<i>[Settlement - Kwon Jae Hoon]</i>

522
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:57,635
You know, I really...

523
00:37:57,635 --> 00:38:00,594
didn't want to sign
this kind of contract.

524
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:05,804
But, all the higher-up people
ended up settling.

525
00:38:05,804 --> 00:38:10,105
They were all just
telling me to do as I was told.

526
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:15,193
You're telling me it was
this guy, Kwon Jae Hoon?

527
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:17,844
The thin guy who looks
like this, Kwon Jae Hoon?

528
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:20,742
Yes and it was fine up until there.

529
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:24,262
Then he showed up
today and threatened me.

530
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:29,353
He asked me if it I was
the one who leaked the video.

531
00:38:29,353 --> 00:38:31,590
This jerk is trash!

532
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,289
Does that make sense?

533
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:38,445
Who would leak a video of herself
getting sexually harassed?

534
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:40,375
What kind of psycho would do that?

535
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:42,143
No one would do that.

536
00:38:42,143 --> 00:38:45,737
I... I... will go and kill him.

537
00:38:47,168 --> 00:38:49,394
Joon! Joon!

538
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:51,623
Joon!

539
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:54,829
Let's have a drink.

540
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:56,079
Hyuk, I...

541
00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:50,121
You punk!

542
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,987
No, this is all a misunderstanding.

543
00:39:55,713 --> 00:39:57,536
Why did you do that? Why there?

544
00:39:57,536 --> 00:39:58,661
You!

545
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,501
You... you...

546
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,782
- You...
- What is it, Yeon Hee?

547
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,603
This is the guy.

548
00:40:08,603 --> 00:40:09,628
Huh?

549
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:11,682
This is that jerk!

550
00:40:11,682 --> 00:40:14,425
That reckless trouble-making
third generation son of Gangsu.

551
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:21,181
<i>[Third generation son of Gangsu]</i>

552
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,251
<i>[Third generation son of Gangsu]</i>

553
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:28,692
No! I'm not him.

554
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:31,532
Jae Hoon, tell her I'm not him.

555
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:34,461
You're not him? You're not?

556
00:40:36,152 --> 00:40:37,302
You're not?

557
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:43,351
You're really that
third generation son of the Gangsu?

558
00:40:43,351 --> 00:40:45,423
No, no. Joon, I'm not.

559
00:40:45,423 --> 00:40:49,882
It is him.

560
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:53,920
It is him. I'm right.

561
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,494
It's all a misunderstanding,
Joon. It really is.

562
00:40:57,494 --> 00:41:01,806
Shut your mouth,
you dandelion bastard jerk!

563
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:12,994
Oh my goodness!

564
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,634
Oh, Hyuk.

565
00:41:21,634 --> 00:41:22,976
What is it?

566
00:41:24,297 --> 00:41:27,338
Honey, our Hyuk...

567
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:29,036
In my dream, Hyuk...

568
00:41:29,036 --> 00:41:31,367
It was just a crazy dream.

569
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:32,777
Go back to sleep.

570
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:36,536
This won't do.

571
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:39,860
I need to go to see my spiritual guide
and ask him to look after Hyuk.

572
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,289
I told you not to bring him up.

573
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,960
Kwon Jae Hoon.

574
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,744
Is this the son of that CEO you work for?

575
00:41:54,923 --> 00:41:56,307
Joon.

576
00:41:56,307 --> 00:41:57,657
Tell me now.

577
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:00,476
That's right.

578
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,326
Hyuk is that Byun Hyuk.

579
00:42:05,496 --> 00:42:08,507
So, you two planned it to fool me.

580
00:42:08,507 --> 00:42:11,795
We never planned it
or tried to fool you, Joon.

581
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,710
"Nice to meet you."

582
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,141
You used formal speech
to each other in front of me.

583
00:42:16,141 --> 00:42:17,836
That's not planning?

584
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:20,947
Don't get upset. Calm down, Joon.

585
00:42:20,947 --> 00:42:24,405
This all started from a small
misunderstanding.

586
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:27,766
It was when you thought
I was a hotel employee.

587
00:42:27,766 --> 00:42:31,516
Right, you've been
lying to me since then.

588
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:34,945
You pretended to be a poor
hotel employee who got fired.

589
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:38,077
Yeah, did you have fun
playing me like that?

590
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:39,655
Did you have fun?

591
00:42:39,655 --> 00:42:43,266
All I did was let him
sleep over when you brought him over.

592
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:45,876
What did you two say when we
watched the news together?

593
00:42:45,876 --> 00:42:49,195
- That's because...
- That's because...

594
00:42:49,195 --> 00:42:52,204
You were criticizing me
so much after watching the news.

595
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:53,876
Criticizing?

596
00:42:53,876 --> 00:42:56,992
You said I was a reckless troublemaker
and evil that needed to be erased.

597
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,684
Well, aren't you?

598
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:00,269
I'm not that bad, Joon.

599
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:01,925
I'm not that reckless of a troublemaker.

600
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:08,579
You're all dead now.

601
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:11,349
I don't think I can stand by any longer.

602
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:14,789
Hey... what kind of people are you?

603
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:16,855
Yeon Hee, why don't you put this down?

604
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:17,889
Move.

605
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:19,891
Yes, you could hurt yourself.

606
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:21,192
Please calm down.

607
00:43:21,192 --> 00:43:23,487
I'm already hurt!

608
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:25,398
Forget it.
Both of you, get on your knees.

609
00:43:25,398 --> 00:43:26,416
- What?
- What?

610
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:29,083
Get on your knees and apologize.

611
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:31,280
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

612
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,340
Why should I?

613
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,239
I didn't do anything wrong,
so why should I?

614
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,545
We should save people's lives first.

615
00:43:38,545 --> 00:43:40,655
The person who was wrong apologized.

616
00:43:40,655 --> 00:43:43,539
All I did was write the settlement
on behalf of another person.

617
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:46,427
You just did what
you were told, is that it?

618
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:53,527
Yeon Hee!

619
00:43:58,201 --> 00:44:00,628
You can keep this piece of paper.

620
00:44:00,628 --> 00:44:02,789
You took the settlement money.
You can't act this way.

621
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:04,744
Hey! Hey!

622
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:14,994
Take all your money too.
I don't need any of it.

623
00:44:14,994 --> 00:44:17,130
Take it back. Take it all back.

624
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,967
You bastards!

625
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:21,887
You should never have accepted it.
Why are you causing a fuss now?

626
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,996
Kwon Jae Hoon, shut your mouth now.

627
00:44:30,246 --> 00:44:32,559
You punks. I'll call the police now.

628
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:34,052
- Joon.
- Do what you want.

629
00:44:34,052 --> 00:44:38,346
- Jae Hoon.
- You'll have to be investigated too.

630
00:44:38,346 --> 00:44:41,460
- Why?
- You'll have to explain why he was here.

631
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,266
I didn't know who he was.

632
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:44,719
You two lied to me.

633
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:46,568
That's not what I'll say.

634
00:44:46,568 --> 00:44:50,938
I'll say you knew from the beginning,
hid him, and you're an accomplice.

635
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,518
That's all I need to say.

636
00:44:53,518 --> 00:44:56,271
Wow, Kwon Jae Hoon. You're really petty.

637
00:44:56,271 --> 00:44:59,949
He accidentally touched her
and she got 10 million won.

638
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:01,983
Why would I get on my knees?

639
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:05,271
Hey, are you done
talking now? Stop right there!

640
00:45:05,271 --> 00:45:06,521
Jae Hoon!

641
00:45:15,342 --> 00:45:17,451
Yeon Hee... Yeon Hee.

642
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:21,483
Are you okay? What do I do?

643
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:23,478
What should we do?

644
00:45:23,478 --> 00:45:24,514
Should I carry her?

645
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:27,434
Get lost, you pervert!

646
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:29,240
Get out of here.

647
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,563
- Yeon Hee.
- Pervert?

648
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,902
Hey, friend.

649
00:45:39,284 --> 00:45:41,307
No matter what...

650
00:45:41,307 --> 00:45:45,487
weren't you going too far,
provoking Joon like that?

651
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:49,336
What if Joon still goes to the police?

652
00:45:51,568 --> 00:45:53,077
It's okay if they take me in.

653
00:45:53,077 --> 00:45:56,784
If I get arrested,
won't you be in trouble at work?

654
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:03,197
Even if there is trouble for me,
all they can do is discipline or fire me.

655
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:06,059
Jae Hoon, you don't mean that.

656
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:08,056
I do mean it.

657
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:13,353
All the trouble you cause, everything
you do wrong, even when you breathe...

658
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,925
I have to take
responsibility for all of it.

659
00:46:15,925 --> 00:46:17,755
I am so sick and tired of it.

660
00:46:20,056 --> 00:46:24,567
Now, I want to see what my life
would be like without you.

661
00:46:46,456 --> 00:46:47,608
Jae Hoon.

662
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:52,713
I know I've put you through a lot.

663
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:56,711
Still, we have to stick together
through the hard times.

664
00:46:58,338 --> 00:47:00,949
What am I supposed to do by myself?

665
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:01,996
Okay?

666
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:13,998
This is yours.

667
00:47:20,447 --> 00:47:22,777
This is so absurd. It really is.

668
00:47:25,847 --> 00:47:28,637
One is a pervert.

669
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:33,112
The other is a jerk
with no tears or blood.

670
00:47:33,112 --> 00:47:36,206
Those are my friends?

671
00:47:36,206 --> 00:47:37,416
Friends?

672
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:39,612
They aren't my friends.

673
00:47:45,588 --> 00:47:47,614
Those bastards!

674
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,170
Joon.

675
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,304
I didn't mean to lie to you.

676
00:48:01,304 --> 00:48:05,659
You said I was a reckless,
evil, troublemaker.

677
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:08,679
I lost my chance to tell you
who I really was. I'm really sorry.

678
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,597
Yes, I know it's all my fault.

679
00:48:15,597 --> 00:48:18,489
I'll accept all the blame.

680
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:23,289
One thing I really want to correct
is that you think I'm a pervert.

681
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:26,619
You saw earlier that I
slipped on the soju bottle.

682
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:30,849
The airplane incident
was because of turbulence too.

683
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:33,806
How dare you give me your cheap excuses?

684
00:48:33,806 --> 00:48:36,152
It's not an excuse. It's a fact.

685
00:48:36,152 --> 00:48:38,469
If you want to apologize,
do it to Yeon Hee.

686
00:48:38,469 --> 00:48:40,670
Until you do,
you'll forever be a pervert to me.

687
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:44,851
Until you forgive me...

688
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:49,780
I won't take one step out of here.

689
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,760
Do whatever you want.

690
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,697
Joon, what happened to that
radiant humanism of yours?

691
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:03,076
Joon.

692
00:49:05,074 --> 00:49:06,657
Joon?

693
00:49:07,914 --> 00:49:11,179
Joon!

694
00:49:12,748 --> 00:49:13,934
Oh, it's cold.

695
00:49:23,436 --> 00:49:25,505
Misunderstanding, yeah right!

696
00:49:41,588 --> 00:49:42,588
<i>[Joon! Designated Driver]</i>

697
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:57,094
<i>Joon, are you very busy?
Let's talk for a bit.</i>

698
00:50:00,014 --> 00:50:01,615
<i>Why? What is it?</i>

699
00:50:10,402 --> 00:50:13,199
<i>Do you happen to have any money?</i>

700
00:50:20,603 --> 00:50:22,500
Why all of a sudden?

701
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,887
Is someone sick this time or
did someone get in trouble?

702
00:50:25,887 --> 00:50:28,268
If you threw away your daughter
and got married, then live well.

703
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:31,855
Why are you always asking
for money? Am I your husband?

704
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:34,594
My life is hard too. It's hard.

705
00:50:34,594 --> 00:50:36,574
It's really hard for me too!

706
00:50:55,896 --> 00:50:58,416
<i>You worked so hard for Gangsu Group.</i>

707
00:50:58,416 --> 00:51:00,726
You devoted your entire youth to them.

708
00:51:00,726 --> 00:51:03,067
They worked you day and night.

709
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:06,065
They fired you without even a warning?

710
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:09,266
Give it a rest.

711
00:51:11,016 --> 00:51:13,585
I'm having a really hard time too.

712
00:51:13,585 --> 00:51:18,275
How could they do that? How could they?

713
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:22,061
It's so unfair for you. How could they?

714
00:51:22,061 --> 00:51:24,559
Don't you feel so wronged?

715
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,692
<i>Hey, driver.</i>

716
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:28,496
Yes.

717
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,556
Things must be so hard
for you lately, Woo Sung.

718
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,856
I heard your little brother is hiding
after the trouble he caused.

719
00:51:44,856 --> 00:51:47,336
You must be worried, right?

720
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:50,869
I'm not worried.

721
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:53,440
It'll all be resolved tomorrow morning.

722
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,224
He's not going to turn himself in
to the prosecutors, is he?

723
00:51:57,224 --> 00:51:58,340
Wow.

724
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,161
Then Gangsu Group would be yours, right?

725
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,269
Hey, watch your mouth.

726
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:11,090
Don't worry.
She's been with me for three years.

727
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:15,701
She knows better than anyone that she
can't work for me if she talks easily.

728
00:52:15,701 --> 00:52:17,684
Right, Joon?

729
00:52:17,684 --> 00:52:19,559
Yes, of course.

730
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:23,780
It's not that he's surrendering himself.

731
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,349
If it's not that, then what?

732
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:28,481
What is it?

733
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:30,335
I don't know. I'm tired.

734
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:33,565
I'm dying of curiosity. Just tell me.

735
00:52:33,565 --> 00:52:35,612
What is it? Tell me.

736
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,331
It's cold. It's cold.

737
00:52:43,414 --> 00:52:45,867
No, it's not cold.

738
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:48,152
It's not cold.

739
00:52:48,152 --> 00:52:50,713
I will wait for Joon here.

740
00:52:50,713 --> 00:52:53,041
I will wait.

741
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:57,798
I will show her that
my feelings are sincere.

742
00:52:57,798 --> 00:52:59,161
I will show her.

743
00:53:06,077 --> 00:53:09,202
No... no!

744
00:53:10,536 --> 00:53:13,702
No!

745
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:17,358
Joon!

746
00:53:18,443 --> 00:53:25,085
Joon!

747
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,246
Get up.

748
00:53:41,226 --> 00:53:44,364
No, I'm going to wait for Joon.

749
00:53:44,364 --> 00:53:46,170
Stop it and get up.

750
00:53:49,206 --> 00:53:52,273
What about Joon? Is she here?

751
00:53:52,273 --> 00:53:54,563
Please go back to the hotel.

752
00:53:54,563 --> 00:53:56,164
Please just go back.

753
00:53:56,164 --> 00:54:00,014
No, I'm going to wait here
for Joon's judgment.

754
00:54:00,014 --> 00:54:04,193
If you're going to be so stubborn,
then cut off your ties with me.

755
00:54:05,695 --> 00:54:07,885
Jae Hoon, why would you say such a thing?

756
00:54:15,715 --> 00:54:16,949
Aren't you going?

757
00:54:18,018 --> 00:54:19,139
I'll go.

758
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,599
I told you.

759
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,471
No news is good news
when it comes to me and my father.

760
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,297
Honey, Honey!

761
00:55:02,297 --> 00:55:04,427
Honey!

762
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:07,967
- Dad, Dad!
- Honey!

763
00:55:07,967 --> 00:55:11,086
Honey, Honey!

764
00:55:11,086 --> 00:55:14,273
Joon's Dad, Joon's Dad!

765
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:16,505
Dad, Dad!

766
00:55:18,923 --> 00:55:20,264
<i>Honey!</i>

767
00:55:48,938 --> 00:55:51,824
<i>[Mom] </i>

768
00:56:05,063 --> 00:56:06,340
It's me, Mom.

769
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:11,202
Have two starting today.

770
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:14,972
Shouldn't you do that, at least,
considering what you did to me?

771
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:17,362
Otherwise, I might
really call the police.

772
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,840
Let go of me.

773
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:35,471
What are you planning to do?

774
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:38,501
You're not really going
to the police, are you?

775
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:41,331
Ah, I don't know.

776
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,639
How much will you
give me if I stay quiet?

777
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:45,728
I need some money quickly.

778
00:56:45,728 --> 00:56:47,179
Are you going to be this way?

779
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:50,146
Because of that troublemaker
rich guy you work for

780
00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:53,501
I lost my hotel job and
things aren't so good for me.

781
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:55,349
How much do you want to offer?

782
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:57,809
How much do you want to offer
for me to keep my mouth shut?

783
00:56:59,802 --> 00:57:03,889
You should know there are many
other ways to do this.

784
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:08,436
Oh, you're coming on strong.

785
00:57:08,436 --> 00:57:12,286
Why? Will you hurt me if I talk?

786
00:57:12,286 --> 00:57:14,802
Hey, you're not even the victim.

787
00:57:14,802 --> 00:57:17,266
She settled and accepted it.

788
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:19,367
Do you think you have
the right to act like this?

789
00:57:19,367 --> 00:57:22,608
Social justice and
getting rid of corruption.

790
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:26,458
I'm thinking I should cut off this
corruption while I can.

791
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:28,947
I want to make this into a just country.

792
00:57:28,947 --> 00:57:30,306
What do you think?

793
00:57:32,371 --> 00:57:36,778
This is why people need
to walk a careful path.

794
00:57:36,778 --> 00:57:41,628
If employment status is unstable,
society will always act up and complain.

795
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:44,438
That's the state you're in.

796
00:57:44,438 --> 00:57:45,706
That's correct.

797
00:57:45,706 --> 00:57:49,097
That's why I really
hate rich conglomerates.

798
00:57:49,097 --> 00:57:51,338
It's really funny if you think about it.

799
00:57:51,338 --> 00:57:56,329
Your chairman's son runs away and
society ends up with more power.

800
00:57:56,329 --> 00:57:59,387
The reporters are all waiting
in front of the company today too.

801
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:05,644
Do you mean it?

802
00:58:05,644 --> 00:58:07,856
- What?
- Money.

803
00:58:07,856 --> 00:58:09,554
Do you really need it?

804
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:16,815
You're not on the same side.

805
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:18,786
What do you mean?

806
00:58:23,722 --> 00:58:26,894
He's not going to turn himself in
to the prosecutors, is he?

807
00:58:26,894 --> 00:58:28,619
It's not that he's surrendering himself.

808
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:31,706
If it's not that, then what?

809
00:58:31,706 --> 00:58:33,760
What is it?

810
00:58:36,052 --> 00:58:37,512
What do you think?

811
00:58:40,047 --> 00:58:41,588
<i>In my experience...</i>

812
00:58:41,588 --> 00:58:43,711
<i>these things are usually
from someone on the inside.</i>

813
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:46,608
Enemies are usually someone close by.

814
00:58:48,762 --> 00:58:51,108
Where is Hyuk now?

815
00:58:51,108 --> 00:58:53,748
Have you seen him before?

816
00:58:56,987 --> 00:59:01,351
He's the second son of Gangsu Group's
Byun Gang Su, Byun Hyuk.

817
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:03,568
Do you know him?

818
00:59:03,568 --> 00:59:05,137
Ah, oh...

819
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:11,634
We got a call that he caused a scene
here and got kicked out.

820
00:59:11,634 --> 00:59:16,574
How could you kick out
a VIP guest like that?

821
00:59:16,574 --> 00:59:19,342
If CEO Byun Gang Su finds out...

822
00:59:19,342 --> 00:59:23,197
that his son was chased out in that
manner, what do you think will happen?

823
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:25,650
I... I'm sorry.

824
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:30,210
Our hotel has never kicked anyone out.

825
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:32,632
- You haven't?
- No. Never.

826
00:59:32,632 --> 00:59:37,581
That kind of unfortunate event
has never happened in our hotel.

827
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:39,182
- Is that right?
- Of course.

828
00:59:46,693 --> 00:59:47,889
Hello.

829
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:54,188
You know who I am now, right?

830
00:59:54,188 --> 00:59:55,981
Yes, of course.

831
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:10,909
Hey, parking.

832
01:00:12,713 --> 01:00:14,304
The police may go looking for him.

833
01:00:14,304 --> 01:00:15,880
Hide him so he doesn't get caught.

834
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,898
We can't fix it if he shows up now.

835
01:00:21,012 --> 01:00:22,869
Can I get a card for my room?

836
01:00:35,592 --> 01:00:38,389
Oh, that's a cool uniform.

837
01:00:38,389 --> 01:00:39,853
That's a great fit.

838
01:00:51,512 --> 01:00:53,387
<i>To his room!</i>

839
01:00:53,387 --> 01:00:54,463
Here you go.

840
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:56,681
Thank you.

841
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:13,916
Oops! Oh my, oh my.

842
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:16,014
I'm so sorry. What can I do?

843
01:01:16,014 --> 01:01:18,101
- I'm sorry.
- This is nothing.

844
01:01:23,409 --> 01:01:26,518
Don't be like that. Just take it off.

845
01:01:26,518 --> 01:01:28,927
I can dry it for you.
It will only take 10 minutes.

846
01:01:28,927 --> 01:01:30,458
Exactly 10 minutes.

847
01:01:48,284 --> 01:01:50,880
I can't do that while I'm on duty.

848
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,007
Goodbye, then.

849
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:54,101
Excuse me.

850
01:01:56,099 --> 01:01:57,306
Excuse me...

851
01:02:52,724 --> 01:02:54,262
My sweet home.

852
01:02:56,592 --> 01:02:58,972
My sweet home. My sweet home.

853
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,061
Home sweet home. Home sweet home.

854
01:03:44,927 --> 01:03:46,128
This is nice.

855
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:19,083
Hey... what are you doing?

856
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:21,673
Keep the car waiting downstairs.
I'll bring him out.

857
01:04:21,673 --> 01:04:23,400
We'll talk details later.

858
01:04:28,094 --> 01:04:32,144
I can't believe things
are over with Joon.

859
01:04:40,574 --> 01:04:42,005
Are you sad?

860
01:04:43,056 --> 01:04:44,275
I'm sad too.

861
01:04:50,409 --> 01:04:51,530
Is that Jae Hoon?

862
01:04:55,382 --> 01:04:57,835
<i>[My Friend, Jae Hoon]</i>

863
01:04:59,304 --> 01:05:01,465
- Yeah, Jae Hoon.
- Hurry up and open the door.

864
01:05:29,804 --> 01:05:33,057
I'm here for your
dry cleaning. Are you inside?

865
01:05:38,224 --> 01:05:39,815
<i>Don't say a word.</i>

866
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:52,547
Joon, what's going on? Why are you here?

867
01:05:52,547 --> 01:05:54,021
Are you working here again?

868
01:05:54,021 --> 01:05:55,516
- Get inside.
- Inside?

869
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:57,746
I don't have time to explain. Get inside.

870
01:05:57,746 --> 01:05:59,177
<i>The police are outside.</i>

871
01:05:59,177 --> 01:06:02,059
I think they know you're here.

872
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:05,179
Joon, you're here to help me?

873
01:06:05,179 --> 01:06:08,733
So, you were worried 
about me, weren't you?

874
01:06:08,733 --> 01:06:11,121
No, I'm here because of money.

875
01:06:11,121 --> 01:06:13,210
- Huh?
- What?

876
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,653
<i>There's a girl?</i>

877
01:06:15,653 --> 01:06:20,846
To put it simply, Hyuk has the fortune
of the folk character, On Dal.

878
01:06:20,846 --> 01:06:22,280
That's what I'm saying.

879
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:27,949
So, Hyuk needs to be with this
girl in order to become a great man.

880
01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:31,708
She's already close to him,
a girl like Pyung Gang.

881
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:35,489
I think I'll charge five million won
to get you out. How about it?

882
01:06:39,175 --> 01:06:41,132
No? I'll leave if you don't want to.

883
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:49,775
I'm in.

884
01:06:53,088 --> 01:06:54,211
What?

885
01:06:55,434 --> 01:06:57,512
I have a condition too though.

886
01:06:57,512 --> 01:06:59,152
What's the condition?

887
01:06:59,152 --> 01:07:03,820
Until I can go home...
will you stay by my side, Joon?

888
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,769
- What?
- Hey.

889
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:08,675
I have nowhere to go because
the police are following me.

890
01:07:08,675 --> 01:07:11,467
I have to be on the run for now.

891
01:07:11,467 --> 01:07:14,494
I think I'll be less scared
with you by my side.

892
01:07:14,494 --> 01:07:16,764
What kind of crazy things
are you saying?

893
01:07:16,764 --> 01:07:19,994
I'll pay you the average salary
of a Gangsu Group secretary.

894
01:07:21,867 --> 01:07:24,943
You'll work from the time
you wake up until you go to sleep.

895
01:07:24,943 --> 01:07:26,056
What do you think?

896
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:35,896
Hey, are you insane?

897
01:07:35,896 --> 01:07:38,445
- Who are you...
- My work schedule...

898
01:07:38,445 --> 01:07:40,869
will be 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

899
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:42,715
- What?
- Okay.

900
01:07:42,715 --> 01:07:45,173
No personal conversation
and no personal chores.

901
01:07:45,173 --> 01:07:47,099
You are not allowed
to pretend we are friends.

902
01:07:48,425 --> 01:07:50,695
Isn't that kind of harsh?

903
01:07:50,695 --> 01:07:52,150
What? You don't like it?

904
01:07:55,231 --> 01:07:57,141
- I'm in.
- <i>Hey.</i>

905
01:07:57,141 --> 01:07:59,202
What are you two doing?

906
01:07:59,202 --> 01:08:01,271
Hello? Hello?

907
01:08:01,271 --> 01:08:03,882
- <i>Hello?</i>
- This is important. Can you be quiet?

908
01:08:03,882 --> 01:08:05,177
What did you say?

909
01:08:10,385 --> 01:08:14,710
Then is today our first day?

910
01:08:18,118 --> 01:08:19,743
Yes, day one.

911
01:08:20,787 --> 01:08:21,966
What? Day one?

912

<i>It was always the second son
who was the problem.</i>

919
01:09:07,932 --> 01:09:11,069
<i>I heard you were in charge of him.
Where is Byun Hyuk now?</i>

920
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:13,043
<i>What kind of person is like that?</i>

921
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:15,851
<i>He looks very elegant.</i>

922
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,292
<i>Is that Joon's boyfriend?</i>

923
01:09:17,292 --> 01:09:19,668
<i>How much do you need?
Tell me. I'll lend it to you.</i>

924
01:09:19,668 --> 01:09:20,979
<i>Forget it. Let's end it with this.</i>

925

<i>Let's go down our own paths now.</i>

926

<i>Why does everything I do
end up like this?</i>
