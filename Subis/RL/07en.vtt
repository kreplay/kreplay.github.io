<i>[Revolutionary Love]</i>

3
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:22,524
Our Gangsu Group...

4
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:25,591
<i>[Episode 7]</i>
cherishes our cleaning employees.

5
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:27,954
We are considerate of them.

6
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:35,972
Therefore, CEO Byun Gang Su...

7
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:40,856
has decided to not use external
contractors for cleaning services.

8
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:42,429
He will hire them directly.

9
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:46,576
He decided to make that
announcement on this very day.

10
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:49,409
What? Is that true?

11
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:51,417
Hyuk didn't mention that.

12
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:52,912
I never heard that.

13
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,683
Hyuk.

14
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:58,380
- What's going on?
- Hey.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,445
What's happening?

16
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,087
Is it true?

17
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:05,200
Is that true?

18
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:08,603
Changing temporary
employees to full-time?

19
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:10,822
All of those employees?

20
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:15,274
CEO Byun Gang Su.

21
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:20,560
I truly thank you for this
very meaningful decision.

22
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,989
- It's true?
- Really? Oh my.

23
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:27,405
CEO Byun Gang Su!
Thank you!

24
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:29,634
Thank you!

25
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:31,730
Give him a round of applause!

26
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:40,243
That little punk.

27
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:45,490
CEO Byun! CEO!

28
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,406
Is that true?

29
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:49,983
Please give us a comment.

30
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,007
Just one comment.

31
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,984
Hyuk, you little rascal.

32
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:07,456
Come here.

33
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:12,143
Hey, you insane little punk.

34
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:16,456
When did I ever decide that?

35
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:20,568
Who said you could say that?

36
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:24,359
They clean the Gangsu Group building.

37
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:27,195
It's strange that they're not
employees of Gangsu Group.

38
00:02:27,195 --> 00:02:29,343
So, what?

39
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:32,127
You dare to protest your
father's company?

40
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:34,126
I wasn't there as your son.

41
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:36,139
I was there as the cleaner,
Byun Hyuk.

42
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,937
So...

43
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:40,588
you're going to become
a fighter for rights overnight?

44
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:41,902
It's not that.

45
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:43,247
I know what's going on.

46
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,576
The main contractor abuses
its power over contractors.

47
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:47,737
Service contractors
abuse power over the employees.

48
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:51,396
It's never-ending.
That's how it is.

49
00:02:51,396 --> 00:02:53,318
I know it all too.

50
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:59,950
You don't know what you're talking about.

51
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,068
What were you doing?
What were you doing!

52
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:13,111
- Father!
- You should've stopped it!

53
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:14,818
Stop it, Father!

54
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:17,277
Oh, you'd better let go.
Let go of me!

55
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:18,657
Don't hit Jae Hoon, please.

56
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,328
- Just hit me.
- Hey!

57
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:22,548
- Don't hit other people.
- Let go!

58
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:25,137
I said don't hit others!

59
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:48,210
How dare you?

60
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:00,281
Why, you little...

61
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:05,074
All right, let's both die here today.

62
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:06,403
You rascal.

63
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:08,663
Get up now, punk.

64
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:11,153
I... I have something to say.

65
00:04:11,153 --> 00:04:12,868
Joon.

66
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,500
Who are you?

67
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:23,995
Hey, Secretary Park.
What were you doing!

68
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:25,019
Please leave.

69
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,774
Just a moment.
I just need one moment.

70
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,209
Didn't Gangsu Group contract out the
cleaners in order to save labor costs?

71
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,850
But, when the contractors hire cleaners,
you pay a high commission fee.

72
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,954
Meanwhile, the cleaners get poor
benefits, pay, and unfair dismissal.

73
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:48,266
So? What does that
have to do with me?

74
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,199
What I'm trying say is...

75
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,221
if Gangsu Group hired cleaners directly,
there would be no difference in cost.

76
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:57,940
Also, the cleaning staff
wouldn't suffer under contractors.

77
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,538
If the costs are the same,
why would I have to do such a thing?

78
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:05,922
"A person's heart is more
important than money."

79
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:08,120
"To create employees who care"

80
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,319
"owners must first
understand their hearts."

81
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,718
Third line on page 470 of your
book, "Human Management."

82
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:17,682
Didn't you write that yourself, CEO Byun?

83
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:21,911
You read my book?

84
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:24,552
Between employees
who think of it as their company

85
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:27,331
and those who consider it temporary...

86
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:30,283
who do you think would work harder?

87
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:39,067
Are you a cleaner, as well?

88
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:42,093
No, I got fired yesterday.

89
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:45,317
Then I have no reason to listen to you.

90
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:50,548
You should work here, at the least,
to request something from me.

91
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,617
You're nothing here.

92
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:58,105
You can talk all you want and show off,
but what's the use?

93
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:04,115
If you're so great,
you should become an employee here.

94
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:08,680
Full-time employment is silly.

95
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,846
What?

96
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:15,567
You work so hard to get it,
but you lose your job in your 40s.

97
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:21,004
People waste time, money,
and their lives just to get that job.

98
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:41,384
You're a coward.

99
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,471
A coward?

100
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:47,593
- Are you talking about me?
- Yes.

101
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:50,473
You're scared and running
before even starting.

102
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:55,557
You have lots of excuses,
and you haven't even tried.

103
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:58,446
Coward.

104
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:15,999
Joon, I'm so sorry.

105
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,696
I'll apologize on behalf of my father.

106
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:19,391
Joon.

107
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:49,348
Was this it?

108
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:51,915
Your plan to do whatever you could?

109
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:56,244
At least, I didn't die.

110
00:07:57,108 --> 00:08:01,360
Since things worked out like this,
I'll keep trying.

111
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,031
I mean it.

112
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,728
No, this is more than enough.

113
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:16,062
Don't get yourself hit over
something that won't work out.

114
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,519
I'll get going.

115
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:38,214
- This is Strategic Planning.
- This is Strategic Planning.

116
00:08:38,214 --> 00:08:39,322
There will be an announcement.

117
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:41,501
Please wait for
the official announcement.

118
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:43,424
Our department doesn't handle that.

119
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:46,316
Yes, I'm sorry.

120
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:51,644
I'm sorry I couldn't put a stop to it.

121
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:54,774
Wasn't it your job before to
keep an eye on that second son?

122
00:08:54,774 --> 00:08:59,332
That guy came and
caused a scene at your event.

123
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,654
Does it make sense
that you didn't know about it?

124
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,104
Hey, do you know how much money
we spent on this project?

125
00:09:07,104 --> 00:09:11,803
Yet, no one is interested
in the new food item.

126
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:13,714
Everyone is asking about
the cleaners instead.

127
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:18,142
What are you going to do?
What are you going to about it!

128
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,421
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:21,868
Is "sorry" going to cut it?

130
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:23,047
Oh.

131
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:25,657
Yes.

132
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:30,124
We are not responsible for the cleaners.

133
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:34,037
Nothing's been confirmed, so please
wait for an official announcement.

134
00:09:34,037 --> 00:09:35,413
Yes.

135
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:39,951
Move!

136
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:48,028
Are you all crazy?

137
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:51,163
What were you thinking going up there?

138
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:54,510
You trusted in the CEO's son
and caused that scene?

139
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,758
I could lose my job
because of you people!

140
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:01,649
Hey, stop thinking so negatively.

141
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:03,078
He is the CEO's son.

142
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:04,158
You never know.

143
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:06,472
CEO Byun might do everything
that his son asked for.

144
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,703
- That is true.
- He might.

145
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,941
Oh, what's wrong?

146
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:17,951
Did someone hit you?

147
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:23,019
Do what his son asked for?
Yeah, right.

148
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:25,866
It's all over. It's over.

149
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:30,495
So annoying.

150
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:32,020
To his own son!

151
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:51,804
Even if he's angry,
how could he do this to his son?

152
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:54,806
I guess it was a part of the process.

153
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:56,596
I tried doing what I could.

154
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:59,056
I'm sorry things worked out this way.

155
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:03,121
Why would you be sorry? We're fine.

156
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:09,773
Telling all those people that
we are important was more than enough.

157
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:12,942
Yeah, you were cool.

158
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,481
Thank you.

159
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:16,761
Where did Joon go, anyway?

160
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,923
She followed you to the CEO's office.

161
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:20,731
Didn't you see her?

162
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:26,296
Eat this.

163
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,735
- You eat one too, Honey.
- Okay.

164
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:31,256
Here you go.

165
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:34,503
Yum. It's sweet.

166
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:39,193
Oh, it's winter already.

167
00:11:39,193 --> 00:11:40,966
Every day, it's colder.

168
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,309
- Good, right?
- Yes.

169
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,716
Is it good?

170
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:46,503
Here.

171
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,149
I'm here, Dad.

172
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:19,783
Sorry it's been so long.

173
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:23,668
<i>You're a coward.</i>

174
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,828
You're scared and running
before even starting.

175
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,164
You have lots of excuses,
and you haven't even tried.

176
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:40,241
Coward.

177
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:43,493
Am I really?

178
00:12:46,922 --> 00:12:52,254
Am I really... a coward?

179
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,740
Jae Hoon.

180
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:47,269
Joon's not home yet.

181
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,621
Why are you like that?

182
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:53,971
You only think about yourself, don't you?

183
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:58,322
You don't care if others get hurt
or have a hard time because of you.

184
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:00,912
Only your life matters to you.

185
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:03,182
I'm really sorry, Jae Hoon.

186
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:07,173
I didn't mean to ruin the event.

187
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:13,660
It was really important
to the cleaning employees.

188
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,567
Cleaning employees?

189
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:18,339
Since when did you care
about people like that?

190
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:19,403
Jae Hoon.

191
00:14:19,403 --> 00:14:21,916
If you're going to cause problems...

192
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,870
do it outside the company.

193
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,765
Don't cause a headache
for so many people.

194
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:31,870
I'm getting really tired of you.

195
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:41,714
<i>About Hyuk...</i>

196
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,966
What do you think of him?

197
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:47,363
I don't know much,
but he sure has a lot of spirit.

198
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:48,797
Yeah?

199
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,100
You think so too, right?

200
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,020
That kid...

201
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,248
I wondered what he would be able to do.

202
00:14:57,248 --> 00:15:01,938
He has a more ambitious spirit
than I thought.

203
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:07,869
While we're on the topic...

204
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:12,453
why don't you take him into your
Strategic Planning team?

205
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:15,466
See if he can make it or not.

206
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:19,539
Take him in and put him to work.

207
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:24,764
I can't do that, CEO Byun.

208
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:26,464
You can't?

209
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,032
Why not?

210
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:33,317
If you want him on my team,
do it officially.

211
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:38,078
As it turns out,
we're hiring new interns.

212
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:43,128
Getting hired fairly
by his own merits into Gangsu

213
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:46,408
is what's best for you and Hyuk.

214
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:48,423
Oh, no.

215
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:51,782
He couldn't even graduate
college in the US.

216
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:55,551
He's only a high school graduate
and has no experience.

217
00:15:55,551 --> 00:16:00,365
How can he get hired by our company?

218
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:04,902
We won't be looking at academics,
gender, or age this time.

219
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:07,865
We won't be looking at the
resume they've built up.

220
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:12,871
We'll be choosing based on
their capabilities and character.

221
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,864
So...

222
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:17,833
you're saying Hyuk can get in?

223
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,971
You're curious to know
if he can make it or not.

224
00:16:20,971 --> 00:16:25,293
If he can make it,
he should get in.

225
00:16:47,264 --> 00:16:51,217
<i>The intern applications start today.
Don't be stubborn.</i>

226
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:06,152
Is it true that you won't be
looking at the resume?

227
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:10,292
- Yes.
- Oh, Gangsu Group's doing good work.

228
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,301
Go on.

229
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:16,914
What? You want me to what?

230
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:20,654
Apply for the open call for interns.

231
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:25,661
If you pass everything
and become an intern

232
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:29,162
I'll think about hiring
the cleaning staff directly.

233
00:17:29,162 --> 00:17:33,356
Apply today if you want to be
held responsible for your words.

234
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:36,801
Father, this isn't right.

235
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,973
- Why not?
- An intern?

236
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:46,137
How could I get in?
You know my education and resume.

237
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:47,691
This isn't a proper negotiation.

238
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,781
You're basically saying you won't do it.

239
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:53,432
A person who makes claims
without even knowing a thing.

240
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:55,942
Is that a proper negotiation?

241
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,343
- Father.
- I'm done talking.

242
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:02,568
It's up to you if you
want to accept it or not.

243
00:18:19,117 --> 00:18:20,653
Hello?

244
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:25,419
Wh... what? Intern?

245
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:29,193
Who? You?

246
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:31,055
Yes, me.

247
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:32,786
Does this make sense?

248
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:34,893
He wants me to apply to be an intern.

249
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:39,334
He says I need to pass so he'll
consider hiring the cleaners.

250
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,273
What do you think this means?

251
00:18:41,273 --> 00:18:45,019
What else? He's saying screw off.

252
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:49,349
Well, there's no need
to say it so directly.

253
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:50,721
Your education is lacking.

254
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:55,076
All you have going for you
is that you're the CEO's son.

255
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:57,535
It's not like the CEO
is giving you the position.

256
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:00,579
He wants you to fight fairly
with others and pass on your own.

257
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:02,259
Yes.

258
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:04,574
He must be telling me to screw off.

259
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:06,689
I heard they're not looking at
the resume this time.

260
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:09,307
Even so, there's a limit to it.

261
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:12,938
At the final stages, what would
they look at if not the resume?

262
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:14,127
Hold on.

263
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:20,723
So, this whole thing about "no resumes"
was all about the company's image?

264
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:23,026
Yet, you were pushing me to apply?

265
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:24,683
Even though you knew it was all a lie.

266
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:27,035
Joon, you're going to
apply to be an intern too?

267
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:29,035
Don't be ridiculous.

268
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,403
You and Hyuk are on a different level.

269
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:36,394
Yes, Joon is on a different level
of intelligence than me.

270
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:37,644
I'm glad that you know.

271
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:39,664
There's no need for you
to be conflicted.

272
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:41,844
You will fail that intern interview.

273
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:44,384
Gangsu Group will re-sign
with the cleaning contractors.

274
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:49,517
Then CEO Min will continue
to reap the benefits.

275
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:52,384
Well, then there's
nothing to think about.

276
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:53,925
Just apply.

277
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,959
Yes, right?

278
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,294
What?

279
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:58,753
- Do what?
- Hey, Baek Joon.

280
00:19:58,753 --> 00:20:00,929
You said you'd get them hired.

281
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:03,196
Their lives are in your hands right now.

282
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:04,867
You're quitting without even trying?

283
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:06,730
No, that's not it.

284
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,959
Don't egg him on to do things
he can't be responsible for.

285
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:13,398
Then you shouldn't have done that
performance at the event at all, Hyuk.

286
00:20:13,398 --> 00:20:14,874
That is true.

287
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:17,943
No. Don't even think about it.
You can't do it.

288
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:19,469
Yes, I can't.

289
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,155
A man is giving up before trying?

290
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,540
Yes, that's not right.

291
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,538
I told you not to do it.

292
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:29,142
I told you to do it.

293
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:44,567
Your father told Hyuk
to apply for an internship?

294
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:46,064
I know, right?

295
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:49,263
Even if he is angry,
why would he tell Hyuk to intern?

296
00:20:49,263 --> 00:20:50,957
It's a bit too much.

297
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:53,971
What in the world is he thinking?

298
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:58,772
Is there anything you know, Mother?

299
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:00,334
<i>You told me to give him wings.</i>

300
00:21:00,334 --> 00:21:02,680
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

301
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,824
If he has wings, he'll fly.

302
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:08,003
I don't know if he's a phoenix.

303
00:21:08,003 --> 00:21:13,479
I need to throw him to know
if he's an eagle or a baby chick.

304
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:17,343
Father said that?

305
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:22,186
I wondered what that meant, at the time.

306
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:24,493
Hey, Woo Sung.

307
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:29,131
Do you think your father is trying
to help train Hyuk right now?

308
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:33,888
Shouldn't you help Hyuk
as his older brother, then?

309
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:35,776
Come on, Mother.

310
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:38,224
You know he's just a troublemaker.

311
00:21:38,224 --> 00:21:40,044
How could I help?

312
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:43,897
Hey, Hyuk didn't turn
his back on you back then.

313
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:47,176
That young thing was
protecting his older brother...

314
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:54,240
Never mind. Let's not talk about it.

315
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:03,486
Oh, I can't do it. I can't.

316
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:07,203
How can I do it?
Even if they're not looking at resumes.

317
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:09,555
I need to know something
to pass the tests.

318
00:22:09,555 --> 00:22:12,105
Oh, I can't do it. I can't do it.

319
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:31,862
Is Hyuk that poorly educated?

320
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:34,662
I don't really know.

321
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:37,608
How much of a bad student was he?

322
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,421
It can't be just that.

323
00:22:39,421 --> 00:22:42,429
Yeah, it can't just be about that.

324
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,654
What would happen if he doesn't pass?

325
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:48,222
That determines whether
we become direct hires or not.

326
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:51,894
It must be such
an emotional burden, right?

327
00:22:51,894 --> 00:22:53,692
Yeah, yeah.

328
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,634
What brings you by?

329
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:26,413
I was just curious about where you lived.

330
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:29,715
It's not as bad as I thought it'd be.

331
00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:31,355
My home is very shabby.

332
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:33,275
Would you like to go to a cafe nearby?

333
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:34,964
It's okay, Jae Hoon.

334
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:37,105
Don't worry about that.

335
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:40,365
There's a cafe five minutes away.

336
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:43,217
He says he was curious
about where I lived.

337
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:46,286
Then I should show him.

338
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:51,230
Come on, Brother.

339
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,586
Wait here.

340
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:38,086
Are you okay with coffee, Woo Sung?

341
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:41,861
No, I don't drink coffee after 6:00 p.m.

342
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:44,844
Then I'll drink alone.

343
00:24:47,656 --> 00:24:50,835
Ah, okay. I'm recharged.

344
00:24:50,835 --> 00:24:53,259
It’s a bit small, right?

345
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:56,369
Sit wherever you feel comfortable.

346
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:04,527
So, Father told you
to apply for the internship.

347
00:25:04,527 --> 00:25:05,844
That's what I heard.

348
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:07,396
Yes.

349
00:25:15,384 --> 00:25:16,842
What is it?

350
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,432
You said you needed money.

351
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:22,965
I gave you more than enough in there.

352
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:25,207
Take it and leave Korea for a while.

353
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:29,548
Go on vacation
and give your mind a break.

354
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:35,102
Also, don't take Father's offer
too seriously.

355
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:38,595
Don't act up, kid.

356
00:25:39,978 --> 00:25:42,968
You wouldn't even
pass the intern interview.

357
00:25:42,968 --> 00:25:46,406
What are you rambling on about
direct hiring of cleaners?

358
00:25:47,137 --> 00:25:51,696
Just shut your mouth and live quietly.

359
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:55,545
That's what he means by it.

360
00:26:04,332 --> 00:26:05,893
Hyuk.

361
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:10,166
You've done enough.

362
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,273
You've shown your presence enough.

363
00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:19,351
Stop now and go have fun
somewhere outside of this country.

364
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:23,721
I'll give you whatever you need
while you're there, okay?

365
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,960
<i>Please, Hyuk.</i>

366
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:35,154
I'll do whatever you need.

367
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,771
Save me just this once.

368
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:41,277
You know I'll die if our father knows.

369
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:43,963
You're the only person who can help me.

370
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:46,500
You're the only one...

371
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:51,978
I'll do anything you want, okay?

372
00:26:54,471 --> 00:26:58,594
So, Hyuk. Save me this once.

373
00:26:59,228 --> 00:27:01,074
I'm begging like this.

374
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:09,042
My goodness. I can't believe this.

375
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,912
You little bastard.

376
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:12,596
Honey!

377
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:14,955
Have you no fear?

378
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:19,308
You took the car out tonight
and hit a person?

379
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:22,690
What? What happened?

380
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:27,501
Hyuk... Hyuk.

381
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:30,270
I'm sorry.

382
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,076
Turn yourself in!

383
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:36,257
Take responsibility
for the things you've done!

384
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:41,310
Honey, please. Our Hyuk is still young.

385
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,340
He still has his future.
Please help him this once.

386
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,557
I don't know.

387
00:27:49,096 --> 00:27:51,143
Honey!

388
00:27:51,143 --> 00:27:54,342
Honey, Honey!

389
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:56,126
Honey!

390
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:14,969
This is amusing.

391
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:19,838
When you say you'll do anything for me...

392
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:24,931
it means you're desperate.

393
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:27,113
Right?

394
00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:34,779
Now that I think about it...

395
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,977
there was only one thing
you could do for me.

396
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:42,597
Ah, I'm not upset by it though.

397
00:28:45,592 --> 00:28:48,002
For one thing, it's not fun anymore.

398
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:54,189
Whatever it is...
people doing things for me.

399
00:28:57,037 --> 00:29:01,755
You're not saying you're really going
to apply for this internship, are you?

400
00:29:06,082 --> 00:29:09,340
Honestly, I wasn't up for the task.

401
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,303
But you showed up here
worrying about me.

402
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:17,805
I feel pathetic at the fact
that I was scared.

403
00:29:18,413 --> 00:29:20,405
So, you're doing it?

404
00:29:20,952 --> 00:29:23,625
You'll cheer me on, right, Brother?

405
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:58,000
Tell him he doesn't need
to feel too burdened by us.

406
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,598
Everyone has to make his own living.

407
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,020
People have to live their own lives.

408
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,816
Of course, he doesn't need
to feel responsible for us at all.

409
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:07,243
That's right.

410
00:30:19,836 --> 00:30:21,888
Are you just leaving like that?

411
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,049
What is he thinking?

412
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:26,585
Do you know anything?

413
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:29,311
Thinking? Nothing, really.

414
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:32,519
I just got mad on my own
and got upset.

415
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:35,979
Is that really it?

416
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:37,336
Hm?

417
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,832
I'm sure that's all it is.

418
00:30:38,832 --> 00:30:43,539
He probably only said it out of
embarrassment in front of his brother.

419
00:30:44,284 --> 00:30:47,451
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
- No.

420
00:30:47,451 --> 00:30:49,376
Don't do a single thing.

421
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:53,192
Let him go for the internship.

422
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:58,021
He needs to see how low and
how much of a nobody he is.

423
00:30:58,021 --> 00:30:59,946
He needs to get out there to see.

424
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:17,760
Joon, what did you just say?

425
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,046
Let's do it together, that intern test.

426
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:22,386
Really? You too?

427
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,497
Why, suddenly?

428
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:28,714
I can't leave you
to get screwed by yourself.

429
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:29,778
Joon.

430
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:32,171
Of course, it's not free,
so don't expect too much.

431
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:34,378
Intern tests all have three rounds.

432
00:31:34,378 --> 00:31:36,821
First round, human resources
screening test.

433
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:38,579
Second round, a practical skills test.

434
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:40,141
Third round, a personal interview.

435
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:42,670
For every round you pass,
200,000 won and you get special training.

436
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,039
If you pass the whole thing,
I get a bonus of 100,000 on top.

437
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,556
How about it?

438
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:51,250
That doesn't matter to me.

439
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:54,806
Special training though? What's that?

440
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:57,387
They won't accept just anyone,
even if they don't look at resumes.

441
00:31:57,387 --> 00:32:00,855
That means they need
other means to evaluate you.

442
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:02,304
Language.

443
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,890
Math.

444
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,037
Deduction.

445
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:09,964
Spatial perception, current events.

446
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,143
You need master all of these things.

447
00:32:13,143 --> 00:32:14,397
All of this?

448
00:32:14,397 --> 00:32:16,105
Yes.

449
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:20,715
Last of all... this one too.

450
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:24,885
<i>[Human Management]</i>

451
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:37,269
<i>[Interning is my path to survival!]</i>

452
00:32:43,814 --> 00:32:45,696
You think that will work?

453
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:54,163
You agree, right?

454
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,515
<i>Hey, Byun Hyuk.</i>

455
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,906
You're not studying, are you?

456
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:07,623
Get back to studying now!

457
00:33:07,623 --> 00:33:10,311
Oh, oh. Okay, I will.

458
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:13,230
I'll study. I will.

459
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,498
Joon knows me so well.

460
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,992
Eat while you study.

461
00:33:57,595 --> 00:33:59,451
Yum, this rice.

462
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:01,535
It's so good.

463
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,837
The ramen noodles are really great.

464
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:23,378
These are the questions they've used
in the past three years.

465
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:25,755
It's a study guide of past exams.

466
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:28,398
It was very hard to get this.

467
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:29,565
Use this to study.

468
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:31,394
We'll make good use of it, Madam Ahn.

469
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:32,797
Here.

470
00:34:32,797 --> 00:34:36,447
It's a study guide that Madam Ahn
worked hard to get, so memorize it.

471
00:34:37,306 --> 00:34:40,740
There's so much I have to memorize, Joon.

472
00:34:45,068 --> 00:34:47,550
Ah... yum.

473
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:50,958
- Keep it up.
- Okay.

474
00:35:23,385 --> 00:35:28,262
I managed to get
these documents from the company.

475
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:35,793
Thank you, Mister.

476
00:35:35,793 --> 00:35:37,659
No need to thank me.

477
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:42,876
Oh, you're resting.

478
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:39,596
Is it going well?

479
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:43,077
I don't know.

480
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:47,782
I'm just doing what Joon tells me to.

481
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:50,385
It's so hard, my friend.

482
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:58,416
I've been pooping blood.

483
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:03,719
<i>Why are you pushing so hard?</i>

484
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:06,697
No matter how much you rile him up,
Hyuk won't make it.

485
00:37:06,697 --> 00:37:07,871
He won't pass.

486
00:37:07,871 --> 00:37:11,780
Even if he passes rounds one and two,
he won't make it past round three.

487
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,291
Why?

488
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:18,880
Chief Byun Woo Sung will fail him.

489
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,510
Why does he go that far
to keep Hyuk in check?

490
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:27,443
He's not keeping him in check.
He looks down on him.

491
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:29,492
A younger brother is giving it a try.

492
00:37:29,492 --> 00:37:31,673
The older brother
purposely gets in the way.

493
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:33,454
Is that merely looking down on him?

494
00:37:33,454 --> 00:37:34,835
I think differently.

495
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,358
Are you getting involved in
Hyuk's sibling fights too?

496
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:42,193
You could even end up being in charge
of taking care of Hyuk instead of me.

497
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,273
What? Can't I do that?

498
00:37:44,273 --> 00:37:47,384
You do it, so why can't I do it?

499
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:50,074
Are you serious about that nonsense?

500
00:37:50,074 --> 00:37:52,835
You said you've been friends
with Hyuk since kindergarten.

501
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:55,235
Don't you know Hyuk at all?

502
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:58,099
Then what about you?
What do you know about him?

503
00:37:58,099 --> 00:37:59,739
You haven't known him that long.

504
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:03,940
At least, I know the burden of
responsibility he's carrying.

505
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,311
Do you think Hyuk knows what
the word "responsibility" means?

506
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:10,380
If he didn't know,
why would he be doing this?

507
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,862
He could live life in comfort.

508
00:38:11,862 --> 00:38:14,644
Do you really not know?
It's all because of you.

509
00:38:14,644 --> 00:38:18,065
Because you keep telling him to do it
and encouraging him.

510
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:22,889
He doesn't even know what he's doing
and he's running in head first.

511
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:28,869
What if it is because of me?
Is that wrong?

512
00:38:31,606 --> 00:38:34,894
What do you mean by that?

513
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:38,527
Whatever the reason,
he's doing something with sincerity.

514
00:38:38,527 --> 00:38:40,527
Isn't that good enough?

515
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,557
<i>What is it?</i>

516
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:46,916
That burden of responsibility?

517
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:56,795
Hey, Byun Hyuk. Are you sleeping?

518
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,472
<i>[Mister Lee]</i>

519
00:39:32,472 --> 00:39:33,490
<i>[Mister Kim]</i>

520
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:37,817
<i>[Madam Ahn]</i>

521
00:39:41,018 --> 00:39:43,277
<i>Hey, Mister Byun. Stay strong.</i>

522
00:39:43,277 --> 00:39:46,083
<i>We are staying strong, thanks to you.</i>

523
00:39:47,306 --> 00:39:49,519
<i>Hyuk, it's okay if you fail.
Don't feel burdened.</i>

524
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,302
<i>Whatever happens, thank you.</i>

525
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:53,826
<i>Thank you.</i>

526
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:58,384
<i>I'll treat you to pork belly if you
pass the intern interview.</i>

527
00:39:58,384 --> 00:40:01,523
<i>I'll treat you to pork belly
even if you fail.</i>

528
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:04,112
<i>Keep it up today too!</i>

529
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:05,913
<i>Mister Byun, stay strong!</i>

530
00:40:05,913 --> 00:40:09,472
<i>Byun Hyuk! We love you!</i>

531
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,757
Hello.

532
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:33,387
Thank you.

533
00:41:33,947 --> 00:41:38,757
Joon, you know the new guy
who moved in next door?

534
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:40,708
Is it a guy that moved in?

535
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,097
Yes.

536
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:46,577
From what I can tell,
he's around our age.

537
00:41:46,577 --> 00:41:50,788
Anyway, he looks kind of simple.

538
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:53,288
But I think he's interested in me.

539
00:41:53,288 --> 00:41:56,413
Whenever I run into him,
he never says a single word.

540
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:59,702
Then he carries my luggage
up the stairs for me.

541
00:41:59,702 --> 00:42:03,463
Well, you do have
great visuals, Yeon Hee.

542
00:42:03,463 --> 00:42:04,579
I know.

543
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:08,009
I'm so pretty that it's an annoyance.

544
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:09,833
Okay, it's ready. Let's eat.

545
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,592
Let's give it a try.

546
00:42:15,371 --> 00:42:17,523
It's so good.

547
00:42:17,523 --> 00:42:22,722
As always, the rice you mix
is the best, Joon.

548
00:42:22,722 --> 00:42:24,637
It's the red chili paste that's good.

549
00:42:24,637 --> 00:42:29,501
Gangsu Foods does make really
great red chili paste, right?

550
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:31,027
I suppose so.

551
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,298
Joon.

552
00:42:42,123 --> 00:42:44,253
Try this red chili paste.

553
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:45,809
Your dad developed this.

554
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:47,681
- Really?
- Yes.

555
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:53,478
Oh, it's spicy.

556
00:42:53,478 --> 00:42:55,159
So spicy!

557
00:42:56,648 --> 00:42:59,155
Joon, don't forget this taste.

558
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:01,896
This will become the
base of Gangsu Foods.

559
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:03,963
So spicy, so spicy.

560
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,969
By the way...

561
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:16,364
how are the preparations
for the intern test going

562
00:43:16,364 --> 00:43:17,675
with the third generation punk?

563
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:19,547
Not bad.

564
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:22,123
When is it?

565
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:25,010
Tomorrow.

566
00:43:27,067 --> 00:43:29,574
- You can do it!
- We can!

567
00:43:33,615 --> 00:43:35,048
We're not late, are we?

568
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:36,998
- We still have five minutes.
- Okay.

569
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,150
<i>[Gangsu Food Intern Screening Test]</i>

570
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:48,427
Mister Lee, Mister Kim, Madam Ahn!

571
00:43:48,427 --> 00:43:49,760
Good luck!

572
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,057
Good luck in there!

573
00:43:53,057 --> 00:43:55,407
Good luck!

574
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,293
Pass, pass, pass!

575
00:44:02,271 --> 00:44:04,193
Yes, Madam.

576
00:44:04,193 --> 00:44:07,862
Young Master Hyuk has
safely arrived at the company.

577
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:10,112
Really?

578
00:44:10,112 --> 00:44:12,603
He wasn't late, was he?

579
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:16,177
All right.

580
00:44:59,273 --> 00:45:01,755
You don't need to be scared or nervous.

581
00:45:01,755 --> 00:45:04,317
Practice like a battle
and battle like practice.

582
00:45:04,317 --> 00:45:06,788
Don't worry. I'll be there with you.

583
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:07,992
Got it?

584
00:45:09,195 --> 00:45:12,686
<i>Yes, Joon is with me.</i>

585
00:45:12,686 --> 00:45:15,451
<i>I have the study guide from Madam Ahn.</i>

586
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:17,400
Good luck!

587
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,813
<i>I have the information from Mister Lee.</i>

588
00:45:25,731 --> 00:45:28,271
<i>I'm not alone in this test.</i>

589
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,364
<i>I'm starting to see the questions.</i>

590
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:44,304
<i>Huh? I can see the answers too.</i>

591
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:46,155
<i>Wow. Awesome.</i>

592
00:45:46,155 --> 00:45:48,414
<i>Oh, oh. This one!</i>

593
00:45:48,414 --> 00:45:50,318
<i>I know this one.</i>

594
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:03,505
Chief, Chief!

595
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:06,512
What is it?

596
00:46:06,512 --> 00:46:08,965
There's a disaster.

597
00:46:08,965 --> 00:46:14,907
They say that Byun Hyuk
has passed the first round test.

598
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:28,945
Wow, this is great.

599
00:46:28,945 --> 00:46:31,960
No need to be so happy.
It's only the first round.

600
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,898
The first round is not so easy.

601
00:46:35,485 --> 00:46:39,065
Wait, what happens after first round?

602
00:46:39,065 --> 00:46:42,322
What else?
He takes the second round test.

603
00:46:42,322 --> 00:46:44,568
What is the second round test?

604
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:47,771
The second round test is a blind test.

605
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:52,199
You need to find the Gangsu Food product
from the products in front of you.

606
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:56,409
Carefully taste the food in front of you
and write your answer on the sheet.

607
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:59,735
Okay, let's get started then.

608
00:47:35,864 --> 00:47:37,514
Eat while you study.

609
00:47:52,356 --> 00:47:55,626
Yum, Gangsu.

610
00:48:01,563 --> 00:48:02,867
<i>Yum, hot bar.</i>

611
00:48:02,867 --> 00:48:04,673
<i>Don't forget it.</i>

612
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,434
<i>I'm going to test you on it.</i>

613
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:15,286
<i>In the 18th century,
he started the realist movement.</i>

614
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:17,708
<i>A realist and reformist?</i>

615
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:19,460
Ha Nam Hee.

616
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,514
A realist and reformist?

617
00:48:22,514 --> 00:48:24,362
Post Joseon era, it's Oh Seon Jong.

618
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:25,688
Yes.

619
00:49:05,173 --> 00:49:07,394
Yum.

620
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,492
Yes, yes.

621
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,902
This is the taste.

622
00:49:21,822 --> 00:49:23,836
Yeah!

623
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,605
No, Joon.

624
00:49:27,605 --> 00:49:29,548
Just one second, no five seconds.

625
00:49:29,548 --> 00:49:30,833
People are watching.

626
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,677
Three, four, five.

627
00:49:33,677 --> 00:49:34,759
I did well, right?

628
00:49:34,759 --> 00:49:36,230
You did. That was great.

629
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,032
I really didn't think
a hot bar would be there.

630
00:49:39,032 --> 00:49:40,804
The cup ramen confused me a little.

631
00:49:40,804 --> 00:49:44,615
- D, D, D, D!
- D, D, D, D!

632
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:47,425
Let's go to round three now.

633
00:49:47,425 --> 00:49:49,199
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

634
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:51,088
Good job.

635
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:54,898
What? My Hyuk passed round two?

636
00:49:54,898 --> 00:49:58,076
Really? He even passed round two?

637
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:03,219
May I ask you one more question?

638
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:07,398
Did a girl named Baek Joon pass too?

639
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:11,528
Ah, I see.

640
00:50:12,445 --> 00:50:16,027
All right. Thank you, Secretary Park.

641
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:19,840
Baek Joon? Who's that?

642
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,710
You don't need to know.

643
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:25,253
What's going on?

644
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:28,768
Is she really Pyunggang?

645
00:50:30,224 --> 00:50:32,402
Really? Yes.

646
00:50:32,402 --> 00:50:36,001
So, Hyuk even passed round two?

647
00:50:36,001 --> 00:50:39,572
So, you had a good idea,
Managing Director Seol.

648
00:50:44,233 --> 00:50:46,063
Well, then...

649
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:50,001
Who's going into the final interview?

650
00:51:24,132 --> 00:51:26,945
Tell us your positive traits.

651
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:30,726
My positive traits?

652
00:51:30,726 --> 00:51:33,240
An abundance of sensitivity.

653
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:36,777
I happen to like poems a lot.

654
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:39,777
I have over 100 poems memorized.

655
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:42,443
Should I recite one?

656
00:51:44,092 --> 00:51:46,324
"When looking at me
disgusts you and you leave"--

657
00:51:46,324 --> 00:51:47,909
That's fine.

658
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,206
Next question.

659
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:53,887
I could give you
10 billion won right now.

660
00:51:53,887 --> 00:51:55,518
Oh, really?

661
00:51:55,518 --> 00:51:57,909
You can split that with your friend.

662
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:00,840
It's up to you how you split it.

663
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,510
However...

664
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:08,340
you need your friend's agreement in order
to receive that 10 billion won from me.

665
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,516
How will you split it?

666
00:52:17,172 --> 00:52:19,876
I will split it 50:50.

667
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:23,981
Are you saying you're not
confident in negotiating?

668
00:52:23,981 --> 00:52:27,570
Think of a way you could negotiate
to maximize your profits.

669
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,903
Then answer again.

670
00:52:29,903 --> 00:52:32,811
How would that make me happy?

671
00:52:35,016 --> 00:52:36,963
You said the person was a friend.

672
00:52:36,963 --> 00:52:41,061
If I negotiated at my best
and split it 70:30 or 90:10

673
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:43,507
my friendship with that person would end.

674
00:52:43,507 --> 00:52:46,360
Then I wouldn't be happy.

675
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:52,541
I would choose to split it evenly
and be happy together.

676
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:09,009
What is this strange mood?

677
00:53:15,117 --> 00:53:16,775
Good job.

678
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:29,039
You did a good job today,
so I'll treat you to dinner.

679
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,349
- Really?
- Yes.

680
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:32,108
- Joon, you're paying?
- Of course.

681
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,322
What should we eat?

682
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:43,809
What is this?

683
00:53:43,809 --> 00:53:45,619
What should we do?

684
00:53:56,838 --> 00:53:59,842
When did you all prepare this?

685
00:54:06,637 --> 00:54:09,027
I'd better film this.

686
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,170
<i>Good job!</i>

687
00:54:26,108 --> 00:54:29,166
<i>We are already so grateful.</i>

688
00:54:29,923 --> 00:54:32,657
<i>Even if you don't pass...</i>

689
00:54:34,246 --> 00:54:36,797
<i>we won't ever forget this.</i>

690
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:43,443
You put in so much work for us.

691
00:54:48,923 --> 00:54:51,492
Hurry. Come on.

692
00:54:52,405 --> 00:54:54,407
Put it there.

693
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:59,329
- Is it done?
- Okay.

694
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,117
Wow.

695
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,978
We're done. We're done.

696
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:11,916
We're treating you to pork belly.

697
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:13,119
Treating you!

698
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,918
Let's go eat some hot pork belly!

699
00:55:14,918 --> 00:55:17,036
- Pork belly?
- Hot?

700
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:18,686
- So hot.
- Oh...

701
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:22,061
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

702
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:25,246
<i>My heart is on fire because of you.</i>

703
00:55:25,246 --> 00:55:28,715
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

704
00:55:28,715 --> 00:55:31,094
<i>In front of love, I am melting.</i>

705
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,572
Wow.

706
00:55:33,228 --> 00:55:36,409
They're not my family or friends.

707
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:39,192
Not even the woman I love.

708
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:44,416
Why are they making me so emotional?

709
00:55:45,369 --> 00:55:47,208
They're your colleagues.

710
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,405
Yes, coming!

711
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:57,447
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

712
00:55:57,447 --> 00:55:59,686
Why aren't you coming?

713
00:55:59,686 --> 00:56:01,458
I'm coming.

714
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:06,248
<i>Oh, so hot, so hot.
Oh, so hot, so hot.</i>

715
00:56:13,228 --> 00:56:16,545
Then with a unanimous vote...

716
00:56:20,574 --> 00:56:22,300
<i>[Pass]</i>

717
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,650
Next is Byun Hyuk.

718
00:56:37,112 --> 00:56:39,851
- Hey.
- Let's say a cheer.

719
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:41,998
From battle to practice!

720
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:44,057
From practice to battle!

721
00:56:44,057 --> 00:56:45,965
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

722
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,418
Wow.

723
00:56:54,418 --> 00:56:56,548
Was soju always this good?

724
00:56:56,548 --> 00:56:58,518
It's much cleaner than liquor.

725
00:56:58,518 --> 00:57:00,728
Did you just figure that out now?

726
00:57:00,728 --> 00:57:03,057
Here. Have this.

727
00:57:10,432 --> 00:57:14,713
Mister Kim, thank you for
buying the pork belly today.

728
00:57:14,713 --> 00:57:16,945
Is that what's going on?
All right, I'll treat.

729
00:57:16,945 --> 00:57:18,858
Wow. Yeah!

730
00:57:18,858 --> 00:57:21,438
Yeah!

731
00:57:22,561 --> 00:57:24,650
He's not a normal applicant.

732
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,820
Splitting his money in half.

733
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,496
That's ridiculous humanism.

734
00:57:29,496 --> 00:57:32,039
This doesn't suit Gangsu Foods.

735
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:36,670
If we try to keep a monopoly,
we will fall into ruin one of these days.

736
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:40,489
It's important to be
sensitive and ethical.

737
00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:43,139
I think it's a good mindset to have.

738
00:57:46,492 --> 00:57:50,893
Then since it is not unanimous...

739
00:57:50,893 --> 00:57:53,574
I will put him in the fail pile.

740
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:17,989
So, have the decisions been made?

741
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:20,762
What happened to Hyuk?

742
00:58:34,226 --> 00:58:37,231
<i>He failed in the unanimous vote.</i>

743
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:50,847
So, I used my wild card.

744
00:58:50,847 --> 00:58:52,708
Wild card?

745
00:58:54,481 --> 00:58:56,539
Then that means...

746
00:58:57,483 --> 00:59:01,369
I don't think re-signing
your contract will work out.

747
00:59:01,369 --> 00:59:04,541
Did Byun Hyuk, that kid, pass?

748
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,954
That's how it worked out.
See you next time.

749
00:59:07,954 --> 00:59:09,668
Wait.

750
00:59:43,893 --> 00:59:47,322
Here it is, Father. I passed.

751
00:59:48,699 --> 00:59:52,240
Please directly hire the cleaning staff
just as you promised.

752
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,952
- Also...
- What now?

753
00:59:54,952 --> 00:59:58,219
Allow them to eat in the cafeteria.

754
01:00:11,364 --> 01:00:12,432
Shall we go?

755
01:00:52,976 --> 01:00:54,230
Hello.

756
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:59,166
I'm the Strategic Team intern, Byun Hyuk.

757
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:01,623
Let's work well together.

758
01:01:10,382 --> 01:01:11,818
Good morning.

759
01:01:11,818 --> 01:01:14,659
I'm Baek Joon,
who has been re-instated today.

760
01:01:16,175 --> 01:01:18,951
Let's work well together, Manager.

761
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,585
Oh, that's great!

762
01:01:26,585 --> 01:01:29,762
You two really did it.

763
01:01:29,762 --> 01:01:32,757
I'm glad to see you back.

764
01:01:33,492 --> 01:01:36,623
It would've been good if you got
the internship too though.

765
01:01:36,623 --> 01:01:37,641
Yeah.

766
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:45,657
Hello. I'm Baek Joon.

767
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:47,568
Please sit.

768
01:01:52,445 --> 01:01:54,505
Tell us your positive trait.

769
01:01:54,505 --> 01:01:58,335
Mine is that I have
many types of work experience.

770
01:01:58,335 --> 01:01:59,625
What kind of experience?

771
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:04,384
I have paid my own tuition and
expenses since first year of college.

772
01:02:04,384 --> 01:02:07,233
I've had many part-time jobs.

773
01:02:07,233 --> 01:02:11,974
From tutoring students, being a
hotel maid, and a catering server...

774
01:02:11,974 --> 01:02:14,775
Tiling at construction sites,
designated driving

775
01:02:14,775 --> 01:02:17,576
doing sales at the mall,
and being a barista.

776
01:02:17,576 --> 01:02:20,472
I think I've had more experience
than most my age.

777
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:25,132
Perhaps, you're not good at
sticking at one thing.

778
01:02:25,132 --> 01:02:30,311
I like to think I'm a multi-player
who can do many things at once.

779
01:02:31,271 --> 01:02:34,014
What's your motivation
for applying for Gangsu Foods?

780
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:38,768
I had to prove that I wasn't a coward.

781
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:42,230
Not to anyone else, but myself.

782
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:46,307
You're a coward.

783
01:02:51,005 --> 01:02:53,235
I've done that now.

784
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:55,443
Coming this far was enough.

785
01:02:55,443 --> 01:02:57,851
Do you have any last words
you want to say?

786
01:02:58,918 --> 01:03:01,007
Do not choose me.

787
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:07,188
I will not be an intern here.

788
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:16,516
Why are you being so stubborn?

789
01:03:16,516 --> 01:03:17,570
About what?

790
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:20,539
You got notice that you passed,
so why didn't you go into work?

791
01:03:20,539 --> 01:03:22,903
Why did you go back there?

792
01:03:23,588 --> 01:03:26,126
I told you that I think
full-time work is silly.

793
01:03:26,126 --> 01:03:28,947
And working as
a contract cleaner is okay?

794
01:03:28,947 --> 01:03:32,447
I'm different than the others.
I'm only a part-time contract worker.

795
01:03:32,447 --> 01:03:34,849
It's just about freedom. That's all...

796
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:37,998
I can leave whenever I want.

797
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:42,762
How sincere are you?

798
01:03:43,298 --> 01:03:45,697
- What do you mean?
- With Hyuk.

799
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:49,103
I'm asking if you're interested in him
as more than a friend.

800
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:55,297
Why do I have to tell you that?

801
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:58,572
Because it bothers me.

802
01:03:59,637 --> 01:04:01,039
Why?

803
01:04:01,574 --> 01:04:03,809
Why would it bother you?

804
01:04:10,797 --> 01:04:13,784
Did you forget?
I'm in charge of looking after Hyuk.

805
01:04:13,784 --> 01:04:16,592
I should know what the people
around Hyuk are thinking.

806
01:04:16,592 --> 01:04:21,135
So, you need to know
my feelings on Hyuk too?

807
01:04:21,135 --> 01:04:22,751
Is that it?

808
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,806
Answer me.

809
01:04:25,806 --> 01:04:29,284
Do you... like Hyuk?

810
01:04:29,284 --> 01:04:31,914
<i>Yes, I do like it.</i>

811
01:04:31,914 --> 01:04:35,094
Mix coffee, drip coffee,
espresso. I like it all.

812
01:04:35,094 --> 01:04:37,914
Oh, really? Then go make some.

813
01:04:37,914 --> 01:04:39,885
- Me?
- Yes, you.

814
01:04:39,885 --> 01:04:42,474
The intern should go.
Should I do it, then?

815
01:04:42,474 --> 01:04:44,396
Yes, I will.

816
01:05:05,978 --> 01:05:08,824
Here you go. Recharge yourself.

817
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:13,340
- Oh, Byun Hyuk.
- Yes?

818
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,960
This is one of the companies
we work with.

819
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,760
Get them to stamp this with their seal.

820
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,900
I should do it?

821
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,751
Yes, it's not hard at all.
Just get them to stamp it.

822
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:25,260
Think of it as
your first job as the intern.

823
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,550
You can do a good job, right?

824
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,710
Of course. I can do a good job.

825
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,108
Take a look here.

826
01:05:31,108 --> 01:05:35,018
Here, here, and here.

827
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:37,215
Get them to stamp it
with their legal seal.

828
01:05:38,418 --> 01:05:41,092
- You know what that is, right?
- Yes.

829
01:05:43,827 --> 01:05:45,347
I'll succeed and return.

830
01:05:45,347 --> 01:05:48,913
So, the factory is
in Gyeonggi-do, Anseong?

831
01:05:48,913 --> 01:05:51,260
Get a car from the admin team.

832
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,938
Yes, I will.

833
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,778
This is your first task?

834
01:06:01,778 --> 01:06:04,280
Yes, I just need them
to stamp their seal.

835
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,889
Still, they gave this to an intern?

836
01:06:06,889 --> 01:06:09,329
Yes, I just need to get it stamped.

837
01:06:09,329 --> 01:06:14,130
I just don't think this will be
easy to get resolved on your own.

838
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:17,264
It's okay. I just
need to get it stamped.

839
01:06:18,528 --> 01:06:20,230
Why are you here anyway?

840
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:22,990
Could you possibly be
my designated driver?

841
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:24,190
A driver? Why?

842
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:27,974
My license is suspended
until the end of the month.

843
01:06:27,974 --> 01:06:29,545
Could you help me?

844
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,572
Answer me.

845
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:36,862
Do you... like Hyuk?

846
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,605
Okay. 50,000 won, deal?

847
01:06:41,605 --> 01:06:43,101
Deal.

848
01:07:02,369 --> 01:07:04,679
I think this is the right place.

849
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:07,565
No one's here though.

850
01:07:12,335 --> 01:07:13,894
Joon.

851
01:07:13,894 --> 01:07:16,724
You shouldn't just go in there.

852
01:07:16,724 --> 01:07:18,360
Is anyone here?

853
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,639
Joon...

854
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:21,525
Excuse me!

855
01:07:28,889 --> 01:07:30,411
Anyone here?

856
01:07:31,217 --> 01:07:32,836
Is no one here?

857
01:07:32,836 --> 01:07:34,045
Joon.

858
01:07:38,143 --> 01:07:39,396
It's open.

859
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:46,253
Hello.

860
01:07:49,422 --> 01:07:52,702
Is it okay to just go in? Is this okay?

861
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:54,594
Is no one here?

862
01:08:07,552 --> 01:08:09,119
What's wrong, Joon?

863
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:30,280
