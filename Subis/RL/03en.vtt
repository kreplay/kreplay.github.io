<i>[Episode 3]</i>
Joon, you're here to help me?

4
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,756
You came on your own?

5
00:00:57,756 --> 00:01:02,098
So, you were worried about me,
weren't you?

6
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:04,813
No, I'm here because of money.

7
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:06,019
Huh?

8
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,052
<i>Joon.</i>

9
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:14,108
<i>Don't make important decisions
in your life based on money.</i>

10
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,840
You know, the world...

11
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:22,007
it doesn't always work out
the way you think it will.

12
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:28,281
I felt I had no choice and ended up
making a cowardly decision.

13
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,777
I hope you don't live the way I do, Joon.

14
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,364
<i>I didn't know what
he had meant by that back then.</i>

15
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:41,019
<i>Dad, you were right.</i>

16
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:43,862
<i>The world doesn't always
work out the way I want.</i>

17
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,243
<i>Young Ho got very injured.</i>

18
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:50,313
<i>I need 10 million won.
What can I do?</i>

19
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:53,212
<i>The only person
your mom can ask is you.</i>

20
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:05,825
I'm busy enough living my own life.

21
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:07,819
Why would I worry about
some rich guy like you?

22
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:10,860
I came because of money.
You have a lot of money.

23
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,312
How much do you need?

24
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:16,139
In return for getting you out of here...

25
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,050
I think I'll charge
about five million won.

26
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,151
How about it?

27
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:23,326
- Five million won?
- Yes, five million.

28
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:27,430
Is that too much?

29
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,664
In return, I have a condition too.

30
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:35,013
What's the condition?

31
00:02:35,013 --> 00:02:39,906
Until I can go home...
will you stay by my side, Joon?

32
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:44,373
I have to be on the run for now.

33
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:48,139
I'll pay you the average salary
of a Gangsu Group secretary.

34
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:50,996
<i>How frustrated do you think
I am to be doing this?</i>

35
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:53,289
<i>Think of it as helping me out.</i>

36
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,020
<i>Isn't there somewhere
you could get money?</i>

37
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:56,881
<i>Joon.</i>

38
00:02:58,062 --> 00:03:02,104
<i>Don't make important decisions
in your life...</i>

39
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:04,824
based on money.

40
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,294
What do you think about my offer?

41
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,104
<i>But, Dad...
Do you know what?</i>

42
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:22,626
<i>Important decisions
don't exist in my life.</i>

43
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:25,485
<i>I'm just trying to survive, day by day.</i>

44
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,072
I'm in.

45
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:38,079
Then is today our first day?

46
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,118
Yes, our first day.

47
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,467
<i>First day?</i>

48
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,280
What are you guys talking about?

49
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,058
Byun Hyuk! Hey, Byun Hyuk!

50
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:51,686
There's a back exit in the garage.

51
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:53,362
Wait for us there.

52
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:55,099
Wait, a back exit?

53
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:57,008
Hey, Baek Joon.

54
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:03,742
We're heading down now.

55
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,360
Get in. Hurry, hurry.

56
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:24,107
Excuse me.

57
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:41,459
Joon? We're alone, right?

58
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,944
- Are we in the elevator?
- Be quiet!

59
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,322
I'll join you.

60
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:02,105
What's going on?

61
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,225
You know that suite room?

62
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:22,449
Yes?

63
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:26,709
Is this the guest staying there?

64
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:30,189
Oh... I really don't know.

65
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,050
Really? Please take a closer look.

66
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,324
Why look again?

67
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:36,776
It's my first time seeing that person.

68
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,822
Sorry.

69
00:06:58,403 --> 00:06:59,466
It's all right.

70
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:08,315
Oh, there must be a mosquito in here.

71
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,365
Oh my.

72
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:14,637
It's very hot.

73
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,009
If you happen to see this guest,
could you please contact...

74
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,608
Sorry, but it's against
the hotel rules to do so.

75
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,764
Still, if you could cooperate...

76
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:27,086
We're not allowed to talk about
guests to external parties.

77
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:28,853
Think of it as doing a good thing...

78
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:30,343
I said that I can't!

79
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,906
I'm sorry... sorry.

80
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:27,360
Hold up, there.

81
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,072
Wait!

82
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:34,442
Hold on!

83
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,596
Hey!

84
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:40,761
Move. Get out of the way.

85
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,586
Excuse me.

86
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:50,317
What are you doing here?

87
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:53,878
You can't just come in here.

88
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:55,157
Sorry.

89
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:03,965
- Where is he?
- Jae Hoon!

90
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:05,652
Oh, where is Kwon Jae Hoon?

91
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:07,471
Jae Hoon, Jae Hoon!

92
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:09,000
- Hey, hey!
- Jae Hoon!

93
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:14,975
Get in!

94
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,111
You should've turned
your phone off beforehand.

95
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:32,682
Who would message me at a time like that?

96
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,302
<i>Hyuk, why can't I contact you?</i>

97
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,966
<i>Let's meet up and talk. Huh, huh?</i>

98
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,873
Chae Ri, why are you doing this to me?

99
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,375
Chae Ri? Who's that?

100
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,854
- You don't need to know.
- You don't need to know.

101
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:46,192
Anyway, Baek Joon.
Why did you suddenly get involved?

102
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:48,091
What's this about "first day"? Tell me.

103
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:50,839
Oh, Joon agreed to be
my personal secretary.

104
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,048
Who said you can?

105
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,865
She's my secretary,
so it's up to me.

106
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:57,005
Hey, you're not in the position
to make decisions like that.

107
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:59,014
I'm the one who's looking after you.

108
00:10:59,014 --> 00:11:01,015
I have to take responsibility
if anything happens.

109
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:02,566
- So, I can't?
- You can't.

110
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,384
That agreement is void.
There's no contract either.

111
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:06,556
Don't you know that
verbal contracts are binding too?

112
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:08,797
Yeah, we shook on it too, right?

113
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:10,878
Joon, you can't handle Hyuk.

114
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,370
You do it, so why can't I?

115
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,750
Drunk driving, disturbance
in clubs, public urination...

116
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,908
Can you handle that?

117
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,308
What? Public urination?

118
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:18,846
What happened with that was...

119
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,232
I don't care. That's nothing.

120
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:21,913
- Really?
- You still can't.

121
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:23,082
I won't allow it.

122
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,331
Are you looking down on me,
by any chance?

123
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:28,660
Why do you always twist
my words around like that?

124
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,802
Is it an inferiority complex?

125
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:31,009
Inferiority?

126
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,111
Hey, do you think anyone who doesn't
work for a big company feels inferior?

127
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,187
Why bring up a big company?

128
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:38,052
Why bring up inferiority?

129
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:40,371
Hey, I'm sorry!
Sorry to interrupt here.

130
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:42,259
Joon is an employee of
Gangsu Group today.

131
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,828
Joon, your inferiority
can go to the dogs.

132
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:46,298
- Stay out of it!
- Stay out of it!

133
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:50,558
Do you think we would've escaped
the hotel if weren't for me?

134
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,609
I worked really hard
to get rid of that cop.

135
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:55,183
I had to go endure
someone's gas too.

136
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,499
Joon is right about that.

137
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,320
The hotel escape was perfect.

138
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,600
If it was so perfect,
why is a police car following us?

139
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,033
- A police car?
- What?

140
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,995
What do we do?

141
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:23,259
He followed us.

142
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,909
Step on it, Jae Hoon!

143
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,451
Hold on tight.

144
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:39,923
What's with him? Is he a terminator?

145
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:41,075
Why does he keep coming?

146
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:42,715
What are you doing? Go faster.

147
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:44,629
Jae Hoon is like that. He never speeds.

148
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:46,287
Look at him now.
He's still not speeding.

149
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:49,966
You want to leave your picture on the
speeding cameras when you're on the run?

150
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:52,306
This isn't going to work.
Take a right around that corner.

151
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:54,025
We'll get off at that intersection.

152
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:55,875
I'll stop once I turn
so you can get out.

153
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,087
No! I want to get out with Joon too.

154
00:12:58,087 --> 00:12:59,958
You're a wanted man.
Why would you go with her?

155
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,235
He could safer with me.

156
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:02,842
I'm his personal secretary
starting today.

157
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:05,091
He's a third generation rich guy.
You're just a section chief.

158
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:06,571
- You can't say no.
- Just a section chief?

159
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:09,383
Can you stop referring to me
as the third generation rich guy?

160
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:25,442
He's telling us to stop, right?

161
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:31,115
Step on it, Jae Hoon!

162
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:37,842
What should we do?

163
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:40,143
Should we all get caught,
or will you let us out?

164
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:42,015
- Jae Hoon!
- Hurry.

165
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,888
Gosh, seriously!

166
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:06,778
Move your car!

167
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:10,107
Mister, move your car!

168
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:36,109
<i>Vehicle license plate 7684.
7684, pull over.</i>

169
00:14:36,768 --> 00:14:38,697
<i>7684, pull over.</i>

170
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:40,567
<i>Pull over.</i>

171
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,258
What's the problem?

172
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,548
Please cooperate for a moment.

173
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,538
Could you please open your trunk?

174
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:00,812
Where did they go?

175
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:01,958
What do you mean?

176
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,633
You picked up some people
from the hotel earlier.

177
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:07,322
Picked up some people?
I never did that.

178
00:16:07,322 --> 00:16:10,337
If you're done with everything,
may I get going?

179
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:16,812
You went over the speed limit.
May I see your ID?

180
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:18,528
I don't think I was speeding.

181
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:20,192
You were speeding.

182
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:24,038
If I was speeding,
there was a camera.

183
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:25,700
I'm sure I'll get a ticket notice.

184
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,519
I'll be careful in the future.
I'll be going, then.

185
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,273
Oh, what a relief.

186
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:46,528
Oh...

187
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,448
It's finally just the two of us.

188
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,158
Where are we going now?

189
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:03,423
A perfect place for
a third generation rich guy to hide.

190
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,877
Where's that?

191
00:17:28,142 --> 00:17:30,368
This is the good hiding place
you were talking about?

192
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:33,368
Where else is a better hiding place
for a third generation rich guy?

193
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:37,131
I'd rather go to prison than here.

194
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:40,336
Yeah? Do what you want, then.

195
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:45,046
Let's go to Han River instead.

196
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:46,538
I have a yacht there.

197
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:48,736
There aren't many people there,
so it's perfect.

198
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:50,977
They even have champagne.
It's sparkling and--

199
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,502
I'm late, right. I'm so sorry.

200
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:55,409
- Joon.
- I'm sorry.

201
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:00,630
Mister Byun, you came back.

202
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,971
I thought you'd quit after a day.
You're tougher than I thought.

203
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:06,144
I'm glad you came back, young man.

204
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:10,211
Of course, a young man
shouldn't give up after one day.

205
00:18:10,211 --> 00:18:12,445
Please stop that, Madam.

206
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:15,423
Why do you keep touching
the butt of someone's precious son?

207
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:18,663
That's right.

208
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:21,432
I'm not the kind of person
who should work in a place like this.

209
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:22,605
A place like this?

210
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:23,922
Today, we're doing bricks.

211
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:28,124
In order to move all those bricks today,
we can't waste any time.

212
00:18:28,904 --> 00:18:30,623
B... bricks?

213
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,407
This isn't right, is it?

214
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,917
Do I have to do this?
Please save me.

215
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:42,778
You blend right in.

216
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:44,358
It really suits you to be here.

217
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:45,522
- Work hard.
- Work hard.

218
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:47,712
- Work hard.
- Hurry up and get to it.

219
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,683
What?

220
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:02,920
What do I do?

221
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,113
I must be crazy.

222
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:08,933
I helped a wanted criminal escape.

223
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:15,126
Even if I needed money,
I shouldn't help a criminal.

224
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:18,634
I held his hand in front a cop
and helped him run.

225
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:21,402
At this rate,
will I end up being arrested?

226
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:32,702
<i>[Kwon Jae Hoon]</i>

227
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:38,032
What? What is it?

228
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:40,438
Where are you right now? Are you safe?

229
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:41,703
Don't worry.

230
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:43,792
I'm taking good care of the
third generation rich guy.

231
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,954
Tell me where you are.
I'll pick him up now.

232
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:48,522
You don't need to do that.
I'm busy, so I have to hang up.

233
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:50,502
Busy?

234
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:54,439
What are they doing that they're busy?

235
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:56,946
So, where's Hyuk?

236
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,964
He escaped for now.

237
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,303
He escaped for now?

238
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:02,143
Where to?

239
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,444
I used a third party to help out.

240
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:09,539
That person will contact me
once he arrives at a safe place

241
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:10,593
so don't worry.

242
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,049
What third party?

243
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:18,789
It's temporary, so don't worry about it.

244
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:23,753
Come in.

245
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:28,404
It's all ready to go.

246
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:35,305
Didn't I tell you?

247
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:37,842
We're having a press conference.

248
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:51,780
It's me.

249
00:20:52,214 --> 00:20:55,163
I need you to trace an IP for me,
as soon as possible.

250
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:57,001
Make sure you keep this secure.

251
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:13,275
Joon.

252
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:16,438
What are you doing?
Move... move.

253
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,628
- Okay.
- Move.

254
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:24,026
Oh, it stings so much!

255
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:26,856
Joon, Joon! Joon, Joon, Joon!

256
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:29,446
I got hurt. I'm injured!

257
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:37,535
Go.

258
00:21:50,246 --> 00:21:52,259
He's exactly like a mutt.

259
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:55,378
He's a mutt that
follows his owner around.

260
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:05,922
What are you doing?

261
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:09,952
Follow me.

262
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:32,148
Eat up.

263
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:34,910
You want me to eat this?

264
00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:38,492
You have to eat in order to work.

265
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:41,976
Is there anything that's grilled?

266
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:43,847
I don't like meat in stews.

267
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:45,496
Just eat it, would you?

268
00:22:47,797 --> 00:22:49,856
<i>These lumps I cannot identify.</i>

269
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,987
<i>This soup that looks like
an excessive, jumbled mess.</i>

270
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:55,386
<i>Is this also Joon's soul food?</i>

271
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:59,536
<i>I do not want it,
but in order to bond with Joon</i>

272
00:22:59,536 --> 00:23:01,454
<i>I will just go for it.</i>

273
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,068
<i>[Exquisite]</i>

274
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:19,162
What is this?

275
00:23:19,162 --> 00:23:23,635
This taste that is common,
yet has such incredible depth.

276
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:27,366
What is this soup that
captures my appetite so easily?

277
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:28,615
What else?

278
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,618
It's the sweet taste of honey that
a person who sweats gets to have.

279
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,162
Ah... oh my.

280
00:23:43,307 --> 00:23:46,012
Please turn up the volume on that.

281
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:50,179
<i>Gangsu Group is addressing the issue
of the recent airplane disturbance.</i>

282
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,919
<i>They are making an apology to the nation.
Here is the press conference.</i>

283
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:23,221
<i>We offended all of you
with this disturbing incident.</i>

284
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:26,086
<i>We are very apologetic.</i>

285
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,711
We wish to reveal the truth
of the matter as soon as we can.

286
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,798
We believe it is the right thing to
heal the wounds we have caused.

287
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:37,011
Unfortunately,
the perpetrator of the incident...

288
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:39,136
<i>has currently cut off communications.</i>

289
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:44,605
Cut off communications?

290
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:49,803
<i>Once we find his location...</i>

291
00:24:49,803 --> 00:24:54,599
we will do our best to help
the law deal with this matter.

292
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:58,484
As a representative of Gangsu Group...

293
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:01,744
I want to apologize again.

294
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,537
The oldest son seems fine.

295
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:24,959
It was always the younger son
who was the problem in that family.

296
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:28,900
The apology is all a show, too.

297
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,221
The rich are innocent,
the poor are guilty.

298
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:33,959
You can do anything
with money in this world.

299
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:37,853
What's the use of all that money?
Their child is a useless troublemaker.

300
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:39,474
I don't envy them at all.

301
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,269
Even so, a useless troublemaker?

302
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:46,304
Aren't you being too harsh?

303
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:49,402
He might have his reasons
that he can't talk about.

304
00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:51,131
What kind of reasons?

305
00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:52,833
He should turn himself in if he's wrong.

306
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:55,684
He might've tried
and his father stopped him.

307
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:58,826
He might have fists like Mike Tyson.

308
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:09,125
What, you think he was beaten up?

309
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:10,971
No...

310
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:13,924
I'm just saying, he could've been.

311
00:26:13,924 --> 00:26:14,953
Hey.

312
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:20,417
Are you the second son
of Gangsu Group's CEO?

313
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:28,249
I don't think so!

314
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,807
You're just a part-timer
at a construction site.

315
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:34,057
What do you know to take that guy's side?

316
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:36,642
Whether that troublemaker
gets beaten up or not

317
00:26:36,642 --> 00:26:39,957
and whether he goes to prison or not,
just worry about your own future.

318
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:41,036
Yeah.

319
00:26:45,574 --> 00:26:46,771
Everyone!

320
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,078
The CEO will be here in 10 minutes.

321
00:26:50,078 --> 00:26:52,499
So, eat quickly and get out.

322
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:54,058
- Hurry up!
- Gosh...

323
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:13,577
Special treatment,
avoiding responsibility...

324
00:27:13,577 --> 00:27:15,653
"The rich are innocent,
the poor are guilty."

325
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:17,758
Don't feel upset by it.

326
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:21,788
That's just how you rich people
look to normal folks like us.

327
00:28:00,737 --> 00:28:02,598
You're Section Chief Kwon Jae Hoon.

328
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,288
Why don't we go somewhere quiet?

329
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:07,585
This seems quiet enough.

330
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:12,775
It seems you've exclusively
been in charge of Mister Byun Hyuk.

331
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,195
Where is he right now?

332
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:18,356
It's the police.

333
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,234
The police?

334
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:24,650
He's not someone who officially
works in the company.

335
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,549
Why would I be in charge of him?

336
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:30,425
It is his personal life.

337
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:33,239
Isn't that why you were
at the hotel earlier today?

338
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:39,789
I don't know anything more
than what was said at the briefing.

339
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:43,701
I understand.

340
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:52,528
Ah, if he is determined to be missing,
we will issue a warrant.

341
00:28:53,493 --> 00:28:54,853
I am aware.

342
00:28:54,853 --> 00:28:59,029
Do you realize that
you will become a witness soon?

343
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:06,991
Goodbye, Officer Jang Chul Min.

344
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:16,118
Oh yes.

345
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:19,969
About that press conference...

346
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:24,596
His brother apologized
on behalf of his younger brother.

347
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,042
It's strange enough
for a family member to do it.

348
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:31,175
Isn't it weird to apologize
on behalf of the employees?

349
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:35,627
What did the hard-working
employees do so wrong?

350
00:29:35,627 --> 00:29:37,096
I don't really understand it.

351
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,134
You're right.

352
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:47,825
I found that point problematic, as well.

353
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:52,056
Well... please make sure
to pay your fine.

354
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:08,788
<i>Who are you to explain anything?</i>

355
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:10,907
<i>Who would believe anything you say?</i>

356
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,532
<i>Don't say a single word
and don't do anything!</i>

357
00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:19,152
<i>Just do what I tell you to
and go shrivel up somewhere.</i>

358
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:28,221
You are the most useless punk.

359
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:32,590
You are a punk who doesn't
know how to do anything!

360
00:30:33,094 --> 00:30:34,559
You little punk!

361
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:39,461
Unfair? What could be unfair for you?

362
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:42,494
<i>Unfortunately,
the perpetrator of the incident...</i>

363
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,184
<i>has currently cut off communications.</i>

364
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:49,347
On behalf of Gangsu Group's employees

365
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,134
I would like to apologize again.

366
00:30:55,163 --> 00:30:57,223
Special treatment,
avoiding responsibility...

367
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,035
"The rich are innocent,
the poor are guilty."

368
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,434
Don't feel upset by it.

369
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:05,375
That's just how you rich people
look to normal folks like us.

370
00:31:16,845 --> 00:31:18,753
The weather sure is nice.

371
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,297
Oh. Wow.

372
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:38,840
Gosh.

373
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:45,268
The site is quite a mess.

374
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:48,336
You have to hurry it up,
or how will we finish in time?

375
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:03,574
I know you may not be happy,
but we're doing our best.

376
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:06,826
Do you know how big my loss is
if our construction increases by a day?

377
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:08,751
As the foreman of the
construction site...

378
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:17,291
Don't talk to me about doing your best.

379
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:20,000
Show me some determination and ambition.

380
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,010
Are there any people
who don't work hard and just get paid?

381
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,750
Are there those who steal materials?

382
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,971
There is no one like that
at our site, Chairman.

383
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:52,055
Then why does it look
the same every time I come?

384
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:54,246
The work is not progressing. It's not!

385
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:56,654
That doesn't mean
we can do shoddy construction.

386
00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:01,145
It's more important to build it strong
than to build it quickly.

387
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,164
- That's right.
- Of course.

388
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:06,742
If we rush in order to meet deadlines
and things go wrong with the building

389
00:33:06,742 --> 00:33:08,951
what will you do if
the building crumbles later on?

390
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:12,160
Nice to see you.

391
00:33:12,913 --> 00:33:13,993
Goodbye.

392
00:33:28,034 --> 00:33:30,240
Did I tell you to do shoddy construction?

393
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,165
I told you to do your best.

394
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:35,211
You're pretty much telling us to.

395
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:36,307
That's enough.

396
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:37,824
Do you know this?

397
00:33:37,824 --> 00:33:41,005
It's against the law to push
for shoddy construction.

398
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,663
How are you managing your employees?

399
00:33:55,663 --> 00:33:58,352
Can't you do construction without
using crazy people like that?

400
00:33:58,352 --> 00:34:00,531
- She works very hard.
- So, what?

401
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:04,596
Will construction stop
if you get rid of that one girl?

402
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,650
Baek Joon, leave this afternoon.

403
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,240
- How could he tell her to leave?
- What?

404
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,347
For what reason?

405
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:18,166
Are you firing me? Why?

406
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,347
Be quiet.

407
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:21,338
This is disruption of business.
Get rid of her.

408
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:23,317
Hey, this is wrong.

409
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:25,695
Hey, this isn't right!

410
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,302
What kind bullcrap is this?
Let go of me now!

411
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:32,865
I may be a daily worker,
but I have my rights.

412
00:34:32,865 --> 00:34:34,447
This is illegal!

413
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:38,856
You should've taken the law exam
if you like law so much.

414
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:40,657
Why are you working here?

415
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:43,007
Oh my goodness. What do we do?

416
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:45,327
- You can't do this.
- Stop it.

417
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,306
Joon!

418
00:35:34,148 --> 00:35:35,655
Chairman.

419
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:37,929
Catch that punk!

420
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:42,887
Byun.

421
00:35:56,235 --> 00:35:57,751
Give this to Hyuk.

422
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:02,114
He can't use cards under his name,
and he must need this and that.

423
00:36:02,114 --> 00:36:03,378
I will.

424
00:36:04,811 --> 00:36:07,784
I feel at peace knowing that he has you.

425
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:11,184
I will make sure nothing happens to him.

426
00:36:11,184 --> 00:36:15,467
Is Hyuk still dating Chae Ri,
by any chance?

427
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,585
Ah, I don't really know.

428
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:22,146
He's not dating anyone else, right?

429
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,695
Who would he be dating at this time?

430
00:36:24,695 --> 00:36:27,007
Don't worry about that kind of thing.

431
00:36:31,693 --> 00:36:33,112
<i>[Byun Hyuk]</i>

432
00:36:35,331 --> 00:36:36,532
What's wrong?

433
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,737
Jae Hoon, my friend.

434
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:41,012
My friend... my friend.
(In French and Japanese)

435
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:48,132
Hurry up and come.

436
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,221
Let's go.

437
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:09,989
We got a call. What's going on?

438
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:11,811
This is a case of attempted murder.

439
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:12,914
What?

440
00:37:15,135 --> 00:37:18,737
This punk threw a brick this big
at me from the fifth floor.

441
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,119
As you can see here, I nearly died.

442
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,568
Attempted murder? That's ridiculous.

443
00:37:23,568 --> 00:37:26,487
Ah, they are accomplices.

444
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:28,405
What a load of crap.

445
00:37:28,405 --> 00:37:29,851
What did our Joon do wrong?

446
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:32,771
Joon was busy being
dragged off at that time.

447
00:37:32,771 --> 00:37:36,043
This guy was trying to screw me over
because that wench got fired!

448
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:37,333
They're together.

449
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,983
I don't appreciate how you keep
calling her a wench.

450
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,755
What? You little...

451
00:37:42,755 --> 00:37:45,864
You attempted to murder me,
so who are you to talk?

452
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,907
You keep saying attempted murder.

453
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:51,054
Do you have evidence? Any witnesses?

454
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,782
- You all saw, right?
- Yes.

455
00:37:53,782 --> 00:37:56,063
Did you see him
throw a brick at me or not?

456
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:58,411
Yes, I saw. It hit me first.

457
00:37:58,411 --> 00:38:00,135
What attempted murder?

458
00:38:00,135 --> 00:38:02,583
Yeah, you really are overreacting.

459
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:05,315
Who here saw Mister Byun throw a brick?

460
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:07,054
- I didn't.
- Me neither.

461
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:10,351
What's with all of you, seriously?

462
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:12,822
Don't any of you want to work anymore?

463
00:38:13,451 --> 00:38:14,650
Listen here.

464
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,293
Is it not enough to fire me?
You're threatening to fire everyone?

465
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:21,079
You're threatening us with our jobs.

466
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,378
- You're trying to force false testimony.
- What?

467
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:25,682
Anyway, no one here threw a brick.

468
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:26,793
No one.

469
00:38:26,793 --> 00:38:29,911
My employees caught this punk
on the fifth floor.

470
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:32,280
- That's correct.
- We caught him.

471
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,411
Were you on the fifth floor?

472
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:36,478
- No, he was on the fourth floor.
- Yes, fourth floor.

473
00:38:36,478 --> 00:38:39,097
Yes, the fourth floor of the basement
and it was windy.

474
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:40,621
Fourth floor of the basement, yeah right!

475
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:43,340
Are you all going to continue lying?

476
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,492
You people are all too much.

477
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,331
<i>What is it with these people?</i>

478
00:38:47,331 --> 00:38:50,425
<i>Why are they standing up for me?</i>

479
00:38:50,425 --> 00:38:51,454
Be quiet!

480
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,215
Why can't you make a decision?
Is this how you work?

481
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:55,833
He's a criminal caught in the act!

482
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,498
What do you mean?
Where's your evidence?

483
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:00,632
Wearing protective gear
on site is critical.

484
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:04,063
People who don't wear anything
are negligent too.

485
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:05,614
Watch what you're saying, old man!

486
00:39:05,614 --> 00:39:08,054
Old man, old man?

487
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,987
Who do you think you're talking down to?
How old are you?

488
00:39:10,987 --> 00:39:13,146
How old are you, kid!

489
00:39:37,076 --> 00:39:39,175
Stop, stop! That's enough.

490
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:42,577
Stop! All right, all right!

491
00:39:43,096 --> 00:39:44,833
All right, everyone.

492
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,583
Let's go in and talk.

493
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,001
We are talking right now.

494
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:50,541
No, I mean the police station.
Take them in.

495
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:52,391
No, no, no!

496
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:58,322
Fine, I won't stand idly by
if you all behave this way.

497
00:39:58,322 --> 00:39:59,398
Joon.

498
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,583
What will you do, then?

499
00:40:03,048 --> 00:40:06,237
You illegally disposed of industrial
waste in the middle of the night.

500
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,634
When it was raining last time,
you secretly disposed of it in the sewer.

501
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:14,048
I'll report it to the ward office
and to city hall.

502
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:16,213
What do you think
will happen then, CEO Min?

503
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,771
Watch your mouth,
you little wench.

504
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:22,670
If I report illegal waste disposal,
he will get charged, right?

505
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,110
Yes, he will.

506
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,838
It's the truth, isn't it?

507
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,063
You want to get mixed up with me?

508
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:31,951
Then say it's not attempted murder.

509
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:33,554
You little...

510
00:40:33,554 --> 00:40:35,240
Oh, what's this?

511
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,175
Who are you?

512
00:40:40,175 --> 00:40:41,650
He... he's my friend.

513
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,748
Jae Hoon.

514
00:40:47,856 --> 00:40:49,016
Let go now.

515
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:52,586
Why don't we go and talk?

516
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:03,547
He looks very handsome.

517
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,237
Is he Joon's boyfriend?

518
00:41:05,237 --> 00:41:07,891
No, he's my friend.

519
00:41:07,891 --> 00:41:10,903
He must work in a good place.
He looks very clean cut.

520
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,293
Madam Ahn, you're really something.

521
00:41:13,293 --> 00:41:16,454
He could end up at the police station
and you're thinking about his looks?

522
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:19,335
Don't worry. That won't happen.

523
00:41:19,335 --> 00:41:22,184
Jae Hoon is an expert.

524
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,409
- An expert.
- Yes, an expert.

525
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,226
Gosh...

526
00:41:29,525 --> 00:41:33,753
Treatment cost and even money
for emotional distress damages.

527
00:41:33,753 --> 00:41:36,358
I will give you more
than enough settlement money.

528
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:38,817
What are you talking about?

529
00:41:38,817 --> 00:41:41,204
We're the ones who need damages
for emotional distress.

530
00:41:41,204 --> 00:41:44,708
He always shows up during lunch
and rushes everyone.

531
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:47,778
He ignores all labor laws and
fires people whenever he wants.

532
00:41:47,778 --> 00:41:50,260
We're the ones who deserve damages
for emotional distress.

533
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,570
Let's not leave any paperwork
and make things complicated.

534
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,333
CEO Min Sang Ho.

535
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:05,893
- Do you know me?
- No.

536
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:07,471
Not very well.

537
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:09,719
So I looked into you on my way here.

538
00:42:09,721 --> 00:42:14,911
You have a few paper companies
besides this construction company.

539
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,148
That's all for tax evasion, isn't it?

540
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:28,844
You've used the supposed wages to
make a nice slush fund for yourself.

541
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:35,186
Wow.

542
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:44,358
You punk... who are you?

543
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:47,518
There's no need for you to know.

544
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,628
Why don't you settle?

545
00:42:58,882 --> 00:43:01,257
Well, we understand then.

546
00:43:01,257 --> 00:43:02,351
Thank you.

547
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,432
He really is skilled.

548
00:43:16,434 --> 00:43:18,260
He wasn't even in there for 10 minutes.

549
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:20,474
How did he get CEO Min to stay quiet?

550
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:23,204
What did I tell you?
I told you Jae Hoon would resolve it!

551
00:43:23,204 --> 00:43:25,954
That's the level my friend is at.

552
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:29,650
What the heck were you thinking?

553
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,391
- Huh?
- What happened with the brick?

554
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:35,621
Oh, it was actually because
of a dandelion seed flower.

555
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:37,402
- What?
- Oh...

556
00:43:37,402 --> 00:43:39,994
It had grown even in the cement.

557
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:42,512
You know how I like to blow on the seeds.

558
00:43:43,532 --> 00:43:45,539
I had no idea there was a brick there.

559
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:48,175
So, it was just an accident.

560
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:49,246
Accident.

561
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:52,766
Just like drunk driving and
the club disturbances were?

562
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:55,335
Of course, they all were accidents.

563
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:58,061
The public urination
and Yeon Hee were accidents too?

564
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:02,262
Joon, why are you being scary?

565
00:44:02,262 --> 00:44:04,023
They really were all accidents.

566
00:44:07,987 --> 00:44:09,925
- I was crazy.
- Huh?

567
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:13,579
No matter how much I need the money,
I shouldn't have agreed to help you.

568
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,889
Why are you being this way?

569
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:18,371
Forget it. Let's end it here.

570
00:44:18,371 --> 00:44:19,670
End it?

571
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:22,719
- What?
- I won't be your personal secretary.

572
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:25,217
Let's just head down our own paths.

573
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,697
Joon!

574
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,039
That's enough.

575
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,630
Joon seems really angry.

576
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,818
Stop and get in the car!

577
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:57,922
<i>[Mom]</i>

578
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:07,123
<i>[Mom]</i>

579
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:16,239
Mom, I'm sorry.

580
00:45:17,422 --> 00:45:19,061
I can't give you that money.

581
00:45:20,298 --> 00:45:22,300
So, stop calling me.

582
00:45:40,996 --> 00:45:43,416
Why does everything I do
turn out this way?

583
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:47,164
Even if someone set out to cause trouble

584
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,253
it'd be hard to cause as much as you.

585
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:52,324
I just wanted to
let the dandelion seeds fly.

586
00:45:54,344 --> 00:45:56,304
Was that so wrong?

587
00:45:57,083 --> 00:46:00,099
You nearly ended up at the police
station because of dandelion seeds.

588
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:02,503
Those people almost
lost their livelihoods.

589
00:46:02,503 --> 00:46:04,177
Of course, she'd be mad.

590
00:46:06,143 --> 00:46:07,699
I was wrong.

591
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,659
What do I do now?

592
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:15,737
What do I do in order
to get Joon to forgive me?

593
00:46:18,844 --> 00:46:20,003
Dream on.

594
00:46:20,003 --> 00:46:22,313
Once Joon is done, she means it.

595
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:25,657
It didn't even make sense that she
agreed to be your personal secretary.

596
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:29,838
Unless she loses her mind,
she will probably never do it again.

597
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:32,155
Is that right?

598
00:46:42,347 --> 00:46:43,896
This is from your mom.

599
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:54,668
Jae Hoon!

600
00:46:54,668 --> 00:46:56,606
- What now?
- Joon.

601
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:58,516
How to make her not angry...

602
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,480
I thought of a way.

603
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:12,380
Don't come here anymore.

604
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,733
- What?
- What?

605
00:47:14,742 --> 00:47:16,699
What do you mean by that?

606
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:18,184
Stop coming tomorrow?

607
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:19,503
It's CEO Min's orders.

608
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,362
The three of you and Baek Joon
should not come in.

609
00:47:22,362 --> 00:47:26,134
Foreman, I thought
this issue was settled earlier.

610
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,393
The brick issue was settled.

611
00:47:28,393 --> 00:47:30,166
But not all of you.

612
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:31,608
But, still...

613
00:47:31,608 --> 00:47:34,014
how can you suddenly fire us like this?

614
00:47:34,014 --> 00:47:37,295
I'm supposed to pay for my daughter's
private academy this month.

615
00:47:37,295 --> 00:47:40,804
If you were worried about that,
you shouldn't have gotten involved.

616
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:42,947
Why would you take that kid's side?

617
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:44,572
What were we supposed to do?

618
00:47:44,572 --> 00:47:47,543
He's a young guy with a bright future
and it was an accident.

619
00:47:47,543 --> 00:47:50,134
Should we leave him to get
dragged off for attempted murder?

620
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:52,902
Why don't you talk to CEO Min for us?

621
00:47:52,902 --> 00:47:55,126
I don't know anything.
That's just how it is.

622
00:47:55,126 --> 00:47:56,503
Don't come tomorrow.

623
00:47:56,503 --> 00:47:58,751
I'm short on labor as it is.

624
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,070
Foreman, Foreman.

625
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:04,827
Of all the things I've seen in my life,
this is the worst case of abuse.

626
00:48:04,827 --> 00:48:07,135
Hey, you think this is
the only place to work?

627
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:08,666
It is. This is the only place.

628
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,813
That's why we stuck around here.

629
00:48:10,813 --> 00:48:14,485
Hey, I'll just eat less and live shorter.

630
00:48:14,485 --> 00:48:16,664
I won't bow down to you!

631
00:48:16,664 --> 00:48:21,342
Eat well and live well,
you awful bastards!

632
00:48:21,342 --> 00:48:24,217
What do we do?
Madam Ahn, Mister Kim, Mister Lee.

633
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:26,744
I should never have brought him around.

634
00:48:26,744 --> 00:48:28,552
I am so sorry.

635
00:48:28,943 --> 00:48:31,894
Why are you sorry?
You don't have to be.

636
00:48:32,414 --> 00:48:35,253
We can find another job.

637
00:48:35,253 --> 00:48:36,606
Yes, yes.

638
00:48:36,606 --> 00:48:40,077
He said it was
because of dandelion seeds.

639
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:45,440
Even though it was an excuse,
wasn't it cute and naive?

640
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,257
Anyway, they say you should rest
when things go wrong.

641
00:48:49,257 --> 00:48:50,793
Since things have gone wrong...

642
00:48:50,793 --> 00:48:53,195
I'll just rest and look for a new job.

643
00:48:53,195 --> 00:48:55,175
Yeah, don't worry too much.

644
00:48:55,175 --> 00:48:57,431
- Don't worry.
- Yes, yes.

645
00:48:57,431 --> 00:49:00,610
Life is about earning
and living day to day.

646
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,244
Yeah, that's true.

647
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,072
It's okay.

648
00:49:30,027 --> 00:49:31,192
All right.

649
00:49:35,244 --> 00:49:36,425
Okay.

650
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:55,373
One, two, three.

651
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:08,166
What is it?

652
00:50:09,135 --> 00:50:13,025
Are you here to beg
on your knees and say sorry?

653
00:50:13,606 --> 00:50:15,844
Kim Ki Sub, Lee Tae Kyung,
and Ahn Mi Yeon...

654
00:50:16,067 --> 00:50:17,985
please reinstate the three of them.

655
00:50:18,646 --> 00:50:20,032
Who are they?

656
00:50:20,032 --> 00:50:22,514
The three people you fired earlier today.

657
00:50:22,514 --> 00:50:24,630
Give them their jobs back.

658
00:50:24,976 --> 00:50:28,697
Otherwise, I'll go through with
my threat on the illegal waste disposal.

659
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:30,733
I will officially report you.

660
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:35,083
So, you won't report me
if I give them their jobs back?

661
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:39,215
You have evidence?

662
00:50:39,751 --> 00:50:41,820
You think I'd come to make a deal
without evidence?

663
00:50:48,235 --> 00:50:50,960
You know that punk
who threw a brick at me?

664
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,961
I hear he's the second son
of Gangsu Group.

665
00:50:56,226 --> 00:50:59,192
I was so shocked by that.

666
00:51:01,322 --> 00:51:03,061
Go on and report me.

667
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:06,766
I can send him into a cave
with just one call.

668
00:51:08,621 --> 00:51:10,074
Do as you please.

669
00:51:10,074 --> 00:51:12,170
He has nothing to do with me.

670
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,266
Oh...

671
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:16,927
You don't care even if his life ends?

672
00:51:16,927 --> 00:51:19,887
Getting the jobs of those three people
back is more important to me.

673
00:51:19,887 --> 00:51:21,074
Really?

674
00:51:21,074 --> 00:51:22,672
Yes, it is.

675
00:51:25,746 --> 00:51:28,673
What are you doing with my phone?

676
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:31,181
Let me go.
I said let me go!

677
00:51:31,181 --> 00:51:33,362
Give it back. Give it back!

678
00:51:33,362 --> 00:51:34,447
There's nothing.

679
00:51:35,887 --> 00:51:37,351
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

680
00:51:37,811 --> 00:51:39,900
I'm sure there's nothing regarding that.

681
00:51:40,735 --> 00:51:42,132
Wow.

682
00:51:44,717 --> 00:51:47,753
You threatened me with a lie?

683
00:51:47,753 --> 00:51:49,494
It's enough just to fire me.

684
00:51:49,494 --> 00:51:51,853
Give the three people their jobs back!

685
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,922
Then tell me where that punk is.

686
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,246
Then I'll give those
three people their jobs back.

687
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:10,472
Tell me where he is.

688
00:52:13,746 --> 00:52:16,284
Do you understand, kid?

689
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:19,309
This is a real deal.

690
00:52:24,795 --> 00:52:27,181
I can go out on my own.

691
00:52:30,713 --> 00:52:33,045
How can you throw my phone like that?

692
00:52:36,228 --> 00:52:37,277
Buy a new one.

693
00:52:37,277 --> 00:52:40,166
Use the rest of the money
for candy, you baby.

694
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:45,657
Hey... hey!

695
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,769
You think money is everything? Hey!

696
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:52,224
Open the door!

697
00:52:52,893 --> 00:52:55,903
Open the door now. Hey!

698
00:53:18,311 --> 00:53:19,512
Make a decision.

699
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,931
You want to get
their jobs back, or is it him?

700
00:53:28,126 --> 00:53:30,445
Do you think Gangsu Group will stand by

701
00:53:30,445 --> 00:53:33,000
if they know you
threatened Hyuk like this?

702
00:53:33,675 --> 00:53:36,556
You came to ask for their jobs back.

703
00:53:37,824 --> 00:53:39,739
Now you're worried about him?

704
00:53:40,331 --> 00:53:41,536
Who are you?

705
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:44,318
Are you his girlfriend?

706
00:53:50,329 --> 00:53:52,141
I'm sorry...

707
00:53:53,257 --> 00:53:54,775
Madam Ahn.

708
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:57,108
Mister Kim.

709
00:53:58,291 --> 00:53:59,963
Mister Lee.

710
00:55:19,557 --> 00:55:20,951
How much do you need?

711
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:29,304
Tell me. I'll lend it to you.

712
00:55:29,304 --> 00:55:30,588
Why would you?

713
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:33,938
Who are you to lend me money?

714
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:35,849
You said you did it for money.

715
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:38,094
That's why you took a crazy job
like being Hyuk's secretary.

716
00:55:38,094 --> 00:55:40,561
I said I won't do it. I'm quitting.

717
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:43,652
So, I'll lend it to you.
How much do you need?

718
00:55:45,715 --> 00:55:49,208
Hey... I don't want it.

719
00:55:50,364 --> 00:55:53,454
You run errands for
a third generation rich guy.

720
00:55:53,454 --> 00:55:56,335
I refuse to take money
that's earned like that.

721
00:55:56,335 --> 00:55:57,737
Got it?

722
00:56:20,728 --> 00:56:22,521
Ta-da!

723
00:56:30,072 --> 00:56:31,606
What do you think?

724
00:56:31,606 --> 00:56:33,172
You're surprised, right?

725
00:56:34,338 --> 00:56:35,539
Thanks to you

726
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:39,199
I was able to know the special sweet
taste of food after working up a sweat.

727
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,039
So, I wanted to give you a gift.

728
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:44,677
For you, after you've had
a tiresome day...

729
00:56:44,677 --> 00:56:47,519
a romantic and heavenly taste.

730
00:56:53,186 --> 00:56:55,449
These are grade A ribs.

731
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:58,255
This is the chef, Mister Yoon.

732
00:56:58,255 --> 00:57:01,349
This is wine from the year we were born.

733
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:07,572
I didn't know which roses
you liked, so I got pink.

734
00:57:07,572 --> 00:57:09,268
There are probably about a thousand.

735
00:57:09,268 --> 00:57:12,643
Quite a lot, right? I know.

736
00:57:13,695 --> 00:57:15,561
Do you like it?

737
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:18,181
Come here, Joon. Come here.

738
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:25,184
What's wrong, Joon?

739
00:57:25,896 --> 00:57:29,420
Are those tears
because you're so touched?

740
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,827
Are they not?

741
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:35,146
Because of a guy who only knows
how to spend his damn money...

742
00:57:35,146 --> 00:57:38,115
Because I was trying to save you...

743
00:57:38,115 --> 00:57:42,766
Because I was trying to hide you,
do you know what I just did?

744
00:57:45,197 --> 00:57:47,983
Joon, what's wrong?
Did something happen?

745
00:57:47,983 --> 00:57:52,525
Mister Kim, who got fired because of you,
has three kids to raise.

746
00:57:52,525 --> 00:57:56,273
Mister Lee pays more than one million won
of his mother's hospital fees a month.

747
00:57:56,273 --> 00:58:00,695
Madam Ahn's husband had a stroke
and she's taking care...

748
00:58:01,255 --> 00:58:05,748
She's taking care of her entire family.

749
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:06,777
Joon.

750
00:58:06,777 --> 00:58:11,358
This may be nothing
but a lowly job to you.

751
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:14,657
It was a desperately needed source
of livelihood for them.

752
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:19,038
They were worried that
you would lose that livelihood!

753
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:21,608
They put everything on the line.

754
00:58:24,449 --> 00:58:28,516
I thought you would, at least,
have a conscience about that.

755
00:58:28,516 --> 00:58:31,418
Is this all you could think to do?

756
00:58:33,027 --> 00:58:36,775
If they knew they got fired for taking
sides with a some rich troublemaker

757
00:58:36,775 --> 00:58:39,498
they'd feel so taken aback by it all.

758
00:58:45,507 --> 00:58:46,992
To tell you the truth, Joon...

759
00:58:46,992 --> 00:58:49,351
I was thankful to them too.

760
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:53,512
I prepared an envelope for each of them.

761
00:58:53,512 --> 00:58:55,204
Here.

762
00:58:56,114 --> 00:58:58,742
You think you can
solve everything with money?

763
00:58:58,742 --> 00:59:00,943
Huh? Why not money?

764
00:59:00,943 --> 00:59:03,282
Everyone likes it.

765
00:59:03,282 --> 00:59:07,704
Why did someone like you
appear in front of me?

766
00:59:07,704 --> 00:59:09,449
Why did you show up?

767
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:12,425
Why did you destroy everything? Why!

768
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:14,730
Destroy?

769
00:59:15,248 --> 00:59:16,610
I did?

770
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,099
I'm asking you this favor.

771
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:21,519
Please... please return
to the world you came from.

772
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:23,639
Stop making things hard
for so many people.

773
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:26,233
Please just get lost!

774
00:59:50,523 --> 00:59:52,090
Get lost?

775
01:00:21,996 --> 01:00:25,230
Who said you can run this business here?

776
01:00:27,855 --> 01:00:29,438
Who are you people?

777
01:00:30,204 --> 01:00:32,079
Where are you from?

778
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,166
Look here, Baek Sung Ki.

779
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:41,199
You can't do this
to CEO Byun Gang Su.

780
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:45,164
You made a living off
of him for this long.

781
01:00:45,164 --> 01:00:50,251
When you left the company,
you got a nice retirement package.

782
01:00:50,251 --> 01:00:53,610
You should be repaying him for that.

783
01:00:54,391 --> 01:00:57,681
Why would you be tackling work
that the head office does?

784
01:01:03,045 --> 01:01:04,588
Take this.

785
01:01:04,588 --> 01:01:09,280
Don't cause a problem
out of this issue anymore.

786
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,757
The CEO...

787
01:01:12,311 --> 01:01:14,175
is watching you.

788
01:01:14,175 --> 01:01:16,586
Stay in line, punk.

789
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,914
Oh, aren't you pretty?

790
01:01:31,028 --> 01:01:33,186
Listen to your dad.

791
01:01:46,891 --> 01:01:48,702
Joon.

792
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:55,193
Don't make important
decisions in your life...

793
01:01:56,601 --> 01:01:59,039
based on money.

794
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:04,512
I felt I had no choice and ended up
making a cowardly decision.

795
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,559
But, Joon...

796
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:12,199
I hope you don't live the way I do.

797
01:03:15,536 --> 01:03:20,943
<i>I was so happy to meet you
that I insisted it was fate.</i>

798
01:03:20,943 --> 01:03:23,240
Stop making things hard
for so many people.

799
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,702
Please just get lost!

800
01:04:00,634 --> 01:04:03,452

801
01:04:03,452 --> 01:04:05,971

01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:07,190
Got it?

803
01:04:18,086 --> 01:04:20,951
<i>Until you called out my name...</i>

804
01:04:20,951 --> 01:04:25,358
<i>I did not make a single movement.</i>

805
01:04:37,934 --> 01:04:41,369
<i>When you called out my name...</i>

806
01:04:41,369 --> 01:04:46,936
<i>for the first time...
I became a flower.</i>

807
01:05:16,976 --> 01:05:21,773
<i>Please, call me by my name,
which suits my color and fragrance.</i>

808
01:05:21,773 --> 01:05:23,833
<i>Not "third generation rich guy."</i>

809
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:26,572
What's he saying? Crazy punk.

810
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:39,164
Hey, have you seen Hyuk?

811
01:05:39,164 --> 01:05:40,969
I don't know.

812
01:05:44,469 --> 01:05:46,536
This was taped here.

813
01:05:51,173 --> 01:05:52,855
What's this?

814
01:05:57,773 --> 01:05:59,378
Here he comes!

815
01:06:04,304 --> 01:06:06,152
Joon!

816
01:06:06,152 --> 01:06:09,052
Joon... look.

817
01:06:23,637 --> 01:06:25,751
