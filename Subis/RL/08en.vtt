00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,702
Where?

00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:26,326
<i>[Episode 8]</i>
Seman Foods in Anseong.

6
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,248
He went there
to terminate their contract.

7
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:31,100
You sent an intern alone to do
something like that?

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,387
What about it?
It was Director Seol's order.

9
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:37,017
What? Managing Director Seol?

10
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:45,801
<i>This is your first test, Byun Hyuk.</i>

11
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:48,396
<i>How will you pass this test?</i>

12
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:56,380
Hello!

13
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:03,021
Can we just go in like this? Is it okay?

14
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,680
Is no one here?

15
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:19,549
What's wrong, Joon?

16
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,950
- What are you doing? Hurry.
- Okay.

17
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,245
- Come hold him up.
- Okay.

18
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:43,599
All right. Yeah.

19
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:49,370
Hey, hurry up. Joon, hurry.

20
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,938
- Okay.
- Joon, faster.

21
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:56,218
Oh, this hurts.

22
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:07,873
Are you all right?

23
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:15,530
Mister, are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?

24
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:18,919
You have to live no matter what.
You have to live and see it through.

25
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,950
Don't you have family, mister?

26
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:23,729
Don't you have parents or children?

27
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:26,855
I... I want to live.

28
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,066
I want to live!

29
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,568
But, I can't do this,
no matter how hard I try.

30
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:34,490
What am I supposed to do?

31
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,585
President!

32
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:43,741
President! President!

33
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,621
President, what is this?

34
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:50,353
Why did you do this?

35
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:52,693
Get up, please. Get up.

36
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:59,634
What are we
supposed to do if you do this?

37
00:03:30,324 --> 00:03:31,667
What just happened?

38
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:34,325
What did we see?

39
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:43,681
You two are out here.

40
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,531
Is the president okay?

41
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:48,622
He would've been in big trouble if
you'd come even a bit later.

42
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:51,711
You two saved his life.

43
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,139
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,509
No problem.

45
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:57,394
Shouldn't he go to the hospital?

46
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:00,443
Yes, his family is coming soon.

47
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:03,675
But... who are you again?

48
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:07,086
I'm here from the Strategic Planning
team of Gangsu Foods.

49
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:10,495
Gangsu Foods?

50
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:12,949
I don't know if this is the right
situation for it...

51
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:14,782
but I came to get this stamped
with a seal.

52
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:23,576
Get out. Get out!

53
00:04:23,576 --> 00:04:25,711
How dare you come in here?

54
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:29,740
I was just told to get these
stamped with a seal.

55
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,961
Get lost, you jerks. Get out of here!

56
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:42,151
Looks like the talks didn't go so well.

57
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:45,014
Gosh, he just said to get them stamped.

58
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:49,596
Let's go, Joon.

59
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:50,706
Okay.

60
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:03,427
That's why you need to come to
an agreement and get it done.

61
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:04,668
How can I do that?

62
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:07,822
That's a matter of your skill,
Byun Hyuk.

63
00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:09,651
Here's a new contract.

64
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,869
Does this make sense?
I have to come to an agreement with him.

65
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:15,598
How can I do that?

66
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,970
Can they do this, Jae Hoon?

67
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,172
Do I have to resolve
work issues for you now too?

68
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:22,091
Figure out your own work problems.

69
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:25,276
That president was hanging himself
and I was just there.

70
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:27,211
I was like this and this.

71
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:29,617
Then I did this and barely
managed to save him.

72
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:31,822
I don't know him, but that president...

73
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:39,526
I think he was doing that
because of this very contract.

74
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:43,658
So, how can I go back there and
asked him to stamp his seal?

75
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:51,271
How can you work if you're always
thinking about people's situations?

76
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:54,687
Since you're in the company now,
you need to take care of yourself.

77
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,487
He is so cold, as always.

78
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:08,660
If he stamps his seal,
the factory will probably shut down.

79
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:11,694
Why will they shut down?

80
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:16,377
Usually, they buy all the ingredients
to prepare for future orders.

81
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,468
The production line would be
set up in preparation of that.

82
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:23,358
But, Gangsu is suddenly terminating
the contract before production.

83
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:24,658
So they would have to shut down.

84
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:27,237
I have to get that seal stamped though.

85
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,637
Yes, you do.

86
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:31,108
That will ruin them.

87
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,197
Yes, it will.

88
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:36,980
Unless Gangsu Foods pays them
compensation for damages.

89
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,278
Compensation for damages?

90
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:39,879
What? Compensation for damages.

91
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,879
Yes, compensation for damages.
Can't we do it?

92
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,990
Why would we send you
if we were going to offer that?

93
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,511
We wanted to handle it quietly
without legal issues.

94
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,870
If we do it that way,
Seman Foods will close down.

95
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,879
- Who said that?
- Joon.

96
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,699
Hey, are you in a position to care
about subcontractors?

97
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,810
You're an employee of Gangsu Foods.

98
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,112
If you can't get that seal stamped,
everyone on our team will be blamed.

99
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,879
You might be safe since
you're the CEO's son.

100
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,478
Other people will get a black mark
for causing a loss to the company.

101
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,180
In severe cases, it's a demotion.
Do you know that?

102
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,391
Is that how things work?

103
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:25,533
What does Joon know about our
team to speak so carelessly?

104
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,048
Seriously...

105
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,360
Joon didn't do anything wrong.

106
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,557
She only answered
because I asked a question.

107
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,379
Oh, seriously.

108
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:46,904
Joon?

109
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:49,389
She called saying she can't come today.

110
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:52,048
Really? That's strange.

111
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:55,118
She was gone when
I went up this morning.

112
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,394
She's not answering her phone.

113
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:59,596
You don't know why
she's not here, do you?

114
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:01,206
We don't know.

115
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,682
Maybe she's visiting her father.

116
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:03,951
Her father?

117
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:06,672
Her father passed away long ago.

118
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:13,522
When she has a lot on her mind,
she has a habit of going to her dad.

119
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:15,263
Ah, I see.

120
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:21,263
What should I do?

121
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,586
If you can't get that stamped today,
don't even think about coming to work!

122
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:32,946
My goodness.

123
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:35,082
I told you I have nothing more to say.

124
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:37,428
Why do you keep showing up?

125
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:39,659
I'm not an employee of Gangsu Foods.

126
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:43,764
Oh, what is all of this?

127
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:46,774
Are these your meals?

128
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:48,940
Have you been filling up on soju?

129
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,466
Why does it matter to you?

130
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,336
Why wouldn't it matter to me?

131
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:54,384
I did save your life.

132
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:58,341
Nonetheless, I won't stamp my seal.

133
00:09:58,341 --> 00:10:00,902
Even with a knife to my throat, I won't.

134
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:05,499
It may seem like a drop in the bucket,
but I will sue for damages.

135
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:08,705
Yes, you should.

136
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:12,475
You should do everything you want...

137
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:15,955
except for dying.

138
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,812
Why would you die for them?

139
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:26,076
Why would you die to please them?

140
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:30,875
The moment you get weak,
you lose to them.

141
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,322
You can't sit back like this.

142
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:35,134
You have to hold on, no matter what.

143
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:39,827
How long can a person like me hold on?

144
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:42,995
I'm always in the same
sad state every day.

145
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:45,543
Don't get weak on me again.

146
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:47,426
You've worked hard all this time.

147
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:53,538
You were a subcontractor
for Gangsu Foods for over 20 years.

148
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:55,952
I know that was quite a feat.

149
00:10:55,952 --> 00:11:01,104
Back in the day, Gangsu Foods
wasn't this bad though.

150
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:06,000
When Manager Baek was around,
I was still dealing with real people.

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,844
He could protect us from
the abuse of the main contractor.

152
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:14,634
What's the use of saying these things?

153
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,758
I'm just kicking myself at this point.

154
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:20,884
Gosh.

155
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:25,537
Why is it that all the good people
pass away so early?

156
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:52,600
Joon.

157
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,485
Have I become the lead figure
in wielding abuse?

158
00:11:57,788 --> 00:11:59,644
It's not to that extent.

159
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,878
Um...

160
00:12:03,135 --> 00:12:07,157
To put it simply, you're like a tool.

161
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,009
You're an employee who has to do
what your bosses tell you to.

162
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:17,687
But, I wish you could be a little
different than other normal employees.

163
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:20,883
You want me to be different?

164
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:25,503
If you want to,
you have the strength to do it.

165
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,543
I do?

166
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:31,052
Even with the cleaning service
employees...

167
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:34,802
if you hadn't been there and
if it weren't for you

168
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:38,413
do you think we would have
the results we have today?

169
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:40,384
It's because it was you.

170
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:45,743
I believe the end result is what it
was because of you.

171
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:48,380
It happened because it was me?

172
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,355
Yes, because it was you.

173
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,542
Because it was you...

174
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,586
Because you changed your mind...

175
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:59,278
things we've been fighting against
for over 10 years were easily resolved.

176
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,326
It makes me very angry.

177
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:06,596
Yet, that is the reality.

178
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,620
I have to get to my part-time job.

179
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,779
I'm going to get going.

180
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,062
But, Joon...

181
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:39,778
I understand what you're trying to say.

182
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:44,942
I understand why you want me to be
different than other employees.

183
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:46,630
Because it's me and I'm me.

184
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,870
That's why the result was different.
I can understand that too.

185
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,971
But, the thing is...

186
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:54,475
suppose I change like you want me to.

187
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:59,173
What will happen then?

188
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,244
What do you mean?

189
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:04,283
If I really do change...

190
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:08,753
When that time comes...
will you see me as a man then?

191
00:14:12,072 --> 00:14:14,976
Do you... like Hyuk?

192
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,110
Will you do that?

193
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:30,404
Excuse me?

194
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,181
That girl.

195
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:36,596
That girl who came in when Hyuk was
getting beaten by Father, Baek Joon.

196
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:38,052
Do you know anything about her?

197
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:42,581
No, not really.

198
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:47,331
I heard she was there during
the brick incident with CEO Min.

199
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,052
You didn't see her when you went there?

200
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,763
I'm not sure.

201
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:56,226
She's a very suspicious girl.

202
00:14:56,226 --> 00:15:00,144
She's not the quality of girl that
Byun Hyuk would be around.

203
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:03,562
She's just the type cause trouble.

204
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:06,120
She has been bothering me.

205
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,322
The fact that Hyuk turned himself in
and started working as a cleaner...

206
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:13,951
Even going on about hiring them directly.

207
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,961
Now, he's become an intern.

208
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:20,841
This is not the Hyuk that I know.

209
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:22,120
Right, Section Chief Kwon?

210
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:32,201
Hyuk's actions have always
been difficult to predict.

211
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:34,551
You know that better than me, Chief.

212
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:38,812
Even so, he's never done this.

213
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:43,500
Can't you see that Hyuk has changed?

214
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,471
Since we're on the topic,
look into Baek Joon's background.

215
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:52,500
Find out who she is and
why she's always with Hyuk.

216
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,653
Okay?

217
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,990
Yes, I will.

218
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,158
Apartment 302. My place.

219
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:25,471
Beep, beep, beep. It's open.

220
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,172
Why isn't it opening?

221
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,750
<i>Why isn't it opening?</i>

222
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,499
<i>Beep, beep, beep.</i>

223
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:45,927
<i>Hello?</i>

224
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,835
<i>That's strange.</i>

225
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:50,816
<i>Beep, beep, beep.</i>

226
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:55,518
Why isn't it opening?

227
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:01,336
Hey there.

228
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:02,683
This is my place.

229
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:05,902
Beep, beep, beep.

230
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:08,107
Please stop, okay?

231
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:11,249
Really?

232
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,161
Oh, it's open.

233
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,846
I thought I was going to die.

234
00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:35,067
You! Why weren't you opening, door?

235
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:42,102
My head hurts.

236
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:08,277
You can't sleep here.

237
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:12,625
Don't bother me.

238
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,204
Wake up, okay?

239
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:26,251
Man, I'm going crazy.

240
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:28,653
Joon! Joon!

241
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:31,265
Joon.

242
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:34,113
Joon!

243
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,563
You have to give me an answer.
How can you just leave, Joon?

244
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:38,682
Joon!

245
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:43,719
Hyuk.

246
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:46,086
Yes, tell me whatever it is.

247
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:47,616
Tell me how you feel.

248
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:57,423
You're a good person.

249
00:18:57,423 --> 00:18:59,906
You're a good friend.

250
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,047
Also...

251
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:04,516
you were a good colleague too.

252
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,527
That's it?

253
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:11,506
Isn't that enough?

254
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:13,151
Joon.

255
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:17,490
I know that you're a good person and
we're already good friends.

256
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,377
Also, we were once good work colleagues.

257
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:23,555
I'm very thankful for that. Aren't you?

258
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:26,423
Of course, I'm thankful. But, Joon...

259
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:28,413
That's good, then.

260
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:30,723
Let's just go that far.

261
00:19:30,723 --> 00:19:32,095
I like you.

262
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:35,814
I like you too...

263
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:37,993
as a friend.

264
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:46,411
Ah, I have to go to work,
so I'm going to head up now.

265
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:47,576
Sleep well.

266
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:29,313
Ah, you scared me.

267
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,719
What are you doing there
like that in the dark?

268
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:37,721
You really scared me.

269
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:44,336
When a woman says she wants
to be friends with a man...

270
00:20:45,435 --> 00:20:49,397
that's a rejection, right?

271
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:52,240
Did Joon say she just
wants to be friends?

272
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,950
Is it because she's just shy?

273
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,479
She might be unable to express herself.

274
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,435
I know Baek Joon pretty well.

275
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:05,477
She doesn't play games
if she likes someone.

276
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:07,162
She's the type to tell the guy first.

277
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:11,260
No, you say that because you only know
Joon as a friend and not as a woman.

278
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,011
Joon may be sure of herself
and have strong opinions

279
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:17,730
but, she is not so sure
when it comes to dating.

280
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,333
Even when she likes someone,
she can't express her true feelings.

281
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,506
Are these feelings for real or what?

282
00:21:23,502 --> 00:21:25,144
She's the type to be conflicted.

283
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:26,864
That's it.

284
00:21:26,864 --> 00:21:28,392
She said she wanted to be friends?

285
00:21:28,392 --> 00:21:29,702
Well, that's...

286
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,438
Perhaps, that's because
we haven't progressed

287
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:37,251
beyond the stages of friendship.

288
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:38,804
Isn't that possible, friend?

289
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:40,468
Progress, yeah right.

290
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:41,768
Yes.

291
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:46,595
This is the time to show her
my intimate feelings.

292
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:48,795
Hey, you'll get in big trouble
with Section Chief Yang

293
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:50,596
if you don't get that stamp.

294
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:53,758
Nothing comes before love, my friend.

295
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,642
I'm going to take a shower.

296
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,260
Oh, my head hurts.

297
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,834
What? What is this?

298
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,771
What was that?

299
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:05,030
You, you! What are you doing?

300
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:11,057
<i>Get out! Get out! Get out!</i>

301
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:14,147
Hey, you! Get out!

302
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:15,704
Get out, you crazy punk!

303
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:17,057
Stop it!

304
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:19,028
Get out, crazy punk!

305
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:20,711
Hold on. Just hold on!

306
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:25,165
Calm down.

307
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:26,517
Where am I?

308
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:28,519
I asked you where I am.

309
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:31,795
Here? This is my place.

310
00:23:31,795 --> 00:23:34,684
What? What did you say?

311
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:47,134
Why I am here then?

312
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:51,585
You didn't kidnap me, did you?

313
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:52,865
What do you mean kidnap?

314
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,923
Then why am I here?

315
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:56,913
That's what I want to ask you!

316
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:00,795
- Get out.
- What?

317
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:03,101
Just get out!

318
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:06,472
<i>Get out!</i>

319
00:24:06,472 --> 00:24:07,836
Did you all hear that too?

320
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:09,428
What is it?

321
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:21,573
T... T-1000?

322
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:22,726
T-1000?

323
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,371
Ah, seriously.

324
00:24:26,371 --> 00:24:27,653
Why are you here?

325
00:24:27,653 --> 00:24:29,757
You're not here to catch me, are you?

326
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:31,107
Why would he catch you?

327
00:24:31,107 --> 00:24:32,999
Did you forget you went
to the prosecutor?

328
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:34,836
Yes, that's right.

329
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:36,257
Why are you here then?

330
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:44,875
Ha Yeon Hee, why are you
coming out from there?

331
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,576
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

332
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,125
Nothing happened
between us yesterday, right?

333
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,996
That's not true.

334
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:02,779
You forcefully entered my home.

335
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,828
- His home?
- Forceful entry.

336
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:11,470
Yes, but did anything
inappropriate happen?

337
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,662
On my honor as a policeman,
nothing like that happened.

338
00:25:14,662 --> 00:25:16,383
Are you satisfied?

339
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:17,949
I am satisfied with that.

340
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:22,490
Sorry, I drank a lot yesterday.

341
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,506
Well, then.

342
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:58,140
The new person on
the third floor is T-1000?

343
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:04,211
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

344
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:07,785
Kwon Jae Hoon saw
everything. What do I do?

345
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:10,945
I just don't know.

346
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,049
What a relief that Joon
is alone on the roof.

347
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:17,150
No matter how drunk she is,
she won't go into the wrong place.

348
00:26:19,856 --> 00:26:21,189
Isn't that right, Joon?

349
00:26:22,877 --> 00:26:27,087
I'm a designated driver,
so I wouldn't really be drunk anyway.

350
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:31,498
I'd like it if you would refrain
from driving so late, Joon.

351
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:42,307
I don't like that you work so hard, Joon.

352
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:46,729
Why don't you stop working so hard
and find a man to depend on?

353
00:26:53,189 --> 00:26:56,798
You... didn't brush your teeth, did you?

354
00:26:59,605 --> 00:27:01,257
Oh, sorry.

355
00:27:01,257 --> 00:27:03,449
I have to go to work.
I'm going to head back up.

Gosh.

Well, you must think you can work
slowly since you're the CEO's son.

No, it's not that at all.

get that seal stamped.

- Just to bury them...
- Hold on.

366
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:45,601
That's offensive to hear.
Are you calling me a jerk or what?

367

No, that's not what I meant.

and the subcontractor.

369
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:53,348
Isn't there a way for us to both win?

370
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:55,328
Shouldn't we think about it a bit more?

371
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:57,146
Don't think. Don't think at all.

372
00:27:57,146 --> 00:27:59,738
You can't even do this task,
so why do you keep thinking?

373
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:05,089
Geez, why did Director Seol tell me
give this task to an intern?

00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:23,420
So, you're going to get
the contract tomorrow?

529
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:28,007
Yeah, all I need to do
now is get that contract.

530
00:41:32,608 --> 00:41:34,777
You know, Joon...

531
00:41:34,777 --> 00:41:39,547
I never dreamed that this was how
my father's company was run.

532
00:41:39,547 --> 00:41:43,985
This is a product with no issues,
but our company is putting an end to it.

533
00:41:43,985 --> 00:41:45,757
The main contractor is being oppressive.

534
00:41:45,757 --> 00:41:48,949
Isn't there a systemic issue with
main contractors and subcontractors?

535
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:50,387
It's not a slavery contract.

536
00:41:50,387 --> 00:41:54,277
Why don't subcontractors have any rights?

537
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:56,436
I feel so bad for
President Jang who has no power.

538
00:41:59,655 --> 00:42:03,445
Yes, I do feel bad for him.

539
00:42:03,445 --> 00:42:06,009
He was wronged, as well.

540
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:08,264
Still, he has no choice but to let it go.

541
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:11,047
People in the powerless position have to.

542
00:42:11,047 --> 00:42:14,315
They could end up suffering
an even bigger loss if they don't.

543
00:42:17,413 --> 00:42:19,344
Why did Managing Director Seol...

544
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:23,264
give me this torturous task?

545
00:42:27,275 --> 00:42:28,733
Why do you think he did, Joon?

546
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:32,472
At the very least...

547
00:42:34,146 --> 00:42:39,378
I doubt it was just for you to know how
people feel wronged and end it there.

548
00:42:39,378 --> 00:42:42,835
In the end, you make
the decision with this task.

549
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:44,427
I do?

550
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:46,922
Yes.

551
00:42:46,922 --> 00:42:48,023
You do.

552
00:42:49,771 --> 00:42:51,242
<i>She said these words to me.</i>

553
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:56,650
I wish you could be a little different
than other normal employees.

554
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:59,168
<i>How?</i>

555
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:04,981
If you want to,
you have the strength to do it.

556
00:43:06,842 --> 00:43:09,440
<i>How is that you could say
those words to me, Joon?</i>

557
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:17,429
<i>Like an outsider, I've been latching
onto my father all this time.</i>

558
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:20,293
<i>I enjoyed life thinking what belonged
to my father was mine.</i>

559
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:25,181
<i>I really was just a third generation
rich guy with nothing going for me.</i>

560
00:43:57,733 --> 00:44:00,847
Yeah, what wrong have you done?

561
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:04,443
You're just an employee
who has to follow orders.

562
00:44:04,443 --> 00:44:06,862
You have no choice either, right?

563
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:13,052
Still, my heart was in pain seeing
you treat President Jang like that.

564
00:44:13,052 --> 00:44:17,315
Because you were being used as
a tool to abuse power.

565
00:44:18,925 --> 00:44:21,384
I'm a tool and a target.

566
00:44:21,384 --> 00:44:23,413
Who?

567
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:25,246
Who targets you?

568
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,367
You.

569
00:44:30,733 --> 00:44:32,108
You do it the most.

570
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:37,561
Oh, I do?

571
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:40,335
Sorry for all the trouble I caused.

572
00:44:40,335 --> 00:44:41,905
Stop causing trouble if you know.

573
00:44:41,905 --> 00:44:44,621
Okay, my friend. I'll try my best.

574
00:44:49,016 --> 00:44:50,692
But, my friend...

575
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:53,900
is there anything
that I can do right now?

576
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,039
What do you mean?

577
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,601
About Seman Foods?

578
00:44:57,601 --> 00:45:01,204
Of course not.
Just get the contract stamped.

579
00:45:02,585 --> 00:45:06,871
Why did Managing Director Seol
give me this task then?

580
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,331
It's one of two reasons.

581
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,400
Know yourself.

582
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,510
What else?

583
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,106
Know your place.

584
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:20,001
Well... don't they mean the same thing?

585
00:45:21,773 --> 00:45:25,675
It means you should realize
that you can't do much.

586
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:37,693
<i>That is what my friend said again.</i>

587
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:46,173
If you can't get that seal stamped,
everyone on our team will be blamed.

588
00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:49,215
You might be safe since
you're the CEO's son.

589
00:45:49,215 --> 00:45:54,043
Other people will get a black mark
for causing a loss to the company.

590
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,360
In severe cases, it's a demotion.
Do you know that?

591
00:45:58,565 --> 00:46:01,853
<i>How can both sides win?</i>

592
00:46:01,853 --> 00:46:03,894
<i>Is there really no way?</i>

593
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,594
<i>How will you split it?</i>

594
00:46:07,016 --> 00:46:10,077
I could give you
10 billion won right now.

595
00:46:10,077 --> 00:46:12,420
You can split that with your friend.

596
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,282
It's up to you how you split it.

597
00:46:16,282 --> 00:46:17,889
How will you split it?

598
00:46:19,048 --> 00:46:21,688
I will split it 50-50.

599
00:46:23,438 --> 00:46:25,056
What?

600
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:27,007
Was that it?

601
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:28,331
What are you saying?

602
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:30,331
I think I know the reason, Jae Hoon.

603
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,483
Hold on.

604
00:46:33,483 --> 00:46:35,201
Where are you going now?

605
00:46:35,201 --> 00:46:36,498
To work.

606
00:46:48,257 --> 00:46:49,809
You startled me!

607
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,449
Why are you here so late?

608
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:55,090
I need a designated driver, Joon.

609
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:56,918
A designated driver?

610
00:46:56,918 --> 00:46:59,289
- Where are you going at this hour?
- To work.

611
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:12,527
What are you doing?

612
00:47:13,724 --> 00:47:15,739
Why do you want to know?

613
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:17,753
Well, where's President Jang?

614
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:21,074
The office. Why?

615
00:47:24,715 --> 00:47:27,240
- This is all...
- Are you here to see us in ruin?

616
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,277
Give it to me.

617
00:47:28,277 --> 00:47:31,125
Yes, you'll get it soon.

618
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:34,684
Yes, please do that. Bye now.

619
00:47:41,934 --> 00:47:45,105
President Jang, what are you doing?

620
00:47:45,105 --> 00:47:49,253
What should I do with it? It'll rot soon.

621
00:47:49,253 --> 00:47:52,853
I bought lots of beef from
New Zealand just for Gangsu Foods.

622
00:47:52,853 --> 00:47:55,003
I'm selling it off for a low price.

623
00:47:55,003 --> 00:47:56,096
What?

624
00:47:58,568 --> 00:47:59,873
Oh yeah.

625
00:47:59,873 --> 00:48:03,293
I heard you're CEO Byun's son.

626
00:48:03,293 --> 00:48:05,012
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

627
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:10,268
Pretend you never heard me
cursing your father... Sir.

628
00:48:10,268 --> 00:48:14,818
Never mind that.
President, unload your truck now.

629
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:16,001
Why?

630
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:20,592
How can you make beef rice bowls
without the beef?

631
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:23,041
So, unload the truck right now.

632
00:48:24,967 --> 00:48:27,710
Why would I make those?

633
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:32,219
I stamped my seal on
the termination contract.

634
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:36,798
Yes, give this to Gangsu Foods.

635
00:48:36,798 --> 00:48:40,271
You should make the beef rice bowls.

636
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:44,221
Goodness, what if I do?
What do I do with them?

637
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:47,561
Put the brand Seman Foods
on them and sell them in the stores.

638
00:48:51,931 --> 00:48:55,204
Wait, would Gangsu Foods allow that?

639
00:48:55,204 --> 00:48:58,409
I'll be in charge of whether
they allow that or not.

640
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:00,952
Produce those beef rice bowls.

641
00:49:05,001 --> 00:49:07,097
Hyuk.

642
00:49:07,097 --> 00:49:10,878
You... you just said
you'd be in charge of it.

643
00:49:10,878 --> 00:49:13,309
Yes, I will.

644
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:16,507
I'm the one who makes
decisions in this matter.

645
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:28,536
What are you planning to do?

646
00:49:28,536 --> 00:49:32,376
Seman was our contractor for 24 years.

647
00:49:32,376 --> 00:49:34,739
That's long enough
to be considered a friend.

648
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:38,739
We should split it 50-50 with a friend.

649
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:41,208
Did Gangsu Foods allow this?

650
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:42,764
I should get permission now.

651
00:49:42,764 --> 00:49:44,878
First, we should terminate the contract.

652
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,518
What? You really got
the contract stamped?

653
00:49:53,518 --> 00:49:55,077
Take a look to confirm.

654
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,847
You should've done
this earlier. Good job.

655
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:08,847
Then Seman Foods has completely
terminated their contract with us, right?

656
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:11,577
Yes, it's completely terminated.

657
00:50:11,577 --> 00:50:16,731
What Seman Foods does has nothing to
do with Gangsu Foods anymore, right?

658
00:50:16,731 --> 00:50:19,666
It doesn't matter what they do,
so tell them to do what they please.

659
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:24,193
Really? You really said that,
Section Chief Yang.

660
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:27,389
They can do as they please...
as they please?

661
00:50:27,389 --> 00:50:30,891
Why do you keep asking
the same thing? I said yes.

662
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:33,530
Thank you for confirming,
Section Chief Yang.

663
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,449
How did it go?

664
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:02,340
It's your turn now.

665
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,420
Okay.

666
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:14,027
You're all here.

667
00:51:14,027 --> 00:51:16,083
Here. Drink this.

668
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:18,378
Thank you.

669
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:22,385
Do any of you want
a part-time job after work today?

670
00:51:22,385 --> 00:51:23,434
What kind?

671
00:51:23,434 --> 00:51:25,833
You know that president
from the subcontractor?

672
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,597
He started producing products.

673
00:51:27,597 --> 00:51:30,117
Their employees are very busy and
they're lacking manpower.

674
00:51:30,117 --> 00:51:33,664
I thought that factory
got their contract terminated.

675
00:51:33,664 --> 00:51:38,034
Hyuk wants to try and save the factory,
so he said to make the product.

676
00:51:38,034 --> 00:51:39,961
Did they get permission from the bosses?

677
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:42,344
Half yes and half no.

678
00:51:42,344 --> 00:51:43,697
You know how it is.

679
00:51:43,697 --> 00:51:46,144
Mister Byun is causing
trouble again, isn't he?

680
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:50,759
Because of the situation they're in,
they can't pay a lot.

681
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:54,942
Instead, they promise a bonus once
the products start selling.

682
00:51:54,942 --> 00:51:55,992
Bonus?

683
00:51:58,626 --> 00:52:01,219
Do any of you want to go?

684
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,485
Bonus! Bonus!

685
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:15,690
What's the matter, Madam Ahn?

686
00:52:16,764 --> 00:52:20,545
If only there had been
one person like Hyuk...

687
00:52:20,545 --> 00:52:24,411
our factory wouldn't have shut down.

688
00:52:28,748 --> 00:52:30,697
What do you mean?

689
00:52:32,197 --> 00:52:35,099
Madam Ahn's family had
a subcontracting factory too.

690
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:39,809
They shut down when
the main company terminated the contract.

691
00:52:39,809 --> 00:52:43,092
When she saw that president
getting kicked out...

692
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:46,418
She says it's bringing
back some memories.

693
00:52:46,418 --> 00:52:50,052
Lately, she's been crying all the time.

694
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:04,092
Joon, I'll go with you.

695
00:53:04,092 --> 00:53:05,963
I don't need to get paid.

696
00:53:05,963 --> 00:53:08,806
I'll happily go to help.

697
00:53:08,806 --> 00:53:12,880
Me too, but I need to get paid
even if it's a little.

698
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,751
I'll go too. I'll go for sure.

699
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:18,184
Thank you.

700
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,034
Thank you, everyone.

701
00:53:26,802 --> 00:53:30,313
So, did you find out
anything else about Baek Joon?

702
00:53:32,414 --> 00:53:34,742
There was nothing much to find out.

703
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:39,092
Really?

704
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:44,811
Yes, there was nothing
suspicious in her history.

705
00:53:44,811 --> 00:53:48,219
She grew up in a normal family and
was a normal college student.

706
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,449
Any connections to Gangsu Group?

707
00:54:01,449 --> 00:54:02,951
There was nothing.

708
00:54:11,927 --> 00:54:13,469
Baek Joon's father, Baek Sung Ki.

709
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,739
Why didn't you report it?

710
00:54:24,827 --> 00:54:26,614
Are you getting any other ideas?

711
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:31,900
Why? You feel bad
because Hyuk's your friend?

712
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,954
- It's not like that.
- Then what?

713
00:54:37,264 --> 00:54:40,166
I made a judgment call that it wasn't
something for you to worry about.

714
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:43,213
I don't need your judgment calls.

715
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,922
Just do what I tell you to, you punk.

716
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,539
Aren't you on my side to get
promoted quickly?

717
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:58,708
You know Hyuk very well.

718
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:01,570
He isn't the type to protect people
just because they're his friends.

719
00:55:15,025 --> 00:55:18,753
Don't lose focus because
of some useless sympathy.

720
00:55:18,753 --> 00:55:22,150
Think about yourself, okay?

721
00:55:30,985 --> 00:55:33,989
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

722
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:52,148
Don't worry.

723
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:55,300
The CEO said he'll
take care of everything.

724
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,041
Father!

725
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:07,509
Father.

726
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,469
Eat well and stay healthy.

727
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:14,806
Be well until I return.

728
00:56:14,806 --> 00:56:17,661
All right, Jae Hoon?

729
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,813
<i>Jae Hoon.</i>

730
00:56:37,768 --> 00:56:42,007
<i>My friend, mon ami, my pal.</i>

731
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:44,313
<i>I finally found out what I can do.</i>

732
00:56:51,936 --> 00:56:54,123
Oh, I'm going insane.

733
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,599
Hurry, hurry.

734
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:22,199
Keep it moving.

735
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,541
This is going well.

736
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:26,755
Oh my.

737
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:31,351
Take this box.

738
00:57:31,353 --> 00:57:33,335
Hurry. Go, go.

739
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,592
<i>[Gangsu Beef Rice]</i>

740
00:57:51,963 --> 00:57:54,661
Oh, Jae Hoon. You're here?

741
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,704
Producing our product without permission.

742
00:58:06,704 --> 00:58:09,905
Gangsu Foods will not let this go.

743
00:58:09,905 --> 00:58:11,829
President Jang.

744
00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:13,130
You should prepare yourself.

745
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:19,713
Gosh.

746
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:22,820
I'll talk to him.

747
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:25,237
Jae Hoon.

748
00:58:25,237 --> 00:58:27,465
What will we do?

749
00:58:29,726 --> 00:58:31,371
Hey, Jae Hoon.

750
00:58:33,423 --> 00:58:37,074
It wasn't without permission.
I told President Jang to do it.

751
00:58:37,074 --> 00:58:40,460
A Gangsu Foods employee gave
the product over to a subcontractor?

752
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,518
Are you crazy?

753
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,257
They can divide the profits
with Gangsu. Isn't that okay then?

754
00:58:44,257 --> 00:58:45,625
That makes no sense.

755
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:48,422
Gangsu Foods was going
to discontinue the item anyway.

756
00:58:48,422 --> 00:58:52,235
They will sell under the name Seman
and still divide profits with Gangsu.

757
00:58:52,235 --> 00:58:54,954
Isn't it too much
to say they can't do it?

758
00:58:54,954 --> 00:58:57,483
They don't want to do it,
but they don't want anyone else to.

759
00:58:57,483 --> 00:58:58,623
What is that?

760
00:58:58,623 --> 00:59:00,969
That's your simple-minded
way of thinking.

761
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:02,710
We have a new product being launched.

762
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,750
There's another product to compete
with that we didn't think of.

763
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,199
- You think the bosses will sit idly by?
- Yeah.

764
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:13,460
I'm simple so I don't understand that
our company wants all the profits.

765
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,478
I asked you to keep your troubles
outside the company, didn't I?

766
00:59:16,478 --> 00:59:18,688
I'll be responsible for this one.

767
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,322
I started it with that mindset.

768
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:22,731
Then you should've
kept it a secret from me too.

769
00:59:22,731 --> 00:59:24,391
What are you thinking?

770
00:59:24,391 --> 00:59:26,373
How do you expect me
to take care of this?

771
00:59:26,373 --> 00:59:29,012
- I didn't call you to take care of it.
- Then why?

772
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:30,342
You're my friend.

773
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:35,661
I just didn't want to lie to you.

774
00:59:37,981 --> 00:59:39,594
Are you a cat thinking of the mouse?

775
00:59:39,594 --> 00:59:43,521
Don't worry.
I won't make you clean it up.

776
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:45,092
I really mean it this time.

777
00:59:54,568 --> 00:59:55,869
I really mean it.

778
01:00:00,478 --> 01:00:03,157
Oh, Jae Hoon.

779
01:00:03,157 --> 01:00:04,585
You're here?

780
01:00:04,585 --> 01:00:06,626
I just bought all this food.

781
01:00:06,626 --> 01:00:07,925
Do you want to come in and eat?

782
01:00:07,925 --> 01:00:10,567
I told you not to get involved in
Hyuk's business.

783
01:00:10,567 --> 01:00:12,786
But, you let things get
out of hand like this?

784
01:00:12,786 --> 01:00:14,675
Hyuk made the decision to do it.

785
01:00:14,675 --> 01:00:16,847
I'm just getting paid and helping.

786
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:20,548
If you weren't encouraging him,
where would he get the idea to do it?

787
01:00:21,987 --> 01:00:24,559
Aren't you underestimating
your friend too much?

788
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,414
Do you think Hyuk's
my avatar or something?

789
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,282
You got Hyuk to turn himself in.

790
01:00:28,282 --> 01:00:32,833
He got rid of service contractors
and you got him hired as an intern.

791
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:35,286
Now, he's trying to solve this
subcontractor issue.

792
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:36,954
How can I not say this?

793
01:00:38,882 --> 01:00:42,474
After hearing your side of it,
I suppose I understand.

794
01:00:43,813 --> 01:00:48,052
But, Hyuk made the call on all of that
and came to his own decision.

795
01:00:48,052 --> 01:00:49,411
You doing this...

796
01:00:50,637 --> 01:00:52,014
is it related to your father?

797
01:01:06,527 --> 01:01:07,780
What are you doing?

798
01:01:08,947 --> 01:01:11,086
Are you digging into my background?

799
01:01:11,086 --> 01:01:12,605
I told you.

800
01:01:12,605 --> 01:01:15,695
I have to know about people around Hyuk.

801
01:01:15,695 --> 01:01:19,393
Yes, my dad worked for Gangsu Foods.

802
01:01:19,393 --> 01:01:20,713
What about it?

803
01:01:20,713 --> 01:01:22,576
What does that have to do with Hyuk?

804
01:01:22,576 --> 01:01:24,657
It really has no connection?

805
01:01:24,657 --> 01:01:27,237
You have no intentions regarding Hyuk?

806
01:01:27,237 --> 01:01:30,235
What's your motive
in saying these things?

807
01:01:30,235 --> 01:01:33,483
What intentions? What kind
of intentions would I have with Hyuk...

808
01:01:35,257 --> 01:01:38,148
Do you... like Hyuk?

809
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:41,518
You're not thinking...

810
01:01:44,315 --> 01:01:46,367
What are you imagining, Kwon Jae Hoon?

811
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,539
I'm just curious why
you're always with Hyuk.

812
01:01:51,726 --> 01:01:54,476
Besides helping Hyuk...

813
01:01:54,476 --> 01:01:56,186
there's no other reason, is there?

814
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,548
I must like him.

815
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:10,146
I do get a strange feeling
when I'm looking at Hyuk.

816
01:02:11,405 --> 01:02:16,356
I keep wanting to help him and
I'm proud of him when he tries things.

817
01:02:16,356 --> 01:02:21,007
If I tell you that it's just friendship,
you wouldn't believe me anyway.

818
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:23,536
So, let's just say I like him.

819
01:02:23,536 --> 01:02:24,659
Joon, are you really...

820
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:27,719
I'm getting confused because you
keep asking me these things.

821
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:31,690
How do I feel and why do I always
want to be with Hyuk?

822
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:34,208
I think I need to figure out my feelings.

823
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:38,356
Do I really like Hyuk as a man or not?

824
01:02:38,356 --> 01:02:39,440
Right?

825
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:58,686
I brought you food to eat.
Everyone, eat up!

826
01:02:58,686 --> 01:03:00,923
Yeah, food!

827
01:03:00,923 --> 01:03:03,865
Food is here. Food is here.

828
01:03:03,865 --> 01:03:06,255
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

829
01:03:06,255 --> 01:03:08,134
- Looks good.
- It's sushi?

830
01:03:09,231 --> 01:03:10,664
Come on. Come on.

831
01:03:10,664 --> 01:03:12,340
We'll be eating well today.

832
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,012
Oh my. Looks good.

833
01:03:15,012 --> 01:03:17,110
Oh my! That looks so good.

834
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:18,623
Thank you.

835
01:03:18,623 --> 01:03:20,284
Oh, it's good.

836
01:03:20,284 --> 01:03:22,554
- Eat.
- Have you eaten?

837
01:03:22,554 --> 01:03:24,436
- I ate.
- This looks expensive.

838
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:28,853
Let's eat up.

839
01:03:28,853 --> 01:03:32,088
I... like you.

840
01:03:33,628 --> 01:03:34,963
I said I like you.

841
01:03:37,938 --> 01:03:39,400
So, what?

842
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,000
What am I supposed to do to about that?

843
01:03:44,802 --> 01:03:45,936
<i>Joon.</i>

844
01:04:05,324 --> 01:04:08,117
<i>Honestly, so do I, Joon.</i>

845
01:04:08,117 --> 01:04:11,112
Here's the latte you ordered. Thank you.

846
01:04:11,112 --> 01:04:12,257
Hello...

847
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:22,208
What can I get for you?

848
01:04:29,197 --> 01:04:30,378
An Americano.

849
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:33,447
That's 5,000 won.

850
01:04:36,972 --> 01:04:38,811
<i>[Musical]</i>

851
01:04:41,434 --> 01:04:43,255
Your card, please.

852
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:55,197
One moment, please.

853
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:29,865
I'm here with coffee...

854
01:06:08,096 --> 01:06:10,851
What are you doing here alone?

855
01:06:10,851 --> 01:06:13,242
Joon, look at the sky.

856
01:06:17,398 --> 01:06:21,983
Wow, I can see a lot stars.

857
01:06:23,623 --> 01:06:24,923
They are so pretty.

858
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:27,364
They are pretty.

859
01:06:29,014 --> 01:06:31,034
They're like flying dandelion seeds.

860
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:36,324
Even after that accident,
you still like dandelion seeds?

861
01:06:36,324 --> 01:06:38,304
The dandelion seeds did nothing wrong.

862
01:06:38,304 --> 01:06:40,653
I'm the one at fault
causing accidents everywhere I go.

863
01:07:00,269 --> 01:07:04,193
I'm getting confused because you
keep asking me these things.

864
01:07:04,193 --> 01:07:07,376
Do I really like Hyuk as a man or not?

865
01:07:17,432 --> 01:07:20,856
This time I really
can't cause any trouble.

866
01:07:22,023 --> 01:07:24,302
President Jang's life is on the line.

867
01:07:26,014 --> 01:07:29,947
I can't take care of my own life.
How did I end up responsible for his?

868
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:35,193
You think I can do a good job?

869
01:07:35,193 --> 01:07:38,373
Honestly, I'm so nervous and my heart
feels like it's going to explode.

870
01:07:39,507 --> 01:07:42,934
And Managing Director Seol, no...

871
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,974
I might have to go up against my father.

872
01:07:45,974 --> 01:07:49,574
Be calm and clear.

873
01:07:49,574 --> 01:07:51,713
Tell them what your thoughts are.

874
01:07:53,452 --> 01:07:56,655
You can do a good job.
You are Byun Hyuk.

875
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,838
The first person to tell me
I can do a good job...

876
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:10,387
is you.

877
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:13,929
Thank you, Joon.

878
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:46,048
Can we try once to confirm?

879
01:08:48,801 --> 01:08:49,908
Just to see...

880
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:54,653
if I can be a man to you or not?

881
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,461
What if we try and it feels wrong?

882
01:09:00,461 --> 01:09:01,810
It can't feel wrong.

883
01:09:03,488 --> 01:09:05,109
How do you know that?

884
01:09:05,109 --> 01:09:06,429
I know that much, at least.

885
01:09:13,207 --> 01:09:16,618
All right. Let's try it then.

886
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:19,667
Um, but if it feels wrong...

887
01:09:20,738 --> 01:09:24,798
then we have to remain
friends after that.

888
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:26,377
I don't think that will happen.
