The chicken store that Ji Eun Tak works.
Even the ghosts don't know her whereabouts.

I thought you would be looking for her.

00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,590
Yeah. If she pulls out
the sword you would die.

You told me never to tell her!

There's no other meaning to that.

That's not it. I am in the middle of

Are you him who made her conscious while
eating and works for the country?

95
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,460
Did she cry?

96

Are you perhaps a married man? Is that
why you just let her go like that?

99
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,270
I'm not married but I have a bride
so your judgment isn't wrong.

100
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,790
Then, let's meet again.

what if something happens?

117
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:40,120
Go and come back. If something happens,

00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,100
<i>The incessant fog is also mystic
as if it's something divine.</i>

159
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,680
<i>Breaking news.</i>

160
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,290
<i>This scene that appears to be from a Sci-Fi
film, is the night sky of Seoul today.</i>

161
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,900
<i>Between the buildings the
super moon is shinning high.</i>

162
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,860
<i>With the giant fog and the
purple moon now...</i>

163
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,210
<i>The citizens cannot hide their concern.</i>

164
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,170
Quickly draw out that sword.

165
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,790
Draw that sword, and go into nothingness.

166
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,190
If you don't go into
nothingness, Eun Tak will die.

167
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:13,180
If I... make that choice,

168
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,630
you have to be ready with an excuse.

169
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,310
Father.

170
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,670
8:15.

171
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,740
The patient has passed away.

172
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,530
Father! Father!

173
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,760
Kim Ki Joong, 68 years old. Cause
of death, excessive blood loss.

174
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:42,970
Ah, hot!

175
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,180
Father?

176
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,700
A-

177
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,270
Father?

178
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,460
Oh! Father, did you come back alive,
father? You lost so much blood. This is...

179
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,810
Did you get up?

180
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,076
In front of my eyes, he just
woke up, he's alive. He

181
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:03,050
had excessive blood loss, but
he body colour was good.

182
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,530
The list of names just burned up.
Is this a possible event?

183
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,940
It is possible, if that's the Goblin's fire.

184
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,930
This must be yours.

185
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,880
What is this?

186
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,420
The Goblin's apology.

187
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,020
Apology?

188
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,790
It's socks...

189
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,144
Is apologising in advance enough?
You caused the trouble, so why does

190
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:35,620
the Grim Reaper have to do the overtime?
How dare you burn our list?

191
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:41,000
Has living forever made you go blind?
You two's tragic fate is unfortunate...

192
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,260
but that doesn't mean you can meddle with
a human's life, you senseless goblin!

193
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,990
I just... wanted someone to see it.

194
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,960
It would be good if the deity saw it.

195
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,560
It would be better if Eun Tak saw it.

196
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,790
If you say it like that,
what does that make me?

197
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,460
I shouldn't have said anything.

198
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,270
I should've just let the Miscellaneous
Omitted Person pull out the sword.

199
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,670
You're right. That would've been better.

200
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,090
In this world...

201
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,260
there are many weird beings that
are unexplainable with words.

202
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,640
At times, they're closer
to us than we think.

203
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,880
I think, that you already had an idea.

204
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,490
Yoo Jae Shin.

205
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,330
Sorry.

206
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,960
Eh-hey!

207
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,210
One man who doesn't age, I know one.

208
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,950
Okay...

209
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,756
The passport I made and
accommodations, I prepared

210
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,420
in Nice and making me stay
by Deok Hwa's side...

211
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,250
I believe that you gave me these
jobs to recognise on my own.

212
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,500
Have you by chance spoke of
that existence anywhere?

213
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,420
There is none.

214
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:25,080
Actually, he is the one who picked you.

215
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,680
He made a child without a dream and money,

216
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,750
take the entrance exam, gave him a dream,

217
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:43,980
enrolled him in a university, who do
you think is that faceless helper?

218
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,750
Remember. The person's real name is...

219
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,920
Kim-to, Shin-believe.

220
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,080
Hey, Kim Shin. The supermoon and
the fog, was you right, uncle?

221
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,980
No.. why are you creating such a
mess to find a high school girl?

222
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,580
I'm really scared that NASA
would actually take you away.

223
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,600
Did you drink alcohol?

224
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,590
Yesterday, I drank.

225
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,860
Now, I'm sober.

226
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,533
Anyways, if I do find
her, what would you do

227
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:24,290
for me, uncle? Will you
give me a credit card?

228
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,170
If I cant find her, how will you?

229
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:31,183
She wouldn't have gone far. She
has no money. She has to be

230
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:35,220
somewhere in Korea where you can go by bus.
I have my ways..

<i>[NEWS ALERTS]</i>

237
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,690
I found her. Right now,
she's at a ski resort.

238
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,210
What if...

239
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,860
I say I don't want to be your
bride anymore, what will happen?

240
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,000
Ah...

241
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,920
This sword won't be pulled out.

242
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,970
Only you can do it.

243
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,470
The sword needs to be pulled out...

244
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,710
I...

245
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,270
to become pretty. Right now, I'm not pretty.

246
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:48,200
You don't know, but I'm crazy
for laughing in this situation.

247
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,840
Crazy person.

248
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:02,220
Not today, today I'll just laugh with you.

249
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,740
When the first show comes?

250
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,280
First snow?

251
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,230
You don't need a broom then.

252
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,030
When the first snow comes.

253
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,360
There's a lot of snow.

254
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,430
Let's go home.

255
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,760
You shouldn't stay here alone.

256
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,700
I don't have a house.

257
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:37,350
None of the places I thought were
my home, was actually my home.

258
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,720
People just kept me close, for
some because of insurance.

259
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,750
And for some because they wanted to die.

260
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,800
I now understand it all, I'm the tool
to end the goblin's immortality, I am?

261
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,150
I missed the opportunity to tell you.

262
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,630
Because I missed the
opportunity, I was glad.

263
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,860
If possible, until the moment of death

264
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,300
I was about to lose every opportunity.

265
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,850
But I shouldn't do that.

266
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,720
The blood of thousands is on this sword.

267
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,380
The weight of a person's life

268
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,130
it should not be up to my judgement.

269
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,400
So take this sword out. I ask of you.

270
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,210
No.

271
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,430
I don't want to. I don't
want to even if I die.

272
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,180
So don't look for me. Don't look for me

273
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,430
and let's live as separate people
who don't know each other.

274
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,900
Go far from me,

275
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,790
and live for a very very long time, Mr.
Kim Shin.

276
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,510
Do you understand?

277
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,350
Don't appear again.

278
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:10,090
If you appear in front of my eyes again,

279
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,240
then I will really kill you then.

You call this an excuse.

302
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,530
I was happy to have this as an excuse.

303
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,110
Even like this,

304
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,880
an excuse that I can come see you.

305
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,780
What do you want to do after seeing me?

306

If you appear before me again,

309
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,200
did I tell you that I would kill you or not?

310

Fine, come here.

311
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,930
I will pull out the sword.

312
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,650
If that is your wish so bad then
I will pull it out for you.

Come here now.

Don't.

317
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,830
Do it. You have to do it.

318
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,800
Let go! Let go!

319
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,180
Let go! Let go, I said!

320
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,700
It was from that moment.

321
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,930
In the hotel, when you appeared

322
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,130
it was from that moment.

323
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,350
<i>Ahjussi, do you love me?</i>

324
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,260

So... did you really love me?

328
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,100
No?

329
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,840
You didn't even just a bit?

330
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,740
I was scared.

331
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,300
I'm so scared.

332
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,670
So, you keep...

333
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,430
I wished you would keep needing me.

334
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,670
I wish I could do even that.

335
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,460
That excuse to get permission

336
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,700
I wish I would have it.

337
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,220
With that excuse, I...

338
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,840

Hello. It's the customer's personal errand.
Edge waxing.

00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,940
He's asking to have it done within one hour.

I'm rotating right now so

353
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,780
Let's wait. - Yes.

354
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,450
Why are you alone? What about
Miscellaneous Omitted Person?

355
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,500
You didn't meet her? - I met her.

356
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,290
But she's not coming. -
What on earth happened?

357
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,410
It's my first time waiting for
a document to be processed.

358

Miscellaneous Omitted Person's roll is out.

Are you sure it's Eun Tak's?

360
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,000
It's empty. - There is writing.

361
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,310
What on earth is this situation?

362
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,370
It was as if someone pushed for her death.

363
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,620
That's not me.

364
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,340
And all the more not you. - It must be me.

365
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,690
I have to die for her to live.

366
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:08,210
If I live then she dies.

367
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,830
That is the fate of that child and me.

368
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,340
This is the punishment
that was bestowed to me.

369
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,170
God had a greater reason.

370
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:20,580
Don't say something so weak.
Even if it was God's will

371
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,400
but it is not mine.

372

You will also be the same.

373
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,660
One hour from now, the time of death.
You should hurry.

it several times.</i>

378

now and more severe.</i>

Ji Eun Tak. Have you come to your senses?

This is the hospital.

394
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,650
You showed symptoms of
hypothermia and concussion.

395
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,160
It's a relief that you're okay.
If you were even a little

396
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:22,390
bit late, your condition
would've become dangerous.

Ah.

401
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,200
Then, what about the hospital fee?

Ah. You don't need to worry about that.

403

But, what is your relationship
with the CEO of Cheonho Group?

404
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,885
The Chairman himself came
in to admit you into the

405
00:41:47,897 --> 00:41:50,640
hospital. The entire
hospital was in an uproar.

406
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,220
If you want, you can be discharged.

407
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,790
I recommend staying here for your safety...

408
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,670
I'm sorry, but

409
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,560
by chance, does anyone
have a match or lighter...

410

Pardon?

This woman, if you're wary
of men, you can't date!

471
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:09,700
Grim Reaper? You have to be believable
if you want to write me a talisman.

472
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,650
Then who is this man? He's very tall.

473
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,820
He seems a little older than me and
looks kind of like Gong Yoo...

474
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,933
His voice... if you listen
to him, you feel as

475
00:50:21,945 --> 00:50:25,270
though you're at the smallest
cafe in the world...

476
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,920
Gong Yoo?

477
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,370
Then stay well.

478
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,070
Did you receive a sparkling
item from somewhere?

479
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,390
- How did you know that?
- Throw it away.

480
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:46,630
You can't take things whose
previous owners are unknown.

481
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:53,460
You don't know what's inside. There might
be the owner's crimes, sins, desires, etc.

482
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:04,500
What crimes, what sins,

483
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,010
and what desires would be inside this?

484
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,120
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to cause you trouble.

485
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:30,360
I always have to contact him first.

486
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,940
Right now?

487
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,120
Aish.

488
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,870
<i>- Are you busy?</i> - Yes. I'm
so busy, I'm going insane.

489
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,460
<i>What are you doing right now?</i>

490
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,258
I'm trying to figure out my passcode.
I want to

491
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,080
turn it off, ust in case
it makes another sound.

492
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,360
<i>The passcode failed. Try
again in one minute.</i>

493
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,010
(WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?)

494
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:57,270
(WHY AREN'T YOU TRYING TO CONTACT ME AGAIN?)

495
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,850
Oh... That's...

496
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:09,470
Firstly, because I feel sorry about
having erased your memory. Secondly,

497
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:19,980
<i>Who are you, and why are you so beautiful?</i>

498
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,330
I thought I started to have
a crush on someone else.

499
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:28,410
I'm sorry. I am also feeling very
confused about myself for being this way.

500
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,250
It seems like you've gotten a message.

501
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,660
I miss you.

502
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:44,970
- Me too.
- Why am I constantly like this...

503
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:47,170
No, I haven't heard anything.

504
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:51,660
I didn't hear anything, I didn't
hear anything, I didn't...

505
00:52:53,320 --> 00:53:02,430
Glory, glory, glory, hallelujah

506
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,380
I know that you're there!
Come out and show yourself!

507
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,350
How dare a lowly ghost is
trying to harm a human being?

508
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,020
Come out, not get out! Get lost!

509
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,070
If you don't obey me,
I'll sing the song again!

510
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:17,120
Glory, glory, glory, hallelujah

511
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,670
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah.

512
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,870
Why are you empty-handed? What about your
luggage? Weren't you on your way home?

513
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,580
No, I was on heading to my workplace.

514
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:36,080
Since it's Christmas season, they pay
really well. I'm glad I didn't get fired.

515
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,012
Let's finish up what we're
supposed to do. Then,

516
00:53:38,024 --> 00:53:39,650
let's buy some beef
and go to Geumweewon.

517
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,220
Until when? Until when are
you going to be here?

518
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:46,690
What do you mean by until when? Until all
of February's snow at the ski resort melt.

519
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,120
You can go back home first.

520
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,500
What? February?!

521
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,520
President Yu. Yes, President Yu, it's me.

522
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,020
I was going to ask you to fire
someone using your vast network.

523
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,409
Otherwise, I'm planning to
quickly melt all the snow

524
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:03,550
at the ski resort. Which
option shall I go for?

525
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,840
I'm back.

526
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,260
I'm sorry. You would have worried a lot.

527
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,853
I worred a little, this
guy's the one who worried a

528
00:54:16,865 --> 00:54:18,470
lot. / The one who found out
about you was Deok Hwa.

529
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,160
And the one who got you here is me.

530
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:27,050
It's the first time to have a place
to return to, so I'm feeling weird.

531
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:29,690
It feels like this place
is now really my home.

532
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:31,761
This girl's starting again...
You have a sad story

533
00:54:31,773 --> 00:54:33,570
to tell each time I ask
you about something!

534
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,960
I'd feel afraid to ask
you to come back home.

535
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:41,790
Just wear it. You should come with me.

536
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:48,200
Where are you going to take my Ajuhshi?
That's something I feel sensitive about.

537
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:53,670
'my'... she said 'my' Ajuhshi...!!

538
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:56,520
I can hear everything, you cheesy Goblin!

539
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,820
He said he was happy that you
referred to him with the pronoun "my"

540
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:05,260
Follow me quickly! Leave that soup there!

541
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,030
Btw, who are you submitting this report to?

542
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:17,460
Are you submitting it directly to...?

543
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,698
It doesn't get handed in to that far up.
They probably created

544
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,960
our jobs because they didn't want
to read all of those reports.

545
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,950
I think they should be of
the same handwriting though

546
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:29,190
I'll say that it's been written with my
left hand, so just shut up and write!

547
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,870
Btw she seemed pretty - the ownder of the
chicken restaurant you visit frequently

548
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:40,100
You met her? You didn't tell her
anything useless by any chance, did you?

549
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,990
What I told her wasn't something
that was particularly useful.

550
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,610
You told her? That I was a Reaper?

551
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:46,670
You told her too! That I would disappear
to nothing once the sword gets pulled out.

552
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,650
Did you really tell her? Really?

553
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,670
Wow, how can you...?
You... really... you / Ohhh how...

554
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:00,450
How... how... someone's
coming in, coming in!

555
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:06,380
Hey there, I'm really sorry, but it's
an emergency... Could I use the toilet?

556
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,780
This is a human being, right?

557
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:12,040
It's not an immortal for sure... But
human beings cannot enter this place!

558
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:12,880
Wow

559
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,530
Please... What should I do...
It's urgent!! AAA!!!

560
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:19,460
Thank you, thank you. It's really urgent.

561
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,710
Wow... There is no door that a human
being's desperation can't open.

562
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,260
I can't believe it even after witnessing it.

563
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,564
You even believe in God
that's not visible. Then, why

564
00:56:30,576 --> 00:56:32,720
can't you believe a human
being, which is visible?

565
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,592
That's called the persistency
of a human being. The power

566
00:56:34,604 --> 00:56:36,390
that enables them to change
their destiny on their own!

567
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:40,910
How can an immortal's tea-place be
a human being's mark of territory?

568
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:44,480
How can I write an explanation
report for this case...!

569
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,590
Sit.

570
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:49,750
Write this one too, it
happened because of you!

571
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,080
You can make Deok Hwa do
it when you get home.

572

You can ask me about anything

Yes! I'll take care of
everything very methodically!

Btw, how did you come to a better place?

584
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:11,230
Life has very simple explanations.
I returned my apartment-on-lease.

585
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,500
How did you find me here without
even calling me beforehand?

586
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,360
I have my own means.

Even ghosts would be surprised.

588

Are you a beggar? How can an
elementary student not even have $1?

589
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,820
You guys don't have money either!!

590
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:37,160
That's why I'm telling you to bring it.
Then, we would have it.

Don't hit me! Strong wind!!

read comic books all the time.

Someday, you'll be able to shoot a real
strong wind. Where's your home? Is it near?

I'm not joking, someone
else paid for your tuition.

607
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:22,200
He told me to mention his name, Shin Kim,
if you ever call me for confirmation.

608
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,760
Mr. Shin Kim? You paid my tuition?

609

Hey...

610
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,690
I beseeched them to keep it secret.

611
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:45,010
According to her, you asked her to make sure
to let me know that you had paid it for me.

612
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:48,630
She insisted on knowing my name,
so I couldn't help but tell her

613
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:51,457
According to her, she kept
asking you about the name

614
01:00:51,469 --> 01:00:54,200
of the student, but you
kept telling her your name.

615
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,860
I'm not sure if this would be an
appropriate university acceptance gift.

616

It's appropriate! Wow that's great, wow!

01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:14,860
I really missed you! A
purse, perfume, five...

620
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:18,360
There's no 5 million won. I
paid your tuition with that.

621
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:22,560
Ahjussi...

622
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,630
Don't be too moved. I'm lending it to you.

623
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:33,990
I know... why did you give it to me at
first, but you're lending it to me now?

624
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,520
How could a person's heart change?

625
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,390
You're the only mortal in this house.
How can you not know that yet?

626
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:40,660
- Daebak...
- 5208 won per month...

627
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:43,490
Pay it over 80 years. You
can't miss even a month.

628
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:44,730
80 years?

629
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:47,760
Yeah, you can't pay back sooner either.

630
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,030
- What? You don't like it?
- No.

631
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:55,290
If you're so determined like this, I
made up my mind. I set my mind to it.

632
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:56,500
About what?

633
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,440
A date.

634
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:07,300
Dummy... when I was at the ski
resort, not my report card...

635
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,060
If you had brought this purse, I
would've came back with you right away.

636
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,490
Wow... that's exactly
what I was going to do.

637
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,390
- The Grim Reaper ahjussi stopped you, huh?
- Yeah!

638
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:18,280
As expected... the Grim Reaper
ahjussi saved someone's life.

639
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,730
Or I would've killed you on the spot.

640
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:23,280
Don't eat mine. Eat yours.

641
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,820
I ate all of mine.

642
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:28,110
- Don't smile and keep eating.
- Just one bite.

643
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,160
- But you know...
- What now?

644
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,590
Do these things have love
out there somewhere?

645
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:44,630
Look carefully. I tried my
best to put them in there.

646
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,691
Here is the list of gifts
you asked for that

647
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:55,360
female highschooler or
college students prefer.

648
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,230
BTS?

649
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:05,030
What do these boys do?

650
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:10,040
♫ <i>Why do you make my heart waver?
Make my heart waver?</i> ♫

651
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:15,020
Oh... they work to change people's hearts.

652
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:17,170
They're wavering people's
hearts quite a bit these days.

653
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:20,600
EXO? Is that an alcoholic beverage?

654
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,060
No, it's not.

655
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:28,100
♫ <i>Growl, growl, growl.</i> ♫

656
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:32,210
Being an executive assistant
is an extreme job. Yeah...

657
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,620
I enjoy my job very much.

658
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:39,300
I'll choose number three for the gift.

659
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,450
Oh...

660
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:47,290
I know what digital camera is.

661
01:03:55,620 --> 01:04:00,960
<i>Dear Ji Eun Tak, you worked hard.</i>

662
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,060
<i>I hope each moment is remembered forever.</i>

663
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,390
<i>From Yoo Shin Woo</i>

664
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:11,220
- Oh, you scared me!
- Aigoo, he scared me.

665
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,390
Since when were you standing here?

666
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:15,870
Why are you so shocked? Did
you do something wrong?

667
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:19,330
I was surprised by my face.

668
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,800
I'm handsome, huh? I'm too much...
too much...

669
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,760
You said you don't even have any money.
What's with the camera?

670
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,630
Ah, it's yours.

671
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,200
Why is that mine?

672
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,740
A gift from my grandpa. My
selfie if my gift to you.

673
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,660
Really?

674
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,200
I'm so touched.

675
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,151
The only gift I ever
received was a building. You

676
01:04:44,163 --> 01:04:46,830
must be so happy to
receive a digital camera.

677
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:51,300
Please tell the Chairman
I'm so, so grateful.

678
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,400
Please give me my camera.

679
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:57,760
Give me ten minutes.

680
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:00,480
- Give it back.
- Five minutes.

681
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,630
- Give it back - Fi-, Five Minuites.

682
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:04,900
Ah, give it!

683
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:05,760
Three minutes.

684
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,160
Give it now!

685
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,730
Three minutes.

686
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:09,440
Give it!

687
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,470
Three, Three. Oh it's the goblin!

688
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:20,090
If there's kids in a house, it
really does make the house livelier.

689
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:27,020
I would've told you if I did.

690
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,760
Anyway I was curious. What will you do now?

691
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:36,440
Do you remember that man who barged
into your tea room, one time?

692
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,950
How could I forget him? But why?

693
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:44,530
A human's desperation can open any door.

694
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:50,000
Maybe that one door opens in a way, that
could be a variable in the deity's plan.

695
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:55,140
So I plan to start searching, desperately.

696
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:59,860
What door do I need to open,
to change the deity's plans?

697
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:04,855
It might take 100 years, or
10 months, I don't know, but

698
01:06:04,867 --> 01:06:08,350
for now I have decided to
stay by that child's side.

699
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:13,940
And then I might be able to open a door.

700
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:16,100
I just hope it's not the room to my door.

701
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:20,870
But why would a deity be
involved in a human's passings.

702
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:22,980
Why is the reason for the deity to do that?

703
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,810
I was feeling reay touched right then.

704
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:26,720
Uncles!

705
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,280
Me too! Me too!

706
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,930
Me too, me too, me too!

707
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:36,380
Now... are you ready to take it?

708
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:38,800
Why are you here? Just the two...

709
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,650
I don't want to! I sat here first.

710
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:42,540
I'm going to take it.

711
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,760
Ah.

712
01:06:55,784 --> 01:07:07,784
<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd

713
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,020
I have a question, I'll move if you answer.

714
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,660
Ah, what is it now?

715
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,201
<i>Backing out suddenly
while driving, solving</i>

716
01:07:17,213 --> 01:07:18,940
<i>math problems writing
with mechanical pencil...</i>

717
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,650
Smiling when she talks.

718
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:22,580
Keeping off the roads away from the cars

719
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,590
Our boss, you'll never know what she wants.

720
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:26,800
Be ready for anything.

721
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,740
What are you doing since then?
After calling 100 times...

722
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,760
It's dangerous, so I want you to
walk on the inside of the pavement.

723
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,860
By acting that awkwardly?

724
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:48,120
You had something to say, so say
it first since I'm curious.

725
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,520
I have no religion.

726
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,000
What?

727
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,100
Why does he talk so well?

728
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,640
By any chance, do you have a religion?

729
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:01,920
Where you still thinking
about that until now?

730
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,450
I didn't get to tell you last time.

731
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:08,560
Why have you been smiling so much since?

732
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,450
Me? What? Does my makeup look weird?

733
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:15,760
Don't you think I'm cute?

734
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,880
Where? Why didn't you meet me on Christmas?

735
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,690
You would have been cute that if you
came that day. What did you do?

736
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:23,500
You wouldn't have a gone to a church.

737
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,820
Christmas is a bit... you know.

738
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:30,720
It's someone's birthday, it would
be wrong to go against it.

739
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:36,920
But, I said I have no religion, do
you seriously think I'm not cute?

740
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,310
Ah, goosebumps...

741
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:41,520
Did you have to go that far?

742
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,820
No, it's deja vu.

743
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:47,440
I remember this from before.
It's so fresh in my mind.

744
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,620
Ah, I got goosebumps!

745
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,640
You didn't have to walk me.

746
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:00,010
Why are you telling me that
now that we're already here?

747
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,390
See you.

748
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:05,220
Oh! It's the grim reaper!

749
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:11,290
Most of our sales come from that
person's pocket. Unlike someone else...

750
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:14,790
How much is fried chicken? I
could buy the whole shop.

751
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:18,740
Eh... you're scared of chicken
blood, I read up all on goblins.

752
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:22,150
I'm not scared of it, I just
like to keep a distance from it.

753
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:26,180
Wait... Is that why you got me a job
at chicken shop in the first place?

754
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:28,910
To keep away from me?

755
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:30,610
Ah, that was a while ago...

756
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:34,900
So it's true? Is that what you wanted,
I didn't even know that. Enough now...

757
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,431
I know so you can go now.
I will live over there

758
01:09:37,443 --> 01:09:39,570
for 1000 years, don't
come looking for me

759
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:40,280
Coward!

760
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,830
What? What did you say to me?

761
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:45,420
Ah, It's the first time I've heard that been
said. It's really my first time, really!

762
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:52,190
Before people would say to me, 'Hooray!'

763
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:56,880
Shall I show you how brave I am?

764
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,280
Where are you going?

765
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,350
Our boss isn't like most other women.

766
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,310
By any chance is he the
man giving you trouble?

767
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:31,880
They can hear all.

768
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:42,350
You don't know my voice. It's isn't that
person's voice, that phone call from then?

769
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,200
They can hear all, shut up!

770
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,260
Is that so?

771
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:52,050
We meet again, I didn't know
that you two were friends...

772
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:54,800
He came to the old shop looking for you.

773
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,590
Ah, I see...

774
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:58,360
How much did you say? Not much.

775
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,770
Yeah, he didn't. So I still
don't know who he is.

776
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:02,690
Excuse me, but how old are you?

777
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:05,240
Don't ask if your excusing.

778
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:09,380
That's how you evade my question, huh?

779
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:11,520
I'm not evading. I'm flat
out denying to answer you.

780
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,640
You're words are so rude! Why?

781
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,360
Why is it?

782
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,980
I'm much older than I look,
I'm a quite complicated man.

783
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:25,711
Now, now... if you have
had enough, please

784
01:11:25,723 --> 01:11:28,240
leave. It's a time when
we get many customers.

785
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,100
I still haven't eaten yet.

786
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,580
No, you've eaten all. Now
please just go home.

787
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,430
Because of you things have gone weird!

788
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:38,470
Customer, you should both leave together.

789
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:40,200
Get up both of you, quickly!

790
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,190
No!

791
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:02,310
Let's see. What is X? What's X?

792
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,060
What are you doing?

793
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,450
You really don't know a lot about women.

794
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:08,020
It doesn't look like you know the answer.

795
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:11,330
Just drink your beer.

796
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,420
Excuse me, Kim Sun.

797
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:18,570
Two beers over here please.

798
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,640
Who?

799
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:35,910
Two beers.

800
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:41,860
Can I talk to you for a moment.
Outside, in private!

801
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:45,020
Ah, okay.

802
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:54,410
What!

803
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:55,240
What was what?

804
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:59,930
Just now, you called me Kim Sun.

805
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:01,130
What about that?

806
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:03,120
How do you know my name?

807
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,020
I'm sure that I never told you my real name.

808
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:11,010
<i>Sorry, we didn't meet</i>

809
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:17,630
How do you know it? Why do you know it?

810
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:24,020
I said Kim Sunny.

811
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:26,970
It very cold right? I'll get your coat.

812
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:29,790
I haven't finished talking.

813
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:19,240
<i>What is this?</i>

814
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:27,020
Something went wrong.

815
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:34,200
Maybe, it started with you,
that's what it seems like.

816
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,630
<i>What's the matter?</i>

817
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:11,330
Why exactly?
